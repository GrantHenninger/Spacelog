CC:  Jim, Houston here. Two items: first of all,
     your PTC is looking very good and it should
     carry you through the night; second point, have
     a procedure to give you, if you're ready to
     copy. We'd like to set three bits in the computer,
     and I'll explain why.

[33883]
_page : 47
_tape : Tape 7/1
LMP: Go ahead, Vance, we're ready to copy.

[33886]
_page : 47
_tape : Tape 7/1
CC:  Okay. The procedure is as follows: VERB 25,
     NOUN 07, ENTER; 1331, ENTER; 7, ENTER; and ENTER.
     Explanation as follows. During the P23s, there
     was one time when VERB 37 was entered into the
     computer at about 16 seconds after the OPTICS
     ZERO switch was flicked to ZERO. This is a very
     uncommon anomaly in that, if you do this during -
     0.4-second interval at around 16 seconds after
     you zero the optics, some OPT-mode bits are
     reset; and this would mean that, if you had a
     OCDU fail, it wouldn't be indicated; so all this
     procedure is doing is setting these three bits
     back again where they should be.

[33961]
_page : 47
_tape : Tape 7/1
LMP: Okay, Vance, and I guess I'll try to be slower
     on that VERB 37.

[33967]
_page : 47
_tape : Tape 7/1

[41440]
_page : 54
_tape : Tape 8/3
CC:  A couple of items, Jim. The first is, the time
     for closing the waste stowage vent is 12:24. If
     you turn in before that time, why it's okay as far
     as we're concerned down here to close it before
     that time just before you go to bed. The second
     point, we have some results on the P23s, and, if
     Jack's interested, we could give him the corrected
     altitudes we're getting, and so forth.

[41478]
_page : 54
_tape : Tape 8/3
CMP: Yes. I sure am, Vance.

[41486]
_page : 54
_tape : Tape 8/3
CC:  Okay. This is preliminary results, but it will
     give you some indication. Corrected altitude is
     turning out to be 17 plus or minus 4 kilometers,
     and the fact that it's plus or minus 4 kilometers
     indicates that you're being very consistent in
     judging the altitude. The effective altitude is
     turning out to be 10 plus or minus 12 kilometers.
     Comments are that, as I said before, you're being
     consistent on the horizon selection. The substellar point error is averaging 15 arc-minutes
     and if you could hold the rates to a minimum, you
     might shoot for 5 arc-minutes. That's the only
     comment there. Over.

     little south of the flight plan value. We have
     it at a GET of about 77 plus 51 which is just
     before AOS, and the LOI pads are a little bit
     late, and as I say, it's still pretty soft, and

     got for you, Jack, is three additional questions
     for the booster systems debriefing, which is to
     take place at about 25 hours, and we thought we'd
     pass these questions up to you early so you can
     consider them. Over.

[84255]
_page : 65
_tape : Tape 16/1
_extra : 
CC:  Okay. The first extra is, and let me get the
     original question because this question says,
     "More specifically on item 2," and item 2 says,
     "Were there any significant changes in the noise
     vibration level during the single stage of
     powered flight?" Specifically, describe your
     observations during the early S-II center engine
     out-off, and approximately 90 seconds prior to
     TLI cut-off, you reported a high vibration in
     the S-IVB. We'd like you to describe the buildup
     of this vibration and its behavior through cut-off. Over.

[84302]
_page : 66
_tape : Tape 16/2
CDR: Okay. Essentially, what you'd like us to talk
     about is vibration sequence during the early
     S-II cut-off of the center engine and also
     describe the vibrations that we encountered
     during the S-IVB TLI burn. Is that correct?

[84317]
_page : 66
_tape : Tape 16/2
CC:  That's it. Okay. The second extra question is
     for you, Jim, and it says, "Comparing this flight
     with your ride on Apollo 8, were there any significant differences in the powered flight
     environment?"

[84335]
_page : 66
_tape : Tape 16/2
CDR: Okay. We'll describe a comparison with 8 and 13
     as far as powered flight goes.

[84341]
_page : 66
_tape : Tape 16/2
CC:  Roger. And the last additional question is what
     did the ORDEAL ball look like during TLI? As
     you know, we passed you an update to that setting,
     and we'd like to know whether it was riding right
     on zero or what during the burn. Over.

[84360]
_page : 66

CDR: Okay. Will do. We'll describe the ORDEAL ball.

[84363]
_page : 66
_tape : Tape 16/2

     plan update. I have a consumables update now if
     you want to listen to that.

     the Braves got five or six runs in the - five runs
     in the ninth inning, but they just made it; and in
     the other important game of the day, the Cubs were
     rained out. I have all the rest of the scores,
     you can tell me if you want any of them. They
     had earthquakes in Manila and other areas of the

     they kept the buildings shaking for about a half
     an hour or so, and it was about a 5 on the Richter
     scale. Okay, let's see. The Beatles have announced they will no longer perform as a group.
     The quartet is reported to have made in excess of

     for this pad, and in case the question arises in
     your mind, we don't expect any problem there for

     all the time although it seemed to - to grow to
     us as the burn progressed, although that may have
     been just due to the boost weight decrease.

[90930]
_page : 73
_tape : Tape 17/2
CC:  Okay, you called this about 3-1/2 minutes, but I
     guess the thing was slowly building up throughout
     the whole burn. Right?

[90940]

     much more smooth than even it was on 13.

[90984]
_page : 74
_tape : Tape 17/3
CDR: Okay, now, in answer to number 3, we did not experience any unexpected transients except that
     all of us noticed the PU shift. We thought it
     was more pronounced than we had expected it to be.

[90999]
_page : 74
_tape : Tape 17/3
CC:  Okay. Understand.

[91002]
_page : 74
_tape : Tape 17/3
CMP: Joe, on that. I guess most of every time that PU
     shift occurred we all - almost all of us glanced
     at the engine light. We could feel definite
     acceleration change.

[91018]
_page : 74

     Alfa meter, to my knowledge, nearly went above
     25 percent.

[91026]
_page : 74
_tape : Tape 17/3
CC:  Okay.

[91034]
_page : 74
_tape : Tape 17/3
CDR: In answer to number 4, we got a pretty good look
     at the thermal shroud and the IU after taking the
     LM away, and from our viewpoint, the shroud was
     completely intact. I saw no loose particles or
     parts of it floating at all.

[91050]

_tape : Tape 17/3
CC:  Okay, Jim. Understand.

[91060]
_page : 74

CC:  Roger.

[91079]
_page : 74
_tape : Tape 17/3

     no. We saw no venting or suspected leak on the
     LM or the CSM ...

[91094]
_page : 74
_tape : Tape 17/3
CC:  Okay, Jim. I guess you described to us the non-propulsive venting on the S-IVB after the APS
     maneuver and we copied that at the time.

[91110]
_page : 74
_tape : Tape 17/3
CDR: Okay. Fred saw the S-IVB venting.

[91113]
_page : 74
_tape : Tape 17/3
_extra : 
LMP: Yes, we had already talked about that, Joe. And
     that was also visible when it - of course, when
     it did its evasive maneuver when we were looking
     at it right close up.

_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4
CC:  Roger.

[91152]
_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4
CDR: Okay, Joe. The last time we saw the S-IVB positively was when Fred saw it venting at about - at
     about 5 hours. We think we might have picked it
     up later on. We saw a particle or something out
     there that was tumbling which might have been the
     booster or one of the SLA panels.

[91174]
_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4
CC:  And when was that, Jim?

[91181]
_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4
CDR: We're - we're debating. It was somewhere between -
     say 7:30 and 9 hours.

[91187]
_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4
CC:  Okay.

[91190]
_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4
LMP: But, Joe, assuming the S-IVB is still stable.
     The object I was looking at was definitely
     tumbling.

[91201]
_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4
CC:  Okay, Fred. As I recall, it was stable then,
     although it's tumbling now.

[91208]
_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4
LMP: Okay. It probably was the SLA panel I picked up.

[91214]
_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4

[91217]

_tape : Tape 17/4
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[91219]
_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4
CDR: I - I think we answer to number 9. We - at
     around 5:32, I think, was when we think the
     number 5 light came on in the S-II, and a
     definite vibration which was more than just a
     high-frequency vibration we got with the normal
     S-IV burn, and then the light came on. I called
     ECO thinking from the training that it was 7:42
     and looked up at the time and realized it was
     early. And then, soon after the light came on,
     the vibration stopped and the engine or the
     booster smoothed down. It was very smooth from
     there on.

[91259]
_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4
CC:  Okay. This may be a stupid question, but do you
     have any idea what the frequency of it was?

[91268]
_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4
_extra : 
CDR: Only to say that it was much higher - I couldn't
     really guess now. It was rather a rapid longitudinal vibration.

[91283]

     vibrations?

[91400]
_page : 76
_tape : Tape 17/5
CC:  I don't think so. When you get all done, I'll -
     I'll make a quick check to see if the booster
     people have any - any additional questions. You
     skipped number 8, Jim; could you go back to that
     for a second?

[91414]
_page : 76
_tape : Tape 17/5
CDR: Okay, stand by.

[91434]
_page : 76
_tape : Tape 17/5
CDR: Our only comment there, Joe, was that the burn on
     TLI, to our knowledge, was about 3-3/4 second
     longer than had been predicted and that was the
     only thing that we really noticed; otherwise,
     looked like PI [?] was nominal at cut-off.

[91451]
_page : 76
_tape : Tape 17/5
CC:  Okay, understand.

[91463]
_page : 76
_tape : Tape 17/5
CDR: Okay, on comparing the flight of 13 to Apollo 8,
     lift-off was about the same amount of vibration
     as I noticed on 8, but at the beginning of the
     flight, there was less of the sideways motion
     than we experienced on Apollo 8. The S-IC separation felt more violent on 13 than it did on 8,
     maybe that's because I was in a different seat, I
     don't know. But there was about three sharp
     transients of the cut-off and a couple of big
     bangs where we were thrown backwards longitudinally
     on our straps before the S-II went off. And the
     S-II was, of course, Just as smooth on 13 as 8
     except for the number 5 engine. And we did not
     experience the vibration that we experienced on
     8 towards the end of the S-II burn. And the
     S-IVB was - had more vibration than we had on 8.

[91531]

CC:  Okay, Jim, got all that.

[91539]
_page : 77
_tape : Tape 17/6
CDR: The up - the update on the ORDEAL ball was a
     good one. At the burn, we were about - just
     about 8 degrees. We had to pitch down. The yaw
     was right on all the way through the entire burn,
     and just towards the end of the burn, the ball
     started going black in pitch a little bit.

[91563]
_page : 77
_tape : Tape 17/6
CC:  Okay, sounds good, we'll give Mike Wash a gold
     star on that one. Okay, Jim, stand by 1 while
     I see if we have any extra questions.

[91604]
_page : 77
_tape : Tape 17/6
CC:  Jim, while we're waiting to see if they have any
     more questions, I'd like to read you the booster
     people's preliminary analysis on the - the S-II
     cut-off. Over.

[91618]
_page : 77
_tape : Tape 17/6
CDR: That would be very interesting. Go ahead.

[91620]
_page : 77
_tape : Tape 17/6
CC:  Okay, preliminary analysis of the data indicates
     that the center S-II engine vibrated at a somewhat higher amplitude than we've seen on previous
     flights, and it started at about 160 seconds into
     the S-II burn. As a result of these vibrations,
     the engine chamber pressure decreased to the level
     where the two low-level thrust sensors, the thrust-okay sensors, initiated center engine cut-off.
     Early evaluation of data indicates that no damage
     occurred to the engine, and the cause of the increased vibration amplitude is still under investigation. Over.

[91663]
_page : 77
_tape : Tape 17/6
CDR: I thought it was the center engine.

[91668]
_page : 77
_tape : Tape 17/6
CC:  Yes, right.

[91678]
_page : 77
_tape : Tape 17/6
CDR: Joe, do you have any word on what marks we had
     for TLI?

[91684]
_page : 77
_tape : Tape 17/6
CC:  At the time of TLI, as I recall, you had 6 seconds
     longer than the nominal burn which was 3 seconds
     longer than the B-sigma low burn, and you were
     also GO for a second-opportunity TLI if we had required one.

[91704]
_page : 77
_tape : Tape 17/6
CDR: Okay, we were just wondering because it appeared
     to us that we had a longer TLI burn than had been
     predicted.

[91710]
_page : 77
_tape : Tape 17/6
_extra : 
CC:  Yes, you did. We confirmed that - that - that
     cut-off time just about as you saw it, and I don't
     have an explanation for it, but it was within the
     B-sigma margin.

LMP: Okay, Joe. Out window 5, I just picked up the
     tumbling object again so, for sure, it must have
     been a SLA panel. I don't think we could still
     be in the proximity of the S-IV at this time.

[95373]

CC:  I don't think so, Fred. It's several hundred
     miles aft of you. 700 miles is - is the number,
     I'm told. And since the SLA panel didn't make the
     midcourse correction, that might be it.

[95391]
_page : 79
_tape : Tape 18/1
LMP: Yes, it's, I can't really tell for sure even
     through the monocular that it is, but it looks
     the same relative position to the stars. And
     the best I can tell about the same intensity and
     still about the same distance from us.

[95408]

     or is it a point?

[95419]

[95434]
_page : 79
_tape : Tape 18/1
CC:  Okay. Very interesting. We'll see if we can
     figure out where that's relative to you. They
     keep updating the S-IV impact on us a little bit.
     The last guess we had was that it will impact
     about the same longitude we gave you but close
     to zero latitude and a little bit later. You
     still won't be able to see it. And they're saying it might make a - -

     It must be Jim holding the checklist.

_tape : Tape 20/4
LMP: Right. And what Jim's holding now, he's got a
     pen in his hand we've rigged on a string, as sort
     of a simple-minded accelerometer. This burn's
     pretty short and I'm not sure even that's going

_tape : Tape 20/15
CC:  That's right, Jim. It would be good to see what
     you are doing down in the LEB or the far corner
     of the spacecraft where the optics are. Might be
     interesting to describe what you will do in the
     next few minutes in the way of sighting.

[111419]
_page : 99
_tape : Tape 20/16
CDR: While Jack is getting the sleep station rolled
     up, I thought I would show you one interesting
     corner. We've got a temporary stowage bag here
     and that's where all our wastepaper and all that
     goes while we're - after every meal. It's in
     the right-hand corner down by our dump system.

[111436]
_page : 99
_tape : Tape 20/16
CC:  Roger. Understand. We're looking at the
     wastebasket.

[111446]
_page : 99
_tape : Tape 20/16
CDR: And the age-old question that is always asked us
     is how do we get rid of liquid waste and that
     line that you see, I think you can see it now,
     it goes right outside where we open up the overboard drain dump, and all of our waste products,
     liquid waste products, go out through that line
     and get dumped overboard.

[111465]
_page : 99
_tape : Tape 20/16
CC:  Roger. Understand, and we can see somebody's
     foot, as well.

[111471]
_page : 99
_tape : Tape 20/16
CDR: Okay. Fred is now going down there, and he is
     going to try to get underneath the sleep station
     on his side where we have a sleep restraint. And
     the whole object of that is to ... to position
     the body between the - between the bottom of the
     spacecraft and - so it doesn't float up between
     that and the bottom of the couch.

[111494]
_page : 99
_tape : Tape 20/16

     at completion of P23, maneuver to following attitude: roll 101.0, pitch 090.0, yaw 000.0. High
     gain antenna angles will be: pitch minus 23,
     yaw 93. Use normal PTC procedures to dampen rates.
     After vehicle's stable, and before spinup, take
     photographs of Comet Bennett. Use the DAC on the
     sextant with magazine G. That is, very high-speed
     black-and-white film, right? That's the dim-light
     film. Take three photos, one each at 5-, 20-, and
     60-seconds' time exposure. Use AUTO optics.
     NOUN 88 values are R<sub>1</sub> plus 34717, R<sub>2</sub> minus 08028;
     R<sub>3</sub> plus 35075. Take three photos one each at 5-,
     20-, and 60-second time exposure using manual
     optics. Shaft will be 000.8 degrees, trunnion
     12.5 degrees. Comment: Strip off about 50 frames;
     that is, 2 seconds of - at 24 feet per second before the first frame and after the last frame of
     the photos. That is, 2 second - 2 seconds at

     gain angles will be pitch minus 23, yaw 93. And
     we're to use normal PTC procedures to damp the
     rates. And after damping the rates and before
     spinup, we're to put the DAC on the sextant with
     the magazine G, very high-speed black and white
     film. Then, we're to take three photos, one each
     at 5-, 20-, and 60-seconds' time exposure using
     audio - AUTO optics. Our NOUN 88 values R<sub>1</sub>
     plus 34717, R<sub>2</sub> minus 08028, R<sub>3</sub> plus 35075. Thence,
     three more photos, one each at 5-, 20-, 60-seconds'
     time exposure using manual optics. Shaft 0.8 degrees, trunnion 12.5 degrees. And we're to take

     Bennett's Comet - we want the pictures taken when
     the spacecraft is as stable as it's going to be
     before starting PTC. The stability requirement
     is very high. We weren't sure if you understood
     that from what we passed up. In addition, the
     photographs might not show as much as the eye
     can see of the comet, so if you see anything
     interesting about the structure of the comet,
     why, sketching it is in order and is encouraged.
     Over.

[115070]
_page : 104
_tape : Tape 21/3
CMP: Okay, Vance. What we'll do is, when we get to
     attitude, we'll disable the quads and do like we
     did last night; we'll let GUIDO and you people
     down there tell us when you think we are stable
     enough; then we'll do all this work with the DAC
     on the sextant, first; and then when we get that
     done, we'll go back and put the sextant eyepiece
     back on and see what we can observe visually.

[115098]
_page : 104
_tape : Tape 21/3
CC:  Okay. That sounds good. Also, while you are
     waiting for the vehicle to stabilize, it might
     be interesting to have the eyepiece on and be
     looking at it visually. Okay. Next item: your
     SPS burn had no anomalies whatsoever. It was a
     very good burn.

[115162]
_page : 104
_tape : Tape 21/3
CC:  And Apollo 13, another item: something that we
     have observed and you might be seeing is a slight
     TCE fluctuation on fuel cell 3. This fluctuation
     has been going from about 152 to 160 over a
     37-second period. It has been seen on other
     flights in the past. No one is worried about it,
     but the usual fluctuation is about 1-1/2 degrees
     instead of 7 seconds, so I thought you should be
     aware of it.

[115207]
_page : 104
_tape : Tape 21/3
CMP: Okay, Vance. And one other slight distinction
     we've noted is the flow of hydrogen versus the

     either.

     pick it up there. We're pointing pretty much
     right into the Sun, and things are pretty well
     washed out. And I've gone to MANUAL OPTICS and
     I'm trying to get 0.8, 12.5 on the shaft and
     trunnion, and I still can't pick it up. So -
     it's very light in the sextant, so I kind of think
     maybe we're too near the Sun to see it.

     we can generate the pads that we have yet to
     send up before the sleep period, so we could support an earlier sleep period if you so desired.
     And - but, it will take us 30 minutes to get that
     stuff. The other thing is any time you're ready
     to copy, I can read up the solo book changes.
     Over - And, also, two pages in the flight plan.

     And as far as moving up the sleep period, that's
     fine, but we'll - if we don't go to sleep right

     request you re-initialize the PTT - PTC. For
     some reason, it's gone up to 18 degrees in pitch
     and yaw both. We don't quite understand this.
     All we can think of is - start it again. Over.

_page : 116
_tape : Tape 22/9
CC:  Okay. Okay, about - at time 156:50 on the right -
     well, on the right-hand half of the page, there's
     a line which states "Visual target 16, south,
     180 plus 1:11, Gassendi, f:15." Request you
     cross out that line.

[119858]

[119862]
_page : 116

[119890]

     out the first five lines, which are "Set up
     camera for contamination and photography,
     Betelgeuse, CM4/EL/80," et cetera, "MAG T,"

     Cross out "Maneuver to contamination field
     photography attitude," and all other lines
     below that through "Enable thrusters A3, C4,
     B3," et cetera.

[119946]
_page : 116
_tape : Tape 22/9

     changes - flight plan changes we have. And Ken
     is coming on now and later sometime when we get

     work your way from east to west and the charts
     are labeled D, E, and F and the solo stuff will
     all be the D and E, and they change with the

     down to 4 arc-minutes on the substellar-point

     mention. The second is, unless you see a need,
     I don't see any need for you to read back the

     about in case you haven't been briefed on this,
     something that's now being talked about a little
     bit. These conservative people would like to
     have you read the SHe tank pressure when you go
     into the LM for the LM familiarization at
     58 hours. If there's no midcourse-3, and it
     looks like there's a good chance that there will
     not be, why, they might want to move the LM
     familiarization up from 58 to 55 hours. Over.

[127670]
_page : 122
_tape : Tape 23/2
CDR: Okay. If we don't have a midcourse-3, then we'll
     probably move LM FAM up to 55 hours, in which
     case we'll go in there and read SHe tank pressure.

[127682]

[171660]

     have a procedure that we'd like you to carry out
     which is simply turning the H<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters
     to OFF at this time s and we want to see whether
     that won't solve the problem of the tank pressure
     setting off caution and warning. We want to look
     at it that way for a few hours.

[171707]

     Is that correct?

CDR: Okay. Tank 2 heaters off at this time.

[171720]
_page : 130
_tape : Tape 31/2
CC:  Okay. Good deal. That's been the high tank
     and apparently while waiting for that pressure
     switch to close, to start the heater cycle, the
     tank 1 pressure has been dropping even a little
     bit lower and just setting off caution and
     warning, so we feel if we turn off the tank 2
     heater and let tank 1 activate the heater cycle,
     we won't get into the caution and warning range.

     One is a procedure for looking for Comet Bennett

     other update is concerned with going into the
     LM 3 hours early, and I think Vance mentioned
     to you last night that this was a possibility,
     that we'd like to look at the SHe tank pressure
     early. And since we're not going to do midcourse
     3, we'd like LM entry at 55 hours. Is that
     okay with you?

[171941]
_page : 131
_tape : Tape 31/3

     up LM entry to 55 hours.

[171948]
_page : 131
_tape : Tape 31/3
CC:  Okay. I've got some details on the flight plan
     for you as follows. Of course, since there's
     no MCC-3 you'll be deleting all the midcourse 3
     stuff including the - the P52, which is called
     out at about 54-1/2, and we'll be slipping that
     until later, which I'll - which I'll tell -
     which I'll tell - which I'll tell you in a
     minute. Okay. Then you - we want to move the
     battery charge up 3 hours to about 52:30. And
     we want to move the - moving the LM tunnel vent
     valve to LM/CM DELTA-P up B hours to 52:45, and
     at that point you can simply go to the 57-hour
     point in the flight plan and change your number
     from 57 hours to 54 hours and start through that.
     In the remarks section at about 57:50 it says,
     "0<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste water dump," here.
     If not performed earlier, we want you to do that
     at 54 hours and 50 minutes. The TV pass then,
     will be at 55 hours to 55:30. You'll go right
     through the LM Activation checklist stuff. I'm

     there will be 285 degrees, which is per the
     flight plan. The high gain antenna angles are
     slightly different, pitch 23 and yaw 267 degrees.
     The TV pass till 55:30, the standard LM activation except for some special steps we'll give
     you to take a look at SHe tank pressure, which
     I don't have yet. Restart PTC at about 56:30
     or whenever you're through with the LM activities, and after that, at your convenience,
     we'd like you to - to do the P52 option 3 that
     we cancelled at 54-1/2 hours. Over.

     P52 at 49 hours, they've been observing a slight
     jitter in the optics shaft angle of about 0.2 of
     a degree plus or minus. Before you come out of
     the OPTICS ZERO position, at the start of this
     P52, they'd like you to just observe the shaft
     readout, and see if the jitter occurs on your
     direct readout there, and also they'd like you
     to briefly call up a VERB 16, NOUN 91 so we
     can look at the shaft and trunnion angles.

[172691]
_page : 134
_tape : Tape 31/6
CMP: Okay. Let's see if I got it right. On the P52
     at 49 hours, before coming out of ZERO on the
     OPTICS, observe the shaft and also call up
     16, 91 and let you look at the shaft and trunnion
     angles to observe a possible jitter. See
     whether it occurs in the ZERO position as well
     as out of ZERO.

     then add some comments and we'll talk about it
     a little. This should occur sometime after
     49:30. After the P52 realine at 49 hours, if
     time permits we would like the crew to investigate while in PTC if there is a roll angle in
     which the comet can be observed for photos. If # continused from previous page
     there is, record the optimum roll angle for
     possible photography, prior to reinitiating PTC
     at 56:30 or so, whenever the guys are done in
     the LM, use P52 planet option, and the following
     half-unit vectors for tracking Comet Bennett at

[172908]
_page : 135
_tape : Tape 31/7
CC:  Okay. That's correct and the last sentence on
     the update is that you can expect AOS of the
     comet at a roll of 45 degrees and LOS at a roll
     of 155 degrees. Now, the deal here, Jack,
     according to the plots they showed me is, the
     comet appears to be about 10 degrees away from
     the Sun, and due to the geometry of the LM there
     shadowing the Sun, it would appear that you will
     be able to see the comet through the sextant
     without getting Sun shafting between roll angles
     of about 45 degrees and 75 degrees. It appears
     that as your roll gets higher than 75 degrees,
     although the comet is still in the field of view,
     the Sun is also in the field of view, and you
     probably will not have any success between 75
     and 155 if you haven't got it from 45 to 75.
     If you do find that you can see the comet somewhere between 45 and 75 or 80 degrees, just note
     that roll angle and then if it's feasible we'd
     like you to photograph it after the LM entry
     part of the checklist. Over.

_page : 135
_tape : Tape 31/7
_extra : 
CMP: Okay, Joe. Let me give it back to you and see
     if I've got it here. After the P52, during our
     PTC you want us to use P52 and observe Bennett's
     Comet through the sextant; note a roll angle if
     we can find it visible. It would be visible
     somewhere between - ideally between 45 and 75
     degrees, and we should lose it about 155 roll,
     and if we do see it, make an observation of
     whether it is photographable, note the roll
     angle for photographs to be taken after or
     prior to initiation of PTC at 56:30.

     I'm talking about the H<sub>2</sub> CRYO TANKS. We'd like
     the tank 1 HEATER to OFF; tank 2 to AUTO. Over.

[179409]

     configuration now. H<sub>2</sub> HEATERS 1, OFF; 2, AUTO.
     Both O<sub>2</sub> HEATERS are in AUTO.

[179423]
_page : 140
_tape : Tape 32/4
CC:  Okay. That's the configuration we want you in,
     and here's what we're thinking about. When we
     went to tank 1 AUTO, tank 2 OFF; we found that
     the heater cycle had a tank 1 pressure of about
     233 psi, which is well above the caution and
     warning limit, and if we go to that configuration
     for sleep, we'll keep from getting CAUTION AND
     WARNING lights during the sleep cycle. Okay.
     In order to do that comfortably, we want to spend
     the rest of the day using more H<sub>2</sub> out of tank
     number 2, so as to get an unbalance in favor of
     tank 1, so at the end of the sleep cycle it'll
     all come out even. And that's why we have you
     in tank 1 OFF, tank 2 AUTO, now. We expect to
     get about a 3-percent unbalance over the next
     10 hours; and prior to sleep, we'll call you to
     reverse the configuration again. Now the only
     disadvantage here is that, during tile day, you
     will probably get a few CAUTION AND WARNINGS,
     and we just figured it would be better to get
     them now than while you were sacked out. Over.

     for you, Jack; G&C tells us that the OPTICS
     jitter is very similar to what we had on

     supercritical helium pressure reach 1800 psi by
     103 hours, at which point we'd be within a possibility of rupturing the burst disk when you
     activate the DPS. Now, based on the pressure at

     6-1/2 psi per hour between then and now, the pressure

LMP: Okay. How do you read now, Joe? I'm going from
     OMNI C to D now.

[181866]
_page : 143
_tape : Tape 33/2
CC:  You're still loud and clear on - on D, Fred.
     Stand by 1.

[181874]
_page : 143
_tape : Tape 33/2
LMP: Okay. i'll put her back to OMNI B if you all
     want to take command again?

[181909]
_page : 143
_tape : Tape 33/2
LMP: And the last thing we heard, Joe, was that the
     SUPERCRIT should be reading about 710 psi.

[181916]
_page : 143
_tape : Tape 33/2
CC:  Okay. That's the last thing I passed up. And
     while we're waiting for INCO to decide here, let
     me continue. The deadband that is considered
     acceptable is between 660 and 770 psi. In other
     words, any rise time that'll give you one - a
     pressure between those two, will keep you below
     the critical pressure at 103 hours or so. So,
     we expect it to read in that - in that band and
     if it does, there will be no problem. If it
     reads between 770 and 800 psi, we will want you
     to check the pressure again at about 59 hours,
     and I'll get the detailed procedures in a minute.
     If the pressure is equal to or greater than
     800 psi, we're going to have to go into some more
     detailed procedures; we're going to try to - to
     get PCM data on it, for one thing. We may have
     to have you sit there and stare at the gage for
     a while to find out when it clicks up and get an
     accurate rise time on it, and then in extreme
     case, we are even thinking about a DPS burn, but
     we don't really think that will happen. Now, if
     you are ready to copy, what I have for you is a
     change or an addition to the LM Activation checklist 
     between pages TLC-1 and TLC-2, which consists
     of seven steps, and if you can find a blank side
     to write it down on, I would like to pass it up.
     Over.

[182024]
_page : 143
_tape : Tape 33/2
LMP: Okay. How do you read on OMNI C, now?

[182028]
_page : 143
_tape : Tape 33/2
CC:  Okay. You're loud and clesx on OMNI C. Stand by
     1 while we get INCO synced up.

[182040]
_page : 143
_tape : Tape 33/2
LMP: Okay. The rest of your update was that it's okay
     if it is anywhere between 660 and 770 psi. If
     it's above 770, you are going to ask us to consider going back in at 59 hours and either get
     PCM going or sit there and give you gage reading
     changes on the basis of that. And you said something 
     about an extreme measure. We may have to
     consider some sort of DPS maneuver.

[182085]
_page : 144
_tape : Tape 33/3
CC:  That's correct, Pred. We don't have procedures
     for that yet, and we don't have any real expectation of getting into it. The procedure I'd like
     to read up to you now is simply the steps required
     to get the supereritical helium pressure reading
     at 55 hours. Over.

     Houston. Select OMNI Bravo, please.

[182228]
_page : 144
_tape : Tape 33/3
LMP: Okay, Joe. I've created a new page here called
     TLC-1A, item 6, Transfer to LM power and the usual
     check that the floodlight's blank and that I 'ye
     got the CAUTION WARNING POWER light ON; I get a
     GET from Jack, and I will pass that on down to
     you. Item 7, CIRCUIT BREAKER EPS TRANSLUNAR BUS
     TIE, panels 11 and 16, CLOSED. Step 8, circuit
     breaker lighting and utility on panel 1, CLOSED,
     and turn on the utility lights. However, the
     lighting is such that I don't really need those.
     They are in stowage, right now, I guess, in the
     ISA, and I'll probably Just leave them there.

[182268]
_page : 144
_tape : Tape 33/3
CC:  Okay. That's optional. The way we had page
     TLC-1A written, that was all part of step 6.
     You haven't even gotten to step 7 yet. Step 7
     is as follows.

_tape : Tape 33/4
LMP: I'm going to stay OMNI B, if you all want to take
     command back and you can let INCO jockey them
     around between B and D. And how many steps we
     got, so I know whether to write big or small here,
     Joe?

[182441]
_page : 145
_tape : Tape 33/4
CC:  Okay. We got steps 6 through 12, but step 7 is
     the same size as 6, and 8 through 12 are short.
     They're only one line each.

LMP: Hello, Houston; 13.

[182695]
_page : 145
_tape : Tape 33/4
CC:  13, Houston. Go ahead.

[182700]
_page : 145
_tape : Tape 33/4
LMP: Okay, Joe. The last thing I got was HELIUM
     MONITOR to SUPERCRIT PRESSURE.

[182707]
_page : 146
_tape : Tape 33/5
CC:  Okay. The last part of step 7 is, "Report
     SUPERCRIT PRESSURE to MCC," and read back step 7.

[182730]
_page : 146
_tape : Tape 33/5
LMP: Okay. Step 7. Circuit breaker panel 11,
     AC BUS B, HELIUM PQGS DISPLAY, CLOSED. Main -
     Circuit breaker panel 11, AC BUS B, NUMERIC LIGHTING, 
     CLOSED. CD panel 11, AC BUS - Is that AC
     BUS B? BUS TIE INVERTER 1, CLOSED?

[182751]
_page : 146
_tape : Tape 33/5
CC:  That's affirmative.

[182753]
_page : 146
_tape : Tape 33/5
LMP: And CB - CB EPS INVERTER 1, panel 11, CLOSED.
     CB panel 16, INSTRUMENT SIGNAL SENSOR, CLOSED.
     INVERTER 1, SELECT. HELIUM MONITOR to SUPERCRIT
     PRESSURE. Report pressure to MSFN.

[182769]
_page : 146
_tape : Tape 33/5
CC:  Okay. That's correct. Now step 8 is, "On MCC
     request, perform step 9." In other words, you
     wait for us to decide what to do and that's
     according to the gouge we've already given you.
     And step 9, I'll give you now, is "HELIUM MONITOR
     to OFF, INVERTER to OFF." Over.

[182805]
_page : 146
_tape : Tape 33/5
LMP: Okay. Step 8 says, "Set in an MCC hold." Step 9
     says, "On MCC' s words, HELIUM MONITOR OFF, INVERTER OFF."

[182820]
_page : 146
_tape : Tape 33/5
CC:  Roger. That's correct. Step 10 is, "Configure
     circuit breaker panels per Activation 3 and 4."

[182844]
_page : 146
_tape : Tape 33/5
LMP: Okay. Configure - step 10, "Configure circuit
     breakers per Activation pages 3 and 4."

[182851]
_page : 146
_tape : Tape 33/5
CC:  Roger. That's correct. Step 11 is, "Deactivate
     the utility lights if you activated them," and
     step 12 which is the last one is, "Transfer to
     CSM power, usual observations, and report time to MCC."

[182900]
_page : 146
_tape : Tape 33/5
LMP: Okay. Step 11, "Deactivate utility lights."
     12, "Transfer to CSM power and note the usual
     observations and report the GET."

[182911]
_page : 146
_tape : Tape 33/5
CC:  Okay. That's it. And, of course, Houston will
     be requesting you to go to step 9 if the pressure
     is less than 770. If the pressure is between
     770 and 800, we will be asking you to do the
     following, if you're ready to copy.

[182939]

[183026]
_page : 147
_tape : Tape 33/6
CC:  Roger. We'll hold off on that. It was a short
     three-step procedure which said, "Repeat activation pages 
     1, 1A, and 2, "but there was another
     step in it that nobody understands. So, essentially what 
     we'd recommend in that ease would be
     that you would repeat the procedure that we just
     passed up for reading the SUPERCRIT pressure. If
     we need to, we'll clarify it later on. And that's
     all we've got.

[183056]

     again. All the stuff that normally was going to
     start at 57 hours, which the first item was pressurize CSM to 5.7 psia, we're going to move that
     up to 64 now, so we have our LM entry which was
     nominally at 58 at 55. Is that correct?

     at slightly more frequent intervals than had been
     planned, and the first time is now, and we will

     went up now to about - oh, I'd say a little less

     We tried to switch to AUTO track or REACQ, and
     it - yaw drives around from 270 to 0. And pitch
     goes from about 6 degrees around to 90. I'm
     trying - we're fitting it manual now at the
     angles that you gave us, and I'll try and get
     you in medium and narrow beam widths picking it
     up manually here.

CDR: Roger, Houston. What we plan to do for you
     today is start out in the space shipper [sic]
     Odyssey, and take you on through from Odyssey
     in through the tunnel into Aquarius. And show
     you a little bit of the landing vehicle, and
     your TV operator is now resting on the center
     couch, looking at Fred Haise, whose head is now
     Just about at the beginning of the tunnel, and
     his back is against the lower-equipment-bay
     optical area. And Fred will now transport himself into the tunnel, and into the spaceship
     Aquarius.

[198948]
_page : 159
_tape : Tape 36/5
LMP: You know one thing I noted, Jack, when I first
     came across here, that starting upright in the
     command module and heading down in Aquarius,
     there's a little bit of an orientation change
     that, even though I'd been through it once in
     the water tank, it still pretty unusual. I
     find myself, now, standing with my head on the
     floor when I get down inside the LM.

[198985]
_page : 159
_tape : Tape 36/5
CC:  That's a great picture, Jim. You got the light
     just right.

[199000]
_page : 159
_tape : Tape 36/5
LMP: And one of the nice things, Jack, particularly
     for a novice like myself, is the - the ease of
     moving around in here. It's, of course, as you
     know from working in the command module simulator,
     it's really quite a boon to have zero gravity
     as an aid. Because you get - pretty confining,
     really, at one g, to move around very much in
     there, and it's quite easy in this environment.
     The LM, as you can see, it looked pretty clean,
     I found a couple of loose washers about it and
     the - a little plastic cap off the sequence
     camera had come loose and I found it lodged over
     by the ED panel. Okay. Right under Jim, now,
     he's actually standing on a - what looks to be
     a can here. And, for the sake of all the people
     back there, housed inside this can is the - the
     LM ascent engine where, hopefully, you can see
     my hand resting on top of right now - the engine
     that we use to get off of the Moon. Immediately
     adjacent to the engine cover here, I have my
     hand on a white box now, which has been shown
     before. This happens to be Jim's PLSS, or the
     backpack which'll supply oxygen and water for
     cooling while on the lunar surface. This device
     we hope to make use of for - a planned 4 hours and
     possibly up to as much as 5 hours. Right - right
     behind the PLSS, a couple of little square packages I now have my hand on here, one here and
     one right below, are our OPSs, which are, in
     essence, the emergency oxygen supplies, which
     are good for some 40 to 45 minutes. These are 
     when we get ready to mount up and head outside,
     will be placed up on top of the PLSS.

[199164]
_page : 159
_tape : Tape 36/5
LMP: The second backpack is mounted down on the LM
     floor, I hope, positioned right between the two
     of us. I have my hand on it at this time.

[199391]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, and we see Fred looking in the vacuum
     cleaner there now.

[199402]
_page : 161
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, what I have out now, Jack, is LEVVA, which
     has also been shown before. It's a head garment
     for wearing out on the surface, and I - I'm
     bringing Jim's out here to show a couple of MODs.
     One problem before is that the cast of characters
     down on the surface haven't been able to be distinguished apart very well. So, not only Jim's
     suit has some red stripes on it, but as you can
     see his LEVVA also has a - a red stripe. And
     now you can see one other MOD here too, Jack,
     which I hadn't really seen myself before. I
     guess on 12, Pete and A1 had commented about
     the - commented about having trouble with sunlight in the eyes, so on our LEWAs they put on
     a new center section which you can pull down
     and use sort of like a baseball cap.

[199496]
_page : 161

     am I blocking out too much of the sunlight?

[199526]
_page : 161

     of the LEVVA there, and it's coming through loud
     and clear.

LMP: Okay.

[199554]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Jack, while Fred is putting away my helmet,
     you are looking over into Fred's station now.
     How's this picture, is it okay before - or do I
     have to adjust it?

[199566]
_page : 161

     PEAK but we recommend AVERAGE on the ALC if you
     haven't got it there already.

[199576]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CDR: We're in AVERAGE, Jack.

[199578]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. And we're getting a good picture of the
     LMP side with the DEDA over there.

[199589]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CMP: Hey, Jack, one question on the command module
     here. Do I - I have the DAP right now wide deadband. 
     Do you want me to begin setting up nar
     deadband and nulling the rates to start PTC

[199607]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CC:  Stand by, Jack.

[199651]
_page : 162
_tape : 
LMP: What I'm fishing out now, Jack, is another new
     piece of hardware that we are taking along this
     time as a result of some comments made on the Apollo 12 flight.

[199672]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CDR: What Fred is opening up - is a drink bag
     that we place inside of our neckring that will
     allow us to drink while we are on the lullar surface. 
     They - Pete and A1 - did not have that on
     Apollo 12 and they, consequently, got very
     thirsty. But we hope to alleviate that situation
     by having our own little bag of water which, with
     very little effort, we can have a sip or two
     while we are looking around and doing our geology work.

[199713]
_page : 162
_tape : 
LMP: So if you hear any funny noises, it is just
     probably the drink bag.

[199730]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CDR: Fred, the bag's empty.

[199756]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CDR: Fred is now looking through our optical device.
     It's an instrument in which to aline our platform, 
     and Fred is now looking into it just to
     see what kind of an outside picture he might
     be able to get. We might be able to use a TV
     camera to look through our optical instrument
     to the outside of the command module. A few
     minutes ago while we first came in, we did
     manage to look to the outside of the side hatch
     of the command module through our optical instrument. 
     Stand by. We'll try to see what we can do here.

[199789]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, Jim. Break, Jack, we'd like you to
     stay in the deadband you are now in, and we'll
     make a change when the TV is over. Another
     thing we would like you to do is check your
     pitch and yaw on your high gain meter so we can
     compare it with what we're seeing down here.

[199811]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, it's showing about - say 28 degrees and 267.

[199818]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
CC:  20 and 267.

[199821]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
CMP: 28 - 28 and 267.

[199845]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
LMP: Okay, Jack, have you got that picture now?

[199849]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
CC:  Fred, about one-quarter of our screen is lighted
     and it's impossible to determine what you are
     looking at right now. Maybe you could give us a
     little verbal description.

[199862]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
LMP: Okay. It's looking through the AOT in position 4,
     right rear. And we're looking back toward the -
     over the side hatch at the aft side of the service module.

[199888]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
LMP: Okay. Is - is it too dark a picture, Jack? You
     think the f-stop open may help?

[199894]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
CC:  No, Fred, it's got to be centered up a little
     bit. That's primarily what you have to do.

[199903]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
CDR: Jack, we can't center it up any more, because
     the side hatch is only one part of the AOT. The
     rest of that blackness you see is really space.

[199931]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
LMP: Okay. We'll try another one, and it's a little
     better centered. In fact, the only other one we
     have that shows the whole picture. We're in the
     forward D-10 of the AOT now, position 2, and you
     should be seeing something familiar like a radar
     antenna.

[199961]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
CC:  Okay, we see you moving the camera up to the AOT
     lens, and we got a real good picture now.

[199983]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
CDR: And -

[200003]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
LMP: Okay, Jack, I'm looking out the right window now,
     and not too far off in the distance now, you can
     see the objective, and I'll zoom in on it here a
     little and see if it brings it in better.

[200037]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
LMP: And it's actually beginning to look a little
     bigger now. You can see quite distinctly some
     of the features with the naked eye. And so far,
     I guess I have to even agree with Jim that it's
     still looking pretty gray with white spots.

[200079]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
CC:  Okay, Fred. We're getting a good picture of your
     destination there.

[200104]
_page : 164
_tape : Tape 36/i0
CDR: Jack, you've been looking at the - at Fred's
     workshop now, and you can see the abort guidance
     computer. And over there on the - tucked away in
     his armrest, is our activation checklist, which
     we'll be using very shortly. Up on the top of
     the window, we have our camera already mounted
     ready for photographing the descent. And now
     Fred's engaged in his favorite pastime, I found
     out on this flight so far.

[200147]
_page : 164
_tape : Tape 36/i0
CC:  He's not in the food locker, is he?

[200152]
_page : 164
_tape : Tape 36/i0
CDR: That's his second favorite pastime. He's rigging
     his hammock for sleep on the lunar surface now
     to find out - to see what it's going to be like.

[200163]
_page : 164
_tape : Tape 36/i0
CC:  Roger. Sleeping and then eating.

[200189]
_page : 164
_tape : Tape 36/i0
LMP: It's kind of difficult here, Jack, getting into
     a hammock in zero g. I'm not sure if I keep
     floating away from it or it keeps moving away from me.

[200210]
_page : 164
_tape : Tape 36/i0
CDR: If you notice a few things floating around, we
     found just about one or two washers occasionally.

[200217]
_page : 164
_tape : Tape 36/i0
LMP: And for the benefit of those that may wonder
     where Jim sleeps. Be a little difficult to rig
     his hammock in here right now with the hatch open,
     but his runs laterally in this direction, fore
     aft. So he has the upper berth and I get the
     lower berth.

[200254]
_page : 164
_tape : Tape 36/i0
CDR: And now while Fred's taking his hammock down and
     restowing it, I might give you some idea of what
     sort of confusion of attitudes since there is no
     up or down, and I 'm situated on top of the ascent
     engine just at the entrance to the tunnel. I'll
     reverse the camera 180 degrees and go from Fred,
     look through the tunnel again back at Odyssey,
     and we might pick up part of Jack.

[200305]
_page : 164
_tape : Tape 36/i0
CC:  There he is. We see him.

[200336]
_page : 164
_tape : Tape 36/i0
CDR: Okay, Houston. For the benefit of the television
     viewers, we've just about completed our little
     inspection of Aquarius, and now we're proceeding
     through the hatchy-gap into the tunnel and going
     back toward the Odyssey.

[200362]
_page : 164
_tape : Tape 36/i0
CC:  Okay, Jim. It's been a great show so far.

[200420]
_page : 165
_tape : Tape 36/11
CDR: And finally, Jack's let me back into the Odyssey as we
     slide on through the tunnel here

[200474]
_page : 165
_tape : Tape 36/11
CDR: Houston, 13. Are you still on TV?

[200477]
_page : 165
_tape : Tape 36/11
CC:  Yes, we sure are. We've got a good picture of
     the skipper there.

[200482]
_page : 165
_tape : Tape 36/11
CDR: Okay. What we can show you now, a little added
     benefit, we've got the drogue on Fred's couch
     in the command module right now. We stowed it
     temporarily while we're checking out the - out
     Aquarius and underneath his couch, we've got the
     probes stowed. Quite a big cumbersome device,
     and we'll get a shot of it for you.

[200533]
_page : 165
_tape : Tape 36/11
CDR: You're looking now at our probe, the place on
     the nose of Odyssey. It's a very heavy thing
     but I suppose in zero gravity it weighs nothing,
     and it's much easier to move around. As a matter
     of fact, both Fred and Jack commented, as many
     people in the past have, of how much bigger the
     spacecraft appears in actual flight when you have
     such ease in moving compared to our simulator
     which make training rather difficult.

[200578]
_page : 165
_tape : Tape 36/11
CC:  Okay. We're seeing a good picture of the probe
     there, Jim, and looks like the characters shaved
     before the show this time.

[200590]
_page : 165
_tape : Tape 36/11
CDR: Well, Fred said he had to keep up his TV image.

[200597]
_page : 165
_tape : Tape 36/11
LMP: Yes. That may be my first and last time though,
     Jack.

[200601]
_page : 165
_tape : Tape 36/11
CDR: It took Fred 1 hour to shave.

[200617]
_page : 165
_tape : Tape 36/11
CDR: We might give you a quick - a quick shot of our
     entertainment on board the spacecraft, which
     has been keeping us company for some time.

[200655]
_page : 165
_tape : Tape 36/11
CDR: This little tape recorder has been a big
     benefit - has been a big benefit to us in passing some of our time away on our transit to the
     Moon, and it's rather odd to see it floating like
     this in Odyssey while it's playing the theme from
     "2001." And, of course, the tapes wouldn't be
     complete without "Aquarius."

[200708]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
CC:  Okay, Jim. We're seeing the tape recorder now,
     and just - by the way, how long do you expect to
     keep the TV on this evening?

[200718]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
CDR: Well, when we - Stand by 1.

[200725]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
LMP: Yes, I got them with the cabin repress valve
     again there, Jack.

[200729]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
CDR: Every time he does that our hearts - our hearts
     jump in our mouth. And, Jack, any time you want
     to terminate TV, we're all set to go.

[200761]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
CC:  Okay, Jim. It's been a real good TV show. We
     think we ought to conclude it from here now.
     What do you think?

[200771]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
CDR: Roger. Sounds good. And this is the crew of
     Apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening,
     and we're just about ready to close out our inspection 
     of Aquarius and get back for a pleasant
     evening in Odyssey. Good night.

[200790]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
CC:  Thank you, 13.

[200920]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. The next thing we'd like you
     to do is to -

_tape : Tape 36/12
CMP: Go ahead.

[200926]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
CC:  - - we'd like you to roll right to 060 and null
     your rates for photography of the Comet Bennett.
     To do that, we would like you to enable quads C
     and D. For the maneuver, use all your quads.
     And in precisely 1 minute, we'd like you to terminate the battery charge on battery B. One
     other request, we'd like to have you verify - -

[200952]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
CMP: Okay. Will do.

[200954]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
CC:  One other request, we'd like you to verify your
     high gain configuration. We'd like to know what
     track mode, what SERV0, and what beam width.

[200965]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
CMP: Okay, Jack, during the TV, we were AUTO TRACK,
     NARROW BEAM WIDTH, and the PRIMARY ELECTRONICS.
     And we had a good lockup. Just after we started
     the maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get
     real good signal strength, and it just seemed
     that right there at about 239 degrees in yaw,
     that the signal strength would just drop off and
     yaw would go to zero and pitch would go to 90.

[201005]
_page : 167
_tape : Tape 36/13
CC:  Roger. We copy, and the TV show was great.

[201012]
_page : 167
_tape : Tape 36/13

     to 060, 090, and 0.

[201031]
_page : 167
_tape : Tape 36/13
CC: And, 13, we'd like you to check C-4 thruster.

[201093]
_page : 167
_tape : Tape 36/13
CMP: Okay, Jack. The battery charge has been terminated 
     on the battery B.

[201098]
_page : 167
_tape : Tape 36/13
CC:  Roger. We see it, Jack. And we got a reading
     of minus 2 degrees on the docking index. We'd
     like to know it that's 2.0 precise or if it's 2.1 or 1.9.

[201114]
_page : 167
_tape : Tape 36/13
CMP: No. It's a minus 2.0 precisely.

CC: 13, we've got one more item for you, when you
     get a chance. We'd like you to stir up your
     cryo tanks. In addition, I have shaft and trunnion - -

[201187]
_page : 167

[201370]
_page : 167
_tape : Tape 36/13
LMP: Okay. Right now, Houston, the voltage is - is
     looking good. And we had a pretty large bang
     associated with the CAUTION AND WARNING there.
     And as I recall, MAIN B was the one that had had
     au amp spike on it once before.

     trying to come up with some good ideas here for you.

[201809]
_page : 169
_tape : Tape 36/15

[201822]
_page : 169

[214979]
_page : 212
_tape : 40/13
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. And down here we're getting regrouped, trying to work on your control modes and
     trying to set up something for PTC and taking a
     look at consumables as opposed to flight plan,
     and so forth, and as soon as we get all that information, we'll pass it up to you. We also have
     the 14 backup crew over in the simulators looking
     at dock burns and also trying to see what kind of
     alinement procedures they can come up with for
     looking at stars out the window. So if you ever
     are able to see any stars out there and think you
     can do an alinement out the window, why let us
     know.

[215020]
_page : 212
_tape : 40/13
CDR: Okay. Jack, right now we're not able to. The
     sunlight's reflecting off the thrusters and whatever debris came away at the time of the mishap
     is still with us, such that the stars are hard
     to find, and why - what respect do you want us to
     do the stars out the window - Just to check the
     LMS run, is that correct?

[215044]
_page : 212
_tape : 40/13
CC:  That's affirmative. We'd like to correlate the
     information we get with your's, so that if we can
     use it to update the platform, we can. What we're
     really trying to do, Jim, is see if we can do a
     COAS aline so we can power down the platform.

[215123]

LMP: He's looking now.

[216329]
_page : 214

     out the window in that attitude.

[216348]
_page : 214
_tape : 40/15

CC:  The reason that we think that that would work

     us and the Sun.

[217374]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CDR: Okay, we're reading you loud and clear, Jack.
     I hope it stays this time.

[217378]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CC:  Okay. We'd like to brief you on what our plan
     is. We're, at this time, water critical in the
     LM. So we'd like to use as little as possible.
     To do this, we're going to plan to make a free-return maneuver of 16 feet per second at 61 hours,
     which is 37 minutes from now. Then we're going
     to power down the PGNS, and then we'll - at
     79 hours, we'll go ahead and make another abort
     maneuver to kick what we got. But we'd like to
     get that PGNS powered down as soon as possible.
     That would be after the midcourse and - so how
     do you feel about making a 16-foot-per-second
     burn in 37 minutes?

[217429]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CDR: Well, we'll give it a try, Jack, if that's all
     we've got. That's a 16-foot-per-second DPS burn
     in 37 minutes?

[217437]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CC:  Roger. We're working up a pad for it, but we'd
     want to know what you think about doing it at
     that time.

[217448]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CDR: Well, we'll do it. Could you give us a little
     bit more time?

[217470]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CC:  Okay, Jim. We'd like to get a suggested time
     from you. We can figure out a free-return
     maneuver for any time you want to give us, so
     if you'll give us the time you'd like to shoot
     for, we'll figure out a pad.

[217487]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CDR: Okay, that sounds good. I think if we have a
     little bit more time; we want to do it right.
     Stand by 1.

[217504]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1

     that.

[217515]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2

     That's an hour and 5 from now.

[217524]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CDR: Okay. We'll do it and we want to be sure we talk
     back and forth now to make sure we get this burn
     off right.

[217531]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CC:  Affirm.

[217535]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
LMP: Okay, in the interim, Jack, I looked around again
     and I saw that we have a radar and a landing-radar heater breaker in. Can I pull those out?

[217546]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CC:  Affirmative. Pull them both out.

[217552]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CC:  And now we want to ask you a question about
     alinements, and so forth. We wanted to know if
     you can see any stars out of the AOT. We also
     wanted to know if you could use the service
     module to cast a shadow on the LM windows and
     then look out the windows to see stars for a
     PS1 COAS alinement.

[217574]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CDR: Okay, in this attitude, Jack, that we're pitching
     around, I cannot use the AOT to see stars. We -
     we're just not able to see them at all. Now we
     may be able to maneuver off in yaw or - and/or
     roll and see stars. Right now, we haven't been
     able to. The AOT is useless. The command module
     structure is just radiating too much light into
     the - into the telescope.

[217601]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CC:  Okay, and how about using the service module to
     cast a shadow on the commander's window? If you
     do that, can you see stars for a COAS alinement?

[217615]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CDR: We could give that a try, Jack, although I don't
     know how successful it will be. We tried to do
     it - The light shines off our quads which makes
     it difficult to see stars. We do have the Earth
     and the Moon, if that can be of assistance.

[217638]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
_extra : 
LMP: Another problem - Right now, Jack, I'm looking
     out the right window and it's pretty dark out
     that window but there are about a thousand or
     so false stars out here from - left over from
     some of the debris. It's hard to discern what's
     real and not real.

[217658]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. That's good information and during the
     time that we see you're continuing to pitch, if
     you ever get in a position where you think the
     AOT might be of some use, we'd like you to
     periodically look out of it and see if you can
     see some stars that would enable us to get a P52.

[217679]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, will do. And also, let me ask you a question. In this configuration, docked, we have to
     use the TTCA to control pitch and roll. And,
     just how much can we use that without really
     changing our trajectory? We only have 60 miles
     to play with.

[217701]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, we'll put that to them.

[217725]
_page : 218

     the AGS or should I concern myself with the ATCA
     breaker?

[218774]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
CC:  Negative on the AGS. However, Fred, we need the
     ATCA breaker in.

[218788]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
LMP: Okay. ATCA breakers IN. Yes. I guess for the

[218850]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
LMP: Okay. Without suits, it doesn't do us much good
     either though.

[218872]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
LMP: Okay. And are we going to continue to be able
     to operate off the OMNIs, Jack. So can I leave
     the S-band antenna powered down?

[218898]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CC:  Okay, Fred-o. We don't plan to use the steerable
     antenna, although we want to leave the heaters on.
     So it looks you ought to open up COMM S-BAND
     ANTENNA, but leave S-BAND ANTENNA HEATERS closed.

[218913]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
LMP: Roger. COMM S-BAND is OPEN, S-BAND HEATER breaker
     is still CLOSED.

_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
LMP: And, on the bottom row, Jack, I'm going to leave
     the HEATER DISPLAY breaker out, which we had
     pulled before, and EPS DISPLAY. But I question,
     do we want the ASCENT ECA breaker in, as
     prescribed?

_tape : 41/8
CC:  That's affirmative.

[219023]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CDR: Okay. And, Jack, will you give us that - how
     about the ORDEAL breaker? Can I pull that?
     We don't need that, do we?

_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
CC:  And, Aquarius, tests in the simulator just showed
     that if you want to let the PGNS DAP hold your
     attitude for you, it will.

[219136]
_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
CDR: Okay, very well.

CC:  Okay, we're looking at it, Aquarius. We're
     ready to proceed with the test.

[220046]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
LMP: Okay, we're proceeding.

[220072]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
LMP: Okay, and Houston, you - you're looking at the
     weights now. Those are still good, right?

[220081]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
_extra : 
CC:  You're GO on the weights.

[220145]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to recycle on
     the DAP load and change your DAP to 32021. Over.

[220265]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're looking at your gimbal
     and we notice that we got a four-jet ullage
     loaded in the DAP and we gave you two jets on
     the pad. But, let's go with what we've got loaded.
     It'll be a four-jet ullage.

[220278]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
LMP: Okay.

[220300]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
LMP: Okay, Houston. How does the GDAs look now?

[220305]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  The GDAs are GO as they are. Press on.

[220329]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CDR: Okay, Houston, we're going to do the DPS
     pressurization and checkout.

[220336]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Stand by 1.

[220354]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Okay, your gimbals are within 0.3 and we're ready
     for the DPS pressurization and checkout.

[220413]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
LMP: Okay, Houston, do you want to follow up on
     page 15 with RCS checkout? In essence, we've
     kind of already done that.

[220427]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  You're right, Aquarius. Let's delete the RCS
     checkout. And a DPS looks GO.

[220543]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CDR: Houston, we're going to do a PGNS AUTO maneuver
     to the attitude.

[220549]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Stand by on that. Aquarius, we recommend
     driving it around there manually with a TTCA.

[220558]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CDR: Okay, we'll have to use the TTCA. Roger.

[220870]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CDR: We're going to AUTO now, Houston, to try to damp
     the rates. We're at the attitude.

[220882]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Roger, Jim. We verify the attitude.

[220887]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CDR: Roger.

[221017]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
LMP: And, Houston, we'd like to confirm, do you
     want the VERB 65 ENTER in there?

[221025]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
_extra : 
CC:  Affirmative on the VERB 65.

[221029]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Okay.

[221052]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Okay, Jack. I got another question on page 18.
     At 1 minute, I concur with MASTER ARM ON, but
     I wonder why I have to have the ABORT STAGE
     breaker in. We sure don't want any staging now.

[221078]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  Aquarius, delete the ABORT STAGE circuit breaker
     CLOSE. Leave it open.

[221086]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Roger. Will delete.

[221095]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Okay. Also, Jack, since we have four-jet ullage
     versus two, do you want - still want 10 seconds
     ullage or do you want 5 now?

[221109]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  Okay, Aquarius, we'll use automatic ullage.

[221118]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Okay. We'll just let the 7-1/2-second AUTO
     ullage do it.

[221123]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  Roger, and we'd like to do this in manual throttle,
     so on page 17 about two-thirds of the way down,
     THROTTLE CONTROL, MANUAL, vice AUTO.

[221135]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Okay. We're set to MANUAL.

[221158]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CDR: What's the 203 ... ?

[221165]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  ENTER on the 203, Jim.

[221171]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CDR: We've got 203 in the DSKY now and it looks as
     though it requires work, can we pass it?

[221176]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  Aquarius, ENTER on the 203.

[221182]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CDR: Wait a minute.

[221211]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  Aquarius, we'd like to verify that your throttle
     is in the MIN position.

[221218]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CDR: That's affirm.

[221220]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  And, in the event that you have to do a manual
     takeover, turn the ENGINE GIMBAL OFF, MODE CONTROL
     to ATTITUDE HOLD, and use the hand - use the TTCA.

[221236]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CDR: Roger.

[221294]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
_extra : 
LMP: Okay, 1 plus 30 to burn.

_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Roger.

[221325]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
LMP: Okay, MASTER ARM's ON; 1 minute.

[221333]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Roger, Aquarius. You're GO for the burn.

[221395]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CDR: 40 percent.

[221404]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15

[221425]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CDR: AUTO shutdown.

[221440]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
LMP: Okay. You're looking at 1685 now, Jack.

[221446]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Okay. You're GO in the residuals, proceed.

[221455]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
LMP: Okay. When you say GO on the residuals, you
     mean don't trim them. Is that right?

[221460]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  That's affirmative. No trim required.

[221466]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CDR: Roger.

[221468]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
LMP: Okay.

[221537]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Aquarius, check your MASTER ARM OFF, please.

[221564]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CDR: Okay, Houston. Burn's complete. Now we have to
     talk about powerdown, and what do you want us to
     do with the PGNS?

[221572]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Roger. We're looking at that right now, and
     you'll be the first one to get the word.

[221599]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CDR: And, Houston, it's doubtful right now whether
     we'll be able to see the stars in this configuration. The only way we could possibly get alinement is with the Earth and the terminator or the
     Moon and its terminator and I'd sure like to
     have you look at a powerdown - keeping the PGNS
     if at all possible.

[221629]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Roger, Jim. We'll get the word for you.

[221724]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CDR: And, Houston, we're in an ATT HOLD mode, can we
     turn off the buses?

[221740]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
_extra : 
CC:  Stand by on that one, Jim.

[221893]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're working on what's going
     to happen next. In the meantime, we'd like to
     take some high-power items off the line, so on
     panel 11, open DECA POWER, and open DECA GIMBAL.
     On 16, open the ATCA breaker.

[221916]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
LMP: Okay, on 11, we got DECA POWER, DECA GIMBAL, OPEN.
     On 16, we got the ATCA breaker OPEN.

[221977]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CDR: And, Houston, while you're thinking, see if you
     can come up with a procedure of perhaps using
     the command module optics with manual drive to
     perhaps look for stars.

[221991]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CC:  Roger.

[222084]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CDR: And, Jack, Aquarius. While you're thinking -
     before we had our COMM problems, we were wanting
     to know what to - whether we should hook up the
     side hatch urine dump system. So we wouldn't
     freeze up the normal urine dump system.

[222105]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CC:  Roger. We gave you a GO on that earlier. Sorry,
     you must have missed it. Use the side hatch for
     urine dump.

[222114]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CDR: Okay.

[222116]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CC:  And, how are the stars out the window now?

[222133]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CDR: Well, I'll look again, Jack, but at this attitude,
     the Sun is reflecting off of - off of quad 4 so
     bright that it's ruining any night vision and
     we still got particles floating around us; I'll
     have to take a long look and see if I can see
     any star patterns.

[222154]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CC:  Roger. And Aquarius, we're going to have to hand
     you over to a different site now, and we think
     maybe things will work better if this time we
     turn off the S-band transmitter/receiver, and
     bring it back up in 5 minutes. You copy?

[222179]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CDR: Okay. Stand by 1.

[222190]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CDR: Okay. I understand you want us to turn off the
     S-band transmitter/receiver and bring it up in
     5 minutes. Is that correct?

[222195]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
_extra : 
CC:  That's affirmative.

[222200]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
CDR: Tell us when.

[222222]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
CDR: And you want us to maintain attitude control.

[222226]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
CC:  Affirmative on the attitude control.

[222228]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
CDR: That's auto attitude control. Okay. You maintain auto attitude control.

[222236]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
LMP: Okay, Jack, I'm back on the line now. On the
     S-band, you want me to turn off the transmitter/
     receiver and the power amps are off for 5 minutes.
     Is that - when you give me the word - is that
     what you want?

[222250]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
CC:  Aquarius, leave the power amplifier the way it
     is. Turn the transmitter/receiver off for
     5 minutes. Now.

[222259]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
LMP: Okay. You tell me - you tell me when.

[222262]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
CC:  Okay. Turn it off now. See you in 5 minutes.

[222266]

[222764]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

[222772]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
LMP: Okay. You're loud and clear there, Jack.

[222774]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
CC:  Roger. Same here. We're - We're still discussing
     the next move.

[222784]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
LMP: I figured it. Let's just make it a good one.

[222798]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
CC:  We're looking real close at water usage profiles,
     and right now things are kind of swinging toward
     leaving the IMU powered up and powering down the
     LGC, but we'll have more word for you shortly.
     And we recommend for sleeping that you leave one
     guy on watch. We recommend you don't make any
     urine dumps if you can help it, because it'll
     make the debris problem worse than it is now.
     And we have some items that you might want to
     transfer to the LM, some towels, some penlights,
     fecal bags, UTS. And do you have any more items
     that we can help you out with at the moment?

[222857]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
LMP: Okay. Stand by on your latter list there, Jack.
     I understand no urine dumps. I guess we'll work
     through the UCD and all the bags we got; and
     real quick there, can you give a DAP load that
     we want in here now to conserve the RCS.

[222921]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
CC:  Okay. For attitude control coordinates, we're
     recommending manual control VERB 76 and watch
     your middle gimbal angle. Your DAP load that you
     have now looks good.

[222937]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
LMP: Okay. It's ATT HOLD VERB 76 for the guy on
     watch. And the DAP load we got right now is okay.

[223097]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
CC:  Aquarius, our decision for the time is to leave
     the IMU powered up, power down the LGC, and power
     down other nonessential items. We'll be coming
     up with a more precise checklist as soon as we
     can get it. Over.

[223116]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
LMP: Okay. The decision is to keep the platform,
     power down the computer, and we'll be standing
     by for further word on the powerdown, Jack.

[223173]
_page : 234

     136-mile perigee. Confirmed by Doppler.

[223187]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
LMP: Okay. 136-mile perigee now. That's very nice.

[223209]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
LMP: Oh, wait a minute, Jack. Did you say pericynthion
     or perigee?

[223213]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CC:  I meant pericynthion.

[223218]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
LMP: Ah. That's better.

[223519]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2

     circuit breaker, so if you want to update it for
     anything, let us know and we'll put it back in.

[223527]

LMP: Houston, do you read Apollo 13?

[224070]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CC:  This is Houston. Go ahead. Reading you weakly.

[224076]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CDR: Okay, Jack. We don't want to bug you, but you
     ought to be thinking - or what your thoughts are
     concerning what the next burn will be. I got to
     figure out a watch schedule and the sleep schedule
     and Just how we can meet the next maneuver.

[224095]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CC:  Roger. We're getting you a flight plan update.
     We're still computing on your next burn, and we're
     getting ready to give you a procedure for
     powerdown.

[224194]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CC:  Aquarius, one idea on managing the OMNI antennas.
     It might make it easier on everybody if we disabled
     the UPLINK SQUELCH and managed the antennas by
     switching when we hear the noise. Over.

[224218]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CDR: Roger. Will do.

[224767]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
_extra : 
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. Here's what we're going to do.
     We'd like you to point the LM X-axis either north
     or south. That's the positive X-axis. It appears
     to us that it would be closer to orient the LM
     plus X-axis toward the south. Do that with the
     LGC powered up using the TTCA. After that, we
     propose to power down the LGC to save some power.
     However, this means that we lose the use of the
     TTCA, and we'll have to control the spacecraft
     with the hand controller in the DIRECT mode.
     Request your - your position on these two items.

[224854]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

[224865]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CDR: Okay, Jack. Understand. You want us to point
     the LM X - plus X-axis to the south using the
     TTCAs with the LGC powered up. Then, by powering
     down the LGC, we'll lose a TTCA. I wasn't too
     successful in controlling the spacecraft in attitude only, but I might be able to keep it out
     of gimbal lock.

[224894]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. We'd keep your ball
     powered up and go to DIRECT on the hand controller.
     And maintain attitude in a DIRECT position.

[224919]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CDR: Okay. Understand; and do you want some sort of
     a PTC mode, Jack?

[224927]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  Affirmative. We'll take whatever PTC mode you
     can set up, Jim.

[224934]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CDR: Okay. And since you know our approximate attitude,
     how about Just getting me something to find you
     on the DSKY for a southerly plus X-direction.

[224944]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  Roger. Stand by 1.

[225035]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CDR: And one other question, Houston. When you say
     power down the DSKY or the LGC, do you mean going
     into 06 or multiple circuit breaker?

[225048]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  Stand by on powering down the DSKY, Jim. We'll
     give you the procedure for that. The procedure
     that we - -

[225057]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CDR: Okay.

[225058]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  - - the procedure that we have is listed in several
     places. It's in the Contingency checklist under
     "Power down" on page 1, second paragraph.

[225081]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
_extra : 
CC:  And we'll give you that word when we want you to
     do that. That's LGC only, not to power down the
     IMU. But we'd like to have you hold off on that
     until we send you the word. Over.

[225098]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
CDR: Understand.

[225237]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
CC:  And, Aquarius, while we're working on this, we
     have a proposed flight plan update for your working and resting cycles. And - You ready to copy?

[225254]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
LMP: Okay. Do you want me to write this in the flight
     plan, per se, Jack?

[225259]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
CC:  You can probably write it on a piece of scratch
     paper. This is pretty easy.

[225271]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
LMP: Okay. Go ahead. We got a lot of scratch paper.

[225279]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
CC:  Okay. We're suggesting that the LMP rest while
     the CMP and CDR are awake. LMP ought to hit the
     sack at about 63 hours, coming up in 25 minutes.
     And you get to rest for 6 hours. You get up at
     69 hours. At 70 hours, the commander and the
     command module pilot sleep for 6 hours until
     76 hours. Around 70 - 76-1/2 to 77 hours, we'll
     do a P51 and a 52. At 78:30, we'll load P30 and
     aline AGS to PGNS. Our ignition time for a second
     burn will be, presently, 79:25:26.5, and we'll
     have a pad for you shortly. We suggest that all
     of you eat after the burn. That'll be 81 to
     82 hours. Let the CMP and CDR eat while you are
     sleeping. And that you grab a bite as soon as
     you can. Over.

[225425]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
LMP: Okay, Jack. As I read that, the LMP is to go to
     sleep at 63:00 for about 6 hours. During that
     period, the CDR and CMP should try to get a bite
     to eat. I'm to awake at 69 hours. CDR and CMP
     sleep at 70 hours, and they are to awake at
     76 hours. And we should plan on doing our P51,
     P52 at 76 hours or 76:30. At 78:30, we're going
     to load a P30 and aline AGS to PGNS. Second
     maneuver is to take place at 79:25:26.5 for
     ignition time. Then we're all to eat at 81 to
     82 hours.

[225485]

_tape : 42/4
_extra : 
CC:  Okay. With a minor modification, your P51, P52
     will be about 77 hours, and that's the period of
     darkness. And the commander and the CMP ought to
     eat around 68 to 69 hours, and you should eat
     between 69 to 70 hours just after you get up. We
     have left an hour in there where everybody is
     awake together to talk things over. Go ahead.

[225524]

     done around 77 hours, while we're in darkness.

[225551]
_page : 237

     laid out for further on, which we can relay to you
     later.

_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
LMP: Okay.

[225580]
_page : 237

     attitude you want me to go to.

[225590]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5

     I'll get that for you, Jim.

[225596]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CDR: Okay.

[225703]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CC:  And, Aquarius, just to get you thinking in that
     direction, we've run a fairly thorough analysis,
     and we've found out that it's going to be cheaper
     to keep the LGC and the DSKY up and turn the
     inverter and the ball off. It's going to save us
     1 amp and also some water, so it looks like what
     we're going to do. And we'll have to monitor the
     middle gimbal angle. And we'll get the procedure
     on that, and it'll also be an easier control mode
     where we'll be able to use the TTCA through the -
     through the DAP.

[225737]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CDR: That sounds great, Jack.

[226048]

CDR: Ready to copy.

[226062]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
_extra : 
CC:  Okay. It's pretty easy. We see you've already
     got VERB 16 NOUN 20 called up there and so we
     want you to, in maneuver and PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD,
     use the TTCA. We want you to, on the commander's
     ball, pitch to 267.5 and yaw to minus 4.5. And
     when you do this in VERB 16 NOUN 20, on the DSKY,
     you ought to read plus 00120, plus 26750, and
     plus 00450. Go ahead.

[226114]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
LMP: Okay. We're to drive the commander's ball to a
     pitch of 267.5, yaw minus 4.5. And we should have
     in 16 20 at that time, plus 00120, plus 26750,
     plus 00450.

[226136]
_page : 238

_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CDR: Okay. We're just about there in pitch and in ...
     middle gimbal angle, but that other gimbal angle
     didn't look like it pulled the right way. I
     tried both methods.

[227042]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CC:  Yes. I been looking at that, too, and we're asking why, and we'll get an answer for you.

[227060]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
LMP: Yes. Houston, I wonder if you're accounting for
     being a bit off the bellyband here, and I've gone
     through GASTA.

[227078]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CC:  And, Fred-o, I know you're supposed to start
     sleeping here pretty soon, but we got a new PC

[227135]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
_extra : 
CC:  Okay, Fred. P30 maneuver purpose is PC plus 2,
     DPS to this time, we're going to the MPL. And
     NOUN 33, 079, 27, 4013, plus 08144, minus 00443,

     08455, 420, 268, 261, plus 08155, minus 00443,
     minus 02187, COAS is N/A. Your GDA ought to be
     okay as it is from the last burn, but pitch ought
     to be at 5.85; in roll, it's 6.74. Your ullage
     will be two jets for t0 seconds. Your DPS
     throttle will be 10 percent for 5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, and the remainder at full
     throttle. And for your information, this will
     put you in the water at 142 plus 47. Over.

[227266]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
LMP: Okay. DPS, pericynthion plus 2 into the MPL,

     N/A. GDA should be okay as is, which hopefully
     is pitch 5.85, yaw 6.74. Two-jet ullage for
     10 seconds, the DPS throttle 10 percent for
     5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, 100 percent for the rest of the burn. And this should
     put us into the water at 142 plus 47.

     DELTA-V<sub>Z</sub> is minus 02226. Read back.

[227362]
_page : 239

[227368]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
CC:  Okay. Good readback.

[227381]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
LMP: Somehow that didn't add up with the DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> to
     give a DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> of that magnitude. It seems like
     it'd been bigger.

[227392]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
CC:  Okay. We'll take another look at it, Fred.

[227549]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
CDR: Okay, Houston. I'm not having too much luck holding this particular attitude.

[227562]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
CC:  Okay, Jim. Stand by 1.

[227657]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. When you get her pretty much in
     attitude there, and it looks like you're as close
     as we need to be, we'd like to try a control mode
     and see if it will work; sort of a semi-PTC. We'll
     leave the ball powered up for this, and if this
     doesn't work, why, we'll have to revert to
     ATTITUDE HOLD mode. But - Stand by 1, please.

[227703]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
_extra : 
CC:  We'd like you to think about this control mode,
     Jim, and see if you think it might work from
     what you know right now. We're a little skeptical, but we'd like to put it to you. So, once
     you get in a pretty good attitude, monitor in
     VERB 16 NOUN 20, go to PGNS MINIMUM IMPULSE,
     VERB 76, as we have, and set up a yaw rate - yaw
     rate to the right. Monitor the middle gimbal on
     R<sub>3</sub> on the DSKY and see if she'll kind of stabilize
     out. If not, the only other suggestion we've got
     is to go to PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD. We'll keep the
     ball up until you make this evaluation.

[227745]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CDR: Okay, Houston. You cut out, say again.

[227751]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CC:  Okay. Where'd you lose me, Jim?

[227756]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CDR: I lost you when you said try the control mode;
     you're a little skeptical.

[227761]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CC:  Okay. From what you say, we have to be a little
     skeptical of this procedure, but we'd like to
     have you try it and have you evaluate it. You
     can monitor the middle gimbal on R<sub>3</sub>. Before we
     power down the ball, we want your evaluation.
     The next best choice is PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD. Over.

[227784]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CDR: Okay. I'll try it.

[227813]

[227920]
_page : 240

     You wanted me to try out control of the spacecraft in the PULSE mode. Is that correct?

[228063]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CC:  That's affirmative. Set up a yaw rate and monitor the middle gimbal angle.

[228076]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CDR: Okay. I can do that. I'm not too sure whether
     I can control roll or pitch in pulse, but I can
     control yaw in pulse - yaw in pulse on the ball.

[228090]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
_extra : 
CC:  Roger. And remember we're not going to have a
     ball there, so that we're going to be monitoring
     CDUs on the DSKY, and if we get it off, it will
     be pretty hard to figure out where to fly back
     to; and, well, in addition, have to control the
     OMNIs while we're doing this.

     for control of the - angles.

[228132]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CC:  Affirmative. You'll have the TTCA for pitch and
     roll.

[228138]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: Okay. I think I can do that without the ball,
     and if you Just give me the TTCAs I think I can
     control the spacecraft using 16 20.

     look at it as soon as it comes up.

[228292]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're going to dispense with
     this control mode. We'd like you to fly the
     machine back to the original attitude that you
     had, and we'll go PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD, and then
     we've got to get that ball off the line to save
     some power. And then, in order to keep even
     heating, every 15 or 30 minutes, we'll give you
     a call to give us 90 or 180 degrees of roll -
     of yaw.

[228327]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: Okay. You want me to go back to original attitude.
     I'll be going back to it now.

[228516]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I'm flying it back over
     towards the initial angles you gave me of a pitch
     of 257. I'll get near the bellyband in roll and
     yaw; then I'll go to PGNS ATT HOLD.

[228527]
_page : 242

[228786]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CC:  Okay. We'll buy what you've got on the DSKY
     there, and we'd just like to go through an
     overall powerdown procedure, and in so doing
     we'll catch the ball and inverter and it will
     only take a few minutes. So are you ready to
     start on panel 11?

     and the PQGS and ASC He REG are open.

[229098]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4

[229345]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CC:  Okay, Jim. Looks like what we have to do is - In
     order to maintain even heating, we just have to
     yaw the whole machine about 90 degrees per hour
     in increments. So we'll give you a call when it's
     time to yaw 90 degrees.

[229384]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5

CC:  Okay, Jim. Your present configuration has
     the following features. We got the electrical
     BUSES cross tied through the BAL LOAD circuit
     breakers, and we have AUTO CABIN REPRESS. One
     thing we'd like to do right now is to give you
     an uplink, so immediately we have to, on panel 11,
     close the UPDATA LINK circuit breaker. Go to
     P00 and DATA. Over.

[229492]

[229742]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CC:  Jim, I passed that newest pad that we have to
     Fred about 30 minutes ago. That's our latest.
     It's PC plus 2, and it begins with NOUN 33 of

     that one?

[229765]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CDR: Okay. We've got that one. What kind of a ATT
     HOLD MODE do you want us to do? Do you want us
     to do WIDE DEADBAND? I didn't ... on the DAP.

[229780]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CC:  Jim, the deadband is good the way it is. It's
     5 degrees, if you want to stay in it. And stay
     in the PGNS ATT HOLD mode.

[229789]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CDR: Okay.

[229833]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CC:  Two things, Jim. We want you to know that there's
     some pretty big attitude errors in, so if you go
     to AUTO, the computer is going to try to crank
     you around, and the other thing is don't drink
     water out of the LM.

[229854]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CDR: Okay. You might think about this. You know we
     lost our oxygen pressure in the command module.

[229916]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CC:  Aquarius, we're finished with the uplink. The
     computer is yours, and you can open the UPDATA
     LINK circuit breaker.

[229938]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6

[230181]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CDR: One thought that might occur here is that if we
     have low descent water pressure, we might consider taking the PLSS water and fill it in reverse. If that works, you might look at a
     procedure for that.

[230194]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7

     a little.

[230232]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CC:  Okay, Jim. That's a good thought, and we've
     looked at that, and it looks like that's feasible.
     So if and when we need to do that, we will.

[230291]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CDR: And, something else, Jack. When it's time for
     me to make my 90-degree yaw, what I planned on
     doing was going to NOUN 76 hold and just pulse
     and yaw several times until the yaw start and hope
     that pitch and roll stay within the limit.

[230317]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CC:  Roger. It sounds like a good plan and you can
     use your TTCA in MIN IMPULSE to take care of
     pitch and roll.

[230327]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CDR: Okay.

[230421]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
_extra : 
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We see ASCENT O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2 building up again, so we'd like to use
     something out of it, so turn on ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank
     number 2 and turn off descent O<sub>2</sub>.

[230439]
_page : 248

CDR: Roger. Opening up ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2, and
     turning off descent.

[230581]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CC:  And, Aquarius, Houston. We're starting to think
     about CO<sub>2</sub> buildup up in the command module there
     so we've got a recommendation, and what we're
     recommending is that you take the commander's
     hoses in the LM and put a cap over the red return
     hose and then figure out a way to fasten those
     hoses so they blow up into the CSM by extending
     them up through the tunnel as far as possible.
     And we'll get some flow out the blue side,
     circulate up and around the command module and
     to keep the CO<sub>2</sub> level down.

[230623]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CDR: Roger. We're thinking of that too, and one
     problem is that the COMM is connected securely
     to the hose, so we've got to get the COMM.cable
     off somehow to get that - So we'll still have
     COMM down here in the LM and you have the hose
     up there.

[230710]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CDR: Houston, we're trying to extend that commander's
     hose by use of the vacuum hose.

[230722]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CC:  Sounds like a good plan if you can work that
     out, Jim.

[230818]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CC:  Aquarius, if you can shake Jack loose there,
     I've got a - some procedures for him to write
     down.

[230857]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CC:  Oh, it's about 12 - 15 lines. It's a matter of
     verifying some valves and so forth.

[230870]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[230873]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
_extra : 
CC:  Okay. We want you to go in when you can and
     verify the following valves and leave them as we
     outline here. REPRESS PACKAGE valve, off;
     EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE, off; DIRECT O<sub>2</sub>, off;
     DEMAND REG, off; both WATER ACCUMULATORS, off;
     MAIN REG A and B, open; WATER GLYCOL - correction - WATER and then GLYCOL TANK INLET and
     OUTLET, both. Now if you want to get some water,
     we recommend that you momentarily turn the SURGE
     TANK on to pressurize the system and then turn it
     off and take out water as required. Over.

[230973]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CC:  That's it, Jack. And another note on taking
     water; if you don't drain enough water so that - -

[230989]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CC:  Say again, Aquarius.

[230993]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CDR: That wasn't us, Jack.

[230998]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CC:  Okay. One more note on the water, Jack. If
     you don't bleed the pressure off when you -
     don't take enough water to bleed the pressure off
     completely, the pressure that's left on there is
     going to drain away in a period of 1 to 3 hours.
     So it's a small amount of oxygen, but we might
     as well save it. So if you want to eliminate
     that problem you could completely drain the pressure off by putting the water in a water bag and
     saving it that way.

[231036]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CMP: Okay. That's a good idea.

[231038]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CC:  So that's the end of my - -

[231039]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CMP: What I'll do - let me repeat - Okay. Let me
     repeat it all back to you. REPRESS PACKAGE VALVE,
     off; EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE, off; DIRECT O<sub>2</sub>,
     off; both the DEMAND REGs, off; both H<sub>2</sub>O ACCUMULATORS, WATER GLYCOL ACCUMULATORS, off; MAIN
     REG A and B, open; WATER and GLYCOL TANK INLET
     and OUTLET, open; for water, momentarily pressurize the SURGE TANK, take out water as required. You're recommending drain out all the
     water until I can't get any more water out of
     it in order to conserve the oxygen.

[231094]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9

     accumulators and not the glycol accumulator.

     powering down the power amplifier, if it works.
     And I'd like to read up the steps to you and

     POWER AMP to PRIME; step 5, panel 16, POWER AMP
     CIRCUIT BREAKER open; step 6, RANGE FUNCTION
     switch, off. Read those back to me, and then
     I'll have a remark.

     RANGE FUNCTION switch, off.

[233336]
_page : 251
_tape : 43/11
CC:  Okay. And the note says that you should be able
     to hear us. If we can't hear you in a couple of
     minutes, you should close the POWER AMP circuit
     breaker on panel 16, and we expect to save an
     amp or more on this. It should work in the present attitude. When we go to the new yaw attitude,
     we're thinking about powering up the steerable,
     leaving the POWER AMP off and, if we can get
     good COMM in that mode, we'll still save some
     power. So if you concur, why don't you go ahead.

[233384]
_page : 251

     to put the stars in the AOT, would be either
     number 2 or 4. The rendezvous radar antenna
     is now in the way. You might think of a procedure to get rid of it with minimum power
     and then we maybe we'll be able to see stars
     in a couple of minutes here in a lower detent.

[237108]
_page : 259
_tape : 44/7
CC:  Okay, Jim. I think I understood that the
     rendezvous radar antenna is in the way and you

     VOICE BACKUP COMM configuration, which is pulling
     the power amd circuit breaker and going to DOWN
     VOICE BACKUP. If we get into a COMM problem, all
     you have to do is reverse that configuration, and
     it should be good again. Over.

     want a procedure for powering the command module

     don't want to power up the command module before
     EI minus 2 hours. That doesn't mean we can't
     start our procedure a good deal before that,
     but we don't want to power it up much before
     EI minus 2. Over.

LMP: Okay, Joe, about 76 hours or so and I guess you
     misunderstood. My question was what was the GET
     way back when, when I first came across to the LM

     been living on the LM, now?

[250176]
_page : 272
_tape : 46/6
CC:  Okay, the time of transfer to LM power was
     57 hours, 11 minutes. For your information,
     we seem to be reasonably fat on power. In fact,
     we are looking at a procedure that we might
     recommend to you later on after the burn and so
     forth of powering up one of the command module
     main buses via the LM umbilical. This would
     enable us possibly to charge up the command
     module batteries. Over.

[250216]
_page : 272

     we'll let you know when we want to uplink. Okay.
     Under "AGS Activation and Self Test," perform
     the entire procedure. On page 13, under "AGS
     Aline," do step 1; under "DAP Set, Gimbal/

LMP: Okay. I'll catch up here. On page 12, you'll
     give us MSFN updates, some vectors, and a P30;
     and we're to do the entire "AGS Activation and
     Self Test." On page 13, we'll do the "AGS Align"
     and under "DAP Set, Gimbal/Throttle Test,"
     step 1, I've changed "THROTTLE CONTROL MANUAL"
     to "THROTTLE CONTROL AUTO."

[270463]
_page : 309
_tape : Tape 50/8
CC:  Good readback. Turning over to page 14, step 2,

     Over.

[270495]
_page : 309
_tape : Tape 50/8
LMP: Okay. On page 14, a VERB 48, DAP load, NOUN 46
     changed to 31021. I assume you will give us any
     updated weights if we need any, and after the
     NOUN 47, a "VERB 34, ENTER." So, I - you're
     saying our gimbals look all right.

[270515]
_page : 309
_tape : Tape 50/8
CC:  That's affirmative on the gimbals, Fred. Nothing
     else on page 14. Proceed to page 15, and under
     "RCS CHECKOUT," we'd like to scratch that wording
     and just say "Verify the following switches:
     GUIDANCE CONTROL, PGNS;" step 3 - correction -
     it's line 3, change "ATTITUDE CONTROL (3)" to
     "MODE CONTROL;" "MODE CONTROL (BOTH)" to "AUTO."
     Verify ACA PROP, LMP ENABLE; ACA/4 JET, LMP

     all on page 15. Over.

[270585]
_page : 309

     CMC - FREE." Over.

     forget the CSM maneuver.

[270695]
_page : 310
_tape : Tape 50/9
CC:  Okay. And you can forget the "APS Follow-up,"
     too. Okay, on page 17, perform all of the AGS
     entries and at 4 minutes, we got a change.
     First line, CB(16) INVERTER 3, CLOSE; line 2,
     scratch out "Select INVERTER 1." At - proceeding
     on down the page, after "ATTITUDE MONITOR," we' d
     like you to place the RATE SCALE to "25 degrees
     a second." Okay, proceeding on down four more
     lines to "BALANCE COUPLE," we'd like to turn
     "BALANCE COUPLE-OFF." That's to keep the
     upfiring jets off of the CSM, in case we have
     to damp any rates in AGS, though we don't think
     we will. Then perform the rest of that page as
     written. Over.

[270764]
_page : 310
_tape : Tape 50/9
LMP: Okay, on page 17. Do the AGS load at minus
     4 minutes; it's CB(11), INVERTER 2, CLOSE, and
     scratch "Select INVERTER 1." RATE SCALE changed
     to "25 degrees a second." "BALANCE COUPLE,"
     we'll turn "OFF;" and, incidentally, on the AGS
     dampen rates point, it brings up the discussion
     we'd had before, Charlie, on takeovers. You
     might discuss what it's going to cost us DELTA-V-wise, if we get a control problem, to just shut
     her off and it take 30 minutes to regroup for a
     good manual burn.

[270806]
_page : 310

_extra : 
CC:  Fred, we already got that story for you, pretty
     well in hand. We're reviewing it right now.
     And I'd like to defer that question until later
     on. Basically, we're just going to shut down
     and take what we got, and we got a midcourse
     of about - the maximum of 5 foot per second,
     anywhere in the burn to get back to free return.
     That - that's basically the story. We'll give
     you the mission rules for this burn momentarily.
     I'd like to proceed on to page 18, at minus
     1 minute, scratch "MASTER ARM - ON." Stand by.

[270847]
_page : 311

LMP: Okay. You got some special reason for that?

[270876]
_page : 311
_tape : Tape 50/10
CC:  Yes, sir. We like - In case we don't get a
     manual ON - I mean, an AUTO ON, we're going to
     back up using the abort stage in the descent-engine command override at ignition plus 1 second.
     Backing up to page 17, at minus 4 minutes, you
     read "CB(11) INVERTER 2," it should be "CB(16)
     INVERTER 2." Over.

_tape : Tape 50/10
CC:  Okay, back to page 18. We'll continue on as is
     at 30 seconds, 10 seconds, 7 seconds, minus
     5 seconds. At "ignition," no ignition and we'll
     add here, "no ignition, START pushbutton - push;

     OVERRIDE, ON." Over.

CC:  Okay, good readback, Fred-o. At plus 15 seconds,
     scratch "MASTER ARM - OFF;" and at - proceeding
     on down to "At Engine Cutoff," it's - after the
     "MODE CONTROL: PGNS to ATT HOLD," we'd like a
     "VERB 76," and the "Damp Excessive Rates Via
     the LM Y, Z Translation." Over.

[271008]
_page : 312
_tape : Tape 50/11
LMP: Okay, scratch "MASTER ARM - OFF" at plus 15, and
     "At Engine Cutoff" after "MODE CONTROL: PGNS -
     ATT HOLD," we want a "VERB 76 ENTER," and "Damp
     Excessive rates Via LM Y, Z translation." And
     a question on the - propellant quantity, we expect
     it to get down below 37 percent on this burn.
     Does that compare with that burn time when you
     get down to it.

[271036]
_page : 312
_tape : Tape 50/11
CC:  That's negative. At this - this burn, we're
     looking at - not reaching 37 percent, so I
     don't think wetll have to perform that step.
     We will verify that for you. Okay. One other
     statement: "At Engine Cutoff, if manual start,
     then at 30 feet per second to go, throttle to
     40 percent. At DELTA-V equals zero, stop push-button, push." Over.

[271091]
_page : 312
_tape : Tape 50/11
LMP: Okay, Charlie. If a manual start, that was
     throttle to 40 percent at - Was that 30 foot
     per second to go?

[271099]
_page : 312
_tape : Tape 50/11
CC:  That's affirmative. At 30 foot per second to go.

[271110]
_page : 312
_tape : Tape 50/11
LMP: Okay. Then it's stop pushbutton at VGO equals
     zero?

[271116]
_page : 312
_tape : Tape 50/11
CC:  That's affirmative. What we want to do, if we
     got a manual start, we're going to have to shut
     down manually, and, to get a better guided cut-off at 30 foot per second to go, we want you to
     throttle at 40 and acceleration is within reason
     there, and we feel like we can get a good manual
     cut-off. 0ver.

     attitude. And the third thing is we'd like to
     back out of this procedure we just put you into

_page : 344
_tape : Tape 53/4
LMP: Okay. Go ahead, Vance.

[286971]
_page : 344
_tape : Tape 53/4
CC:  Okay. After number 1, first line, cross out
     "And VHF-A." Second line, cross out "SIMPLEX
     operation." Third line, cross out "Prime."
     That refers to PRIME POWER AMP, OFF. That -
     that "PRIME" should actually be replaced by
     OFF. And that's the second prime that line.
     Also in the third line the last word "OFF"
     should be crossed out and replaced by "PCM."
     Fourth line is okay. Fifth line, which is
     "VHF VOICE, ON, OFF, OFF," cross out. "Lighting,
     FLOODS," which is the next line should be "OFF",
     but add the following, "Or OVERHEAD/FORWARD
     prefer OFF." Okay. Step 2 remains the same;
     no change for the moment. Stand by. Skip
     step 2. Do not do it. Just go on to step 3,
     which is "Configure circuit breakers per the
     chart." That takes us to page power 6. Why
     don't you give me a readback on what you had
     on power 5, Fred-o.

[287088]
_page : 344
_tape : Tape 53/4
LMP: Okay. On power 5, emergency powerdown. Item 1,
     first line, I scratch the "And VItF-A." Second
     line "SIMPLEX operation." Third line, I replace
     the second prime which is the POWER AMP with an
     "OFF," and the last word in that line is "OFF,"
     replaced it with "PCM." Fourth line is okay.
     Fifth line, I scratch the whole line. Lighting,
     we haven't needed floods yet so we will just leave
     them off, exterior lighting off. Scratch line 2
     and I am now on power 6, wait for your update on
     the CB panels.

[287131]
_page : 344
_tape : Tape 53/4
CC:  Okay. Power 6. Okay. Power 6 refers to panel 11.
     You should go per the chart with the exception of
     those breakers that I :all out. First line is
     okay. Or, let's say, first row. Second row,
     QUAD 4, TCA, closed; QUAD 3, TCA, closed; QUAD 2,
     TCA, closed; and QUAD L, TCA, closed. The rest
     of that row is okay. Row 3, about halfway over,
     ATCA (PGNS), closed. Okay. The rest of that
     line is okay. Fourth line, HEATER - stand by.
     Okay. That line is all okay with the exception
     of the last three circuit breakers, Fred, under
     PGNS, which is LGC DSKY, IMU STANDBY, IMU
     OPERATE. Those three should be closea, at least
     for the time being. And finally, the fifth line;
     it's okay as is. And would you give me a readback on that?

[287255]
_page : 345
_tape : Tape 53/5
LMP: Okay. I disagree on the fifth line. It appears
     that we ought to have the ASCENT ECA CONTROL
     open.

[287269]
_page : 345
_tape : Tape 53/5
CC:  Okay. We'll check into that one and while we
     are listening to the rest of your readout.

[287277]
_page : 345
_tape : Tape 53/5
LMP: Okay. And top row is correct as is. Second row
     we want the QUAD TCAs 1 through 4 closed. On the
     third row, we want the ATCA (PGNS), closed. On
     the fourth row we want the PGNS LGC DSKY, IMU
     STANDBY, IMU OPERATE, all closed, and you're
     saying the bottom row as is.

[287303]
_page : 345
_tape : Tape 53/5
CC:  Okay. We'll go along with what you said on the
     ASCENT ECA CONTROL. That should be open.

[287318]

_tape : Tape 53/5
CDR: Okay. Continue, Vance.

[287321]
_page : 345
_tape : Tape 53/5
CC:  Okay. Next page, power 7, panel 16. First row,
     close the four QUAD TCA circuit breakers, that is,
     QUAD 1, TCA; QUAD 2, QUAD 3, and QUAD 4 TCA. Okay.
     Rows 2, 3, and 4 are okay.

[287357]
_page : 345
_tape : Tape 53/5
LMP: Okay. Panel 16, top row, we want to close QUAD 1
     through 4 TCA breakers, and you're saying the other
     three rows are as is. Again, I have the exception
     the ASCENT ECA CONTROL on 16 should also be open.

[287375]
_page : 345
_tape : Tape 53/5

     keep it up now, do we?

[287787]
_page : 347
_tape : Tape 53/7
CC:  Okay, Fred. That's one that we're leaving up until
     the PTC is established. We have a procedure for
     PTC to try with you, which we're hopeful will work
     pretty well. And I'll read that up as soon as you
     get what you're doing now done.

[287803]

_page : 347
_tape : Tape 53/7
LMP: And one other question, Houston. You really want
     to pull the ASA breaker? You want to give up the AGS probably 
     for good now, huh?

[287859]
_page : 347
_tape : Tape 53/7
_extra : 
CC:  Okay. I'll get back with you on your cuestion
     in a minute, Fred. New, here comes the PTC
     procedure. Step 1, GUIDANCE CONTROL to PGNS;
     two MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD; VERB 76, ENTER;
     maneuver to PTC attitude; and that incidentally
     is roll 0, pitch 90, and present yaw. We realize
     you can't monitor that on your FDAI, but you can
     on a verb, with a VERB 16 NOUN 20.

[287900]
_page : 348
_tape : Tape 53/8
CC:  With me?

[287920]
_page : 348
_tape : Tape 53/8
CDR: Roger. GUIDANCE CONTROL, PGNS; MODE CONTROL, ATT
     HOLD, VERB 76, ENTER; maneuver to PTC attitude
     which is roll 0, pitch 90, and yaw, which is the
     present yaw. Is that correct?

[287934]
_page : 348
_tape : Tape 53/8
CC:  That's correct. Okay. Next. Mode - at - When
     you're established at the attitude, MODE CONTROL
     AUTO. Key in VERB 16 NOUN 20 to monitor rates;
     when less than 0.1 degree a second, rate in all -
     in each axis, then disable plus-X thrusters.
     Okay. Next VERB 25, NOUN 07, ENTER; 1257, ENTER;
     252, ENTER; 1, ENTER; VERB 77, ENTER; VERB 48,
     ENTER; put in the DAR 22110 and PROCEED; VERB 34,
     ENTER; then VERB 16, NOUN 20; and monitor rates.
     On rates less than 0.01 degrees per second in all
     axis: VERB 76, ENTER; MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD;
     then 30 clicks of right yaw to start the maneuver.
     Over.

[288108]
_page : 348
_tape : Tape 53/8
CDR: Okay, Vance. PTC procedure: GUIDANCE CONTROL,
     PGNS; MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD; VERB 76, ENTER;
     maneuver to PTC attitude; roll 0, pitch 90,
     yaw 0; my ball now, of course, is inoperative,
     so I'll have to get that on the DSKY. The 5 is
     MODE CONTROL, AUTO; 6: VERB 16, NOUN 20, monitor
     rates; rates less that 1 degree per secend in
     each axis, disable, and I didn't hear that last
     part. The next one was VERB 25, NOUN 07, ENTER;
     1257, ENTER; 252, ENTER; 1, ENTER; VERB 77, ENTER;
     VERB 48, ENTER; 22110, PROCEED; VERB 34, ENTER;
     VERB 16, NOUN 20, ENTEF; monitor rates. Rates less
     than 0.01 degrees per second in all axis. VERB 76,
     ENTER; MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD; then 30 clicks of
     right yaw to stop - to start - maneuvers

[288184]
_page : 348
_tape : Tape 53/8
CC:  Roger. That's correct, Jim. to answer your
     questions and correct one point, yaw should be 
     your present yaw, whatever it is, an
     with roll 0, pitch 90, present yaw. The other
     thing is, you said disable and you didn't hear
     the rest. That's disable plus-X thrusters. And.
     finally, near the end, the 22110 referred to
     DAP loading.

[288228]
_page : 349
_tape : Tape 53/9
CDR: Rogr. Now, to maneuver to PTC roll 0, pitch 90
     and yaw in - and pitch in here, roll is here.
     Yaw - whatever yaw we have in. Okay, Vance.
     In our initial maneuver to PTC attitude, I am going
     to have to use - to display 16 20 and I'll have
     to use the TTCA to get there.

[288301]
_page : 349
_tape : Tape 53/9
CC:  Jim, Roger. Your use of the TC - TTCA and just a
     reminder that in maneuvering that - that - that
     roll is in R<sub>3</sub> and yaw is in R<sub>1</sub>

[288317]
_page : 349
_tape : Tape 53/9
CDR: That's affirm. And I'm going to take out roll
     first to get it zero and then I'm going to take
     care of pitch.

[288324]

[288541]
_page : 349
_tape : Tape 53/9
CC:  Okay. A couple of things, Jim. One is that you
     can use the TTCAs to maaeuver, but you're going
     to save a lot of fuel if you'd try MINIMUM IMPULSE.
     So, that might be a better recommendation. The other
     thing is, we'd like to give you a GO before you disable 
     the plus-X thrusters, and before you do a
     VERB 76, and MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD. Over.

[288580]
_page : 349
_tape : Tape 53/9
CDR: Okay; understand. You want a GO before I - I'm -

_tape : Tape 53/9
CC:  Yes. All we wanted to io was take a look at things
     before you disabled the plus-X thrusters, and before

[288693]
_page : 350

     LiOH canisters to connect to your hoses - the
     outlet hoses in the LM so that, as time passes
     in the mission, you car continue scrubbing the.
     LM atmosphere. And this whole thing requires
     modifying a kit so that you can attach the hose
     modifying a LiOH canister, so you can attach the,
     hose to it. So, sometime in the future, we will
     be coming up to you wilh that procedure. Second

     set up, the first part of the procedure?

[289699]
_page : 353
_tape : Tape 53/13
CDR: Well, Vance, I've been trying to use MINIMUM
     IMPULSE only attitude control to get my roll
     and yaw - the roll and pitch, rather. But, with
     the attitude control only in this configuration,
     I - I can't command these - the roll the way I
     want to. So, I had to go to TTCA to get my roll
     to build up towards zero, it was going - decreasing
     towards 270. I really don't know what the combination 
     is in the attitude control, that you can get
     the control to pitch ard roll the way you want it
     to. You've got to use the TTCA.

     going toward the designated amounts, now passing
     through 23 degrees in pitch, and I'm going up
     past 321 degrees in roll. And I am letting go
     that direction and when I get there, 90 in pitch

     switch over at this time to your other canister.
     Second point, it might help in setting up this
     PTC if you concentrate on roll first, and get
     that going; and then work on pitch, when roll is
     established, and sort of take whatever yaw you get.

     after that,

     wire or the gray tape?

[290271]
_page : 355
_tape : Tape 54/2
CC:  That's affirm. We have a lengthy procedure here;
     but, in short, you use plastic as a covering for
     the whole thing. You put some kind of a stiffener
     at the top so the plastic doesn't suck against
     the LOI - LiOH enter - entrance side. You'll -
     You need gray tape to stick the whole thing together, 
     and you need something like a sock to
     put in the - the bottom so that the outlet side
     is plugged up. As it turns out, the flow is
     rather U-shaped througt the cartridge, Fred. It,
     if you plug up the bottom, it comes in one side
     of the top and goes out the other,

[290325]

     it's rather difficult to use yaw in zero right
     away. So what I'm doing, yaw is working toward
     zero right now. Pitch is working toward 90,
     and roll is working toward - zero. So, we -
     We're just going to take some time to get there, that's all.

     and we went up to the upstairs kitchen and
     drained water a couple of more times, and made
     up a whole bunch of drink bags, again; and from
     the pantry, we retrieved a fairly large - enclosed

_tape : Tape 54/12
CC:  Okay. First, midcourse correction will probably
     be at GET 104 hours, and all we look for is a
     4- to 6-feet-per-second DELTA-V. Okay. That's
     the first item. Now, I will give you a rundown
     on consumables. Okay. In the LM, you hlave 1498 -
     that is 1 4 9 8 amp-hours remaining. That means
     over 61 hours you'd - That would average out to
     24.5 amps. We expect that, after powerdown, that
     you will use 1 4 or 14 amps per hour, and that
     would leave a reserve of 500 amp-hours at the
     end of the mission. Are you with me?

_tape : Tape 54/12
CDR: We're with you.

[294457]
_page : 366
_tape : Tape 54/12
CC:  Roger. In the LM, you have 215, that is 2 1 5,
     pounds of water, usable. That would average out
     over 61 hours to 3.5 pounds per hour available.
     Okay.

[294495]
_page : 366
_tape : Tape 54/12
CC:  Okay. And after you power down, we expect that
     you will be using water at the rate of 3.2 to
     2.7 pounds - That's at 14 amps per hour electrical
     usage rate. One note, this does not - When we
     speak here of water available, this does not include 
     CSM water and PLSS water, so that's add
     on. Okay, next, LiOH. Using the CSM cans, you
     will have 16 cans at 12 hours per cam to give
     you 1 9 2, or 192 hours, of LiOH. And, in the
     LM, using its cans, you have 44 hours remaining.

[294569]
_page : 366
_tape : Tape 54/12
CDR: Vance, is that with the PLSS secondaries?

[294574]
_page : 366

     PLSS secondaries.

[294587]
_page : 366
_tape : Tape 54/12
CC:  Okay; oxygen. You have remaining 44 pounds in
     the LM. At a usage rate of 0.36 pounds per hour,
     that leaves you 120, or 1 2 0, hours of oxygen.
     Okay. Next, RCS. RCS A stands at 6 2 percent
     and B at 6 2 percent. We only expect 2 percent
     to be used for the PTC, so you're in good shape
     for RCS. Next, DPS DELTA-V. You have 1190 feet
     per second remaining. And, fina]]y, CSM EPS.
     We estimate that you have 99 amp-hours. That's
     an estimate. And that's it. Over.

     to hear from Jack to see if he thinks vhat
     main B bus is good. If he has any idea of how,
     if whether it's good or not, this would influence 
     our steps in the future; for example, we
     might want to try to test main B to see ii' it is,
     in fact, good so that we'd know how to set switches
     for entry.

[294720]

_extra : 
CMP: Okay. Let me give you my observations on main
     bus B. Things happened pretty fast there, and
     we first heard the impact or explosion or whatever caused 
     it, I'm not sure. The next - About
     1 second later, there was a MASTER ALARM which
     was the MAIN BUS B UNDERVOLT. I looked at the
     voltage, and the voltage was good at this time
     so I'm suspecting it was a spike. Fuel cell 3
     was also good, with good flow. However, Fred,
     at that point, was coming into the command
     module and got over into his seat. At that
     time, we shortly had an AC BUS 2 light about the
     time he got into his seat. He looked at the
     MAIN BUS B and the MAIN BUS B was reading ZERO.
     It, however, - and the fuel cell flows were
     ZERO. I'm kind of suspecting that perhaps we do
     have a MAIN - a current MAIN BUS B. But that's
     merely a guess. I never did try to reset it.
     We were having other problems with the MAIN BUS A,
     having an UNDERVOLT and a few other things like
     that. I'd kind of like to hear what your feelings
     are down there.

[295337]
_page : 370
_tape : Tape 54/17

     configure them as you see them.

[295351]
_page : 370
_tape : Tape 54/17
CDR: Okay, now, Jack ... We have put the TCAs in for
     the previous procedure. Do you want those out, now?

[295368]
_page : 370
_tape : Tape 54/17
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim, Pull them out. TCAs
     open.

[295374]
_page : 371
_tape : Tape 54/13
CDR: Okay. I'm changing those to ... back again.
     First three rows. And you're pulling the ATCA
     PGNS, huh?

[295384]
_page : 371
_tape : Tape 54/13
CC:  That's affirmative. Pull ATCA PGNS open.

[295391]
_page : 371
_tape : Tape 54/13
CDR: Okay. I've done that.

[295400]
_page : 371
_tape : Tape 54/13
CC:  Okay. Are you ready for the fourth row?

[295405]
_page : 371
_tape : Tape 54/13
CDR: Affirm.

[295407]
_page : 371
_tape : Tape 54/13
CC:  Okay. Now when we get in the fourth row, we're
     going to open the IMU OPERATE circuit breaker;
     and what that means is that we're going to lose
     the capability to watch your CDUs, so we're not
     going to be able to see your attitude. Therefore, 
     we will not be able to advise you on which
     antenna to select for communications. The way
     we want you to hsmdle that is to turn the LM
     UPLINK SQUELCH off, and when you hear the nolse,
     switch antennas. We'll be able to see you switch
     antennas, and it's going to take us about 3 to
     5 minutes to establish a lockon again after you
     switch. After each time that you switch antennas,
     we will initiate a voice check. And basically
     when you see the Earth out the window, you can
     be on FORWARD antenna, and when the Moon's up in
     the window use the AFT antenna. You copy?

[295481]
_page : 371
_tape : Tape 54/13
CDR: Okay. We're going to pull the IMU OPERATE 
     circuit breaker, so you won't be able to see our
     attitude. Therefore, you won't tell us how to
     switch antennas and we'll enable the - I will
     turn the - up the SQUELCH OFF so that when we
     start getting any static, we'll switch antennas
     and as a thumb rule we could use - with the Earth
     forward, we use the FORWARD antenna and when we
     see the Moon we use the AFT antenna.

[295512]
_page : 371
_tape : Tape 54/13
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. In other words, we're
     leaving the antenna switching up to you, and
     after you switch antennas it's going to take
     3 to 5 minutes for us to establish a lockon
     again, and we'll initiate a voice check. And
     I'm ready to go on panel 11, row 4.

[295534]
_page : 372
_tape : Tape 55/1
CDR: Okay.

[295536]
_page : 372
_tape : Tape 55/1
CC:  Okay. On row 14,under HEATERS RCS SYSTEM A/B-1:
     open QUAD 1 through 4; under ECS, the only change
     is - under GLYCOL PUMP close AUTO TRANSFER; under
     COMM, the only change is: open VHF A RECEIVER,
     open COMMANDER AUDIO; under PGNS, the only change
     is: close and leave closed IMU STANDBY circuit
     breaker, so we can have heaters. Read back.

[295590]
_page : 372
_tape : Tape 55/1
CDR: Okay. On row 4, we're going to open all four off
     the heaters - the RCS SYSTEM A and B - the first
     four circuit breakers. We're going to close the
     AUTO TRANSFER. We're going to open the VHF A
     RECEIVER and the COMMANDER AUDIO. And we're
     going to close the IMU STANDBY. The LGC DSKY
     and the IMU OPERATE will be open.

[295625]
_page : 372
_tape : Tape 55/1
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. All other breakers in
     that row are as you see them in the checklist.
     And on row 5, the only change is that we want
     you to, under EPS, open ASCENT ECA CONTROL. Over.

[295645]
_page : 372
_tape : Tape 55/1
CDR: Roger. I think we already have that opened -
     ASCENT ECA CONTROL is probably already open.

[295656]
_page : 372
_tape : Tape 55/1
CDR: Okay. So let me confirm. We'll have one COMM
     system, that will be the LMP system, and we'll
     have to do our own antenna switching; therefore,
     we'll have to wait about - Okay, why don't you
     switch? Aft antenna.

[295684]
_page : 372
_tape : Tape 55/1
CDR: We'll have to wait for you to get a lockon again.
     Is that correct?

[295694]
_page : 372
_tape : Tape 55/1
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. You'll be working off
     of the LMP's panel over there.

[295702]
_page : 372
_tape : Tape 55/1
CDR: Okay. What else do you have for me?

[295704]
_page : 372
_tape : Tape 55/1
CC:  Okay. Panel 16, that's on page Power-7. Top
     row, the only change is: under RCS SYSTEM B, open PQGS/DISPLAYS. Over.

[295730]
_page : 372
_tape : Tape 55/1
CDR: Okay. I may go over this with you, Jack, 
     because this checklist has been written over two
     or three times now on our various procedures.
     Top row, the first two are open, the next three
     are closed, and we're going to open now the
     QUAD TCA's 1, 2, 3, 4; CROSSFEED will be closed,
     and the TEMP/PRESS DISFLAYFLAG will be opened,
     and we're going to open up the PQCS, MAIN SOV
     will be closed, and the ... will be opened.

[295766]
_page : 373
_tape : Tape 55/2
CC: That's affirmative, Jim. And there's no change
     to the second row. Over.

[295778]
_page : 373
_tape : Tape 55/2
CDR: Okay. Again let me ge through this with you.
     The first four are going to be closed. The next
     sev - eight will be - the next nine will be open
     from LOGIC POWER B through DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE
     How about the CWEA? Is that going to be closed?

[295808]
_page : 373
_tape : Tape 55/2
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. We want the next five
     closed.

[295815]
_page : 373
_tape : Tape 55/2
CDR: Okay.

[295816]
_page : 373
_tape : Tape 55/2
CC:  Okay. In the third row, under COMM: DISPLAY,
     open; SE AUDIO, closed; VHF A TRANSMITTER,
     open - That's a change - VHF B RECEIVER, open;
     PRIMARY S-BAND, POWER AMPLIFIER, open;
     TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER, closed; S-BAND ANTENNA,
     open; PMP, closed; TV, open. Under ECS:
     DISRLAYS, open; GLYCOL PUMP SECONDARY, open;
     LOC PUMP, open; CABIN FAN CONTROL, open; CABIN
     REPRESS, closed; and all the next four closed
     also. Read back.

[295872]
_page : 373
_tape : Tape 55/2
CDR: Okay. We have DISPLAY, open; SE AUDIO, closed;
     VHF A TRANSMITTER, open; VHF B RECEIVER, open;
     POWER AMP's going to be open; TRANSMITTER/
     RECEIVER, closed; S-BAND ANTENNA, open; PMP,
     closed; TV, open; DISPLAY is open; next three
     are open; CABIN REPRESS, closed; and all the
     rest closed.

[295896]
_page : 373
_tape : Tape 55/2
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. And in row 4, under
     HEATERS, we want them all - Correction - we
     want all the QUAD HEATERS open. Correction -
     we want all the QUAD HEATERS closed.

[295913]
_page : 373
_tape : Tape 55/2
CDR: All the - -

[295914]
_page : 373
_tape : Tape 55/2
CC:  We want DISPLAY, open; S-BAND ANTENNA, closed -
     to avoid a MASTER ALARM, CAMERA - SEQUENCE
     CAMERA, open; And under EPS, we want DISPLAYs,
     open; DC BUS VOLT, closed; INVERTER 2, open;
     ASCENT ECA, closed; ASCENT ECA CONTROL, open;
     DESCENT ECA, closed; DESCENT ECA CONTROL, closed;
     TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE, close; we want the CROSS
     TIE BUS, open; the BAL LOADS, closed; BAT FEED
     TIEs, closed. How do you read?

[295966]
_page : 374
_tape : Tape 55/3
CDR: Okay. The four RCS HEATERS will be closed;
     DISPLAYS, open; S-BAND ANTENNA, closed; CAMERA
     SEQUENCE will be open; DISPLAY will be open; DC
     BUS VOLT will be closed; INVERTER 2 open;
     ASCENT ECA will he closed, but the ASCENT ECA
     CONTROL, open; DESCENT ECA, closed; DESCENT ECA
     CONTROL, closed; TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE, closed;
     and CROSS TIE BUS, open; and BALANCE LOADS,
     closed; and the BAT FEED TIEs, closed. I have
     one question, Jack. On panel - on the second
     line there under LIGHTING, why are we keeping:
     the FLOODS and TRACK closed? Or are they going
     to be open?

[296013]
_page : 374
_tape : Tape 55/3
CC:  Negative. We have thc, LIGHTING breakers all
     closed. Control the lighting with the switches
     and rheostats. Over.

[296024]
_page : 374
_tape : Tape 55/3
CDR: Okay. We don't need the floodlights, I don't
     think, but we can do it that way, I guess.

[296031]
_page : 374
_tape : Tape 55/3
CC:  And under row 4, under RCS SYSTEMS A/B-2, QUAD
     HEATERS, you notice that we've closed those
     circuit breakers, but what we want you to do is
     to - on panel 3, turn the RCS A/B-2 QUAD switches
     1, 2, 3, and 4, off. Over.

[296068]
_page : 374
_tape : Tape 55/3
CC:  And we're going to watch your quad temps for you,
     and when we need to warm them up a little bit,
     we'll tell you to throw those four switches on -
     on panel 3.

[296083]
_page : 374
_tape : Tape 55/3
CDR: Okay. Now are we sure that this PTC mode is
     good enough so we don't ... get crossed up later
     and get out of configuration.

[296093]
_page : 374
_tape : Tape 55/3
CC:  Stand by 1 on that, Jim. Okay, Jim, as far as
     we can tell right now, the PTC looks as good as
     any PTC we've ever seen in a CSM, so we're going
     to go with what we've got.

[296116]
_page : 374
_tape : Tape 55/3
CDR: Okay.

[296118]
_page : 374
_tape : Tape 55/3
CC:  Okay, and if you turn over the page on Power 8,
     we have the spacecraft functions remaining to
     you. We've got low bit rate TM. However, we
     don't have any VHF. We have CWEA. We have
     GLYCOL PUMPS. We have SUIT FANS. We have
     CABIN REPRESS for you, and stand by in ATTITUDE
     CONTROL here. Okay, in ATTITUDE CONTROL, we'll
     have hardovers for uses in emergency, and for
     normal usage we want to have a 15-minute delay
     to get the heaters on to warm them up be before
     use. How do you read?

[296166]
_page : 375
_tape : Tape 55/4
CDR: Okay. For emergency, we have the hardovers and
     for normal use it requires a 15-minute request
     to get the heaters on.

[296176]
_page : 375
_tape : Tape 55/4
CC:  That's affirmative.

[296188]
_page : 375
_tape : Tape 55/4

     they - Can't we monitor our CDU's any more to
     tell when to switch antennas, so they've just -
     When they can see it switch - it will take a

_tape : 
LMP: I see you luck out with all the good shifts.

[297747]
_page : 379
_tape :

     brief you on the COMM mode so, you got any questions about that?

[297760]
_page : 379
_tape : 
LMP: Okay.

[297786]
_page : 379
_tape : 
CC: And how is your PTC going? I heard Jack tell
     you that we can't see your CDU's. How's it going?

[297797]
_page : 379
_tape : 
LMP: Well, let's see, we may be offsetting slightly,
     the Sun looks like it may be a little higher
     now. Here comes the Earth by and it looks about
     the same perspective. I'll have to wait to see
     the Moon on the other side, Jack. ...

[297817]
_page : 379
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Fred, I can't hear you any more on account
     of the background noise. I assume that - I think
     I heard Jack tell you what we're going to do
     about COMM. UPLINK SQUELCH, off. You'll take
     care of the antennas because we can't see your
     attitude. We'll give you a voice check when
     come up. it'll take us 3 to 5 minutes to come
     up. And to make it astronaut-proof, when you
     see the Earth, use a forward antenna; when you
     see the Moon, use the aft one.

[297848]
_page : 379
_tape : 
LMP: Yes, that's pretty straightforward. Okay, I see
     the Earth so I've very wisely shifted to FORWARD.

LMP: Earth will be by over there in a minute.

[298044]

_tape : Tape 55/9
LMP: And, Jack, you still up?

[298048]
_page : 380
_tape : Tape 55/9
CC:  Still here, Fred.

[298052]
_page : 380
_tape : Tape 55/9
LMP: Okay, when I was upstairs, just a minute ago, 1
     noticed what appeared to be some new ventinxs
     from down the service module way. I noticed
     that out window 1, and also saw one chunk of
     metal - loose metal about 4 inches square that
     was tumbling around - silver in color, and it,
     looked like it had come from somewhere down in
     the service module.

[298084]
_page : 380
_tape : Tape 55/9
CC:  Okay. You saw some venting out window 1 - -

[298085]
_page : 380
_tape : Tape 55/9
LMP: And I -

[298088]
_page : 380
_tape : Tape 55/9
CC:  Go ahead.

[298090]
_page : 380
_tape : Tape 55/9
LMP: Yes, that's where I happened to be looking. The
     lighting was such that it showed up out there.
     What reminded me of it was I'm looking out the
     LM window now and I sea a good part of the new
     star field it's created for us. There are about
     a thousand little sparklies out here.

[298110]
_page : 380
_tape : Tape 55/9
CC:  Okay, so you're seeing some venting out window 1,
     and you saw a 4-inch-square piece of loose metal
     which was silver, and - Are you still seeing the
     venting or has it zeroed out now?

[298128]
_page : 380
_tape : Tape 55/9
LMP: I don't know. I left upstairs, I'm down in the
     LM now, Jack. I guess when Jack goes up he can
     take a look and let me know. Okay, I'll think
     about switching aft here directly. I see the
     Moon, and the Moon looks pretty good, Jack, so
     I guess our PTC still doing pretty good.

[298149]
_page : 380
_tape : Tape 55/9
CC:  Okay, and we won't have any COMM delay if the
     PTC stays good.

[298172]
_page : 380
_tape : Tape 55/9
LMP: Yes, sure enough the Moon is getting smaller.

[298177]
_page : 380
_tape : Tape 55/9
CC:  Good, and we want to ask you another question
     about the venting. Is this - would you suppose -
     some new venting or is this venting that you
     just hadn't - that's been going on all the time,
     but which you hadn't looked at recently?

[298196]
_page : 381
_tape : Tape 55/10
LMP: I can't really say, Jack, we've been so tied up
     down in the LM, I guess we kind of forgot about
     the other half. But I've been upstairs several
     times and hadn't particularly noticed any flow
     by the windows before, so I - my first assumption 
     was that it was some new venting. It really wasn't very heavy.

[298223]
_page : 381
_tape : Tape 55/10
CC:  Okay. Copy. Thank you.

[298225]
_page : 381
_tape : Tape 55/10
LMP: And Jack's going up to take a look now.

[298227]
_page : 381
_tape : Tape 55/10
CC:  Okay. And for your information, all of our
     numbers are based on amperage usage of 14 amps.
     And we're using only 12.3, so we're a little
     fat on our analysis.

[298249]
_page : 381
_tape : Tape 55/10
LMP: Very good. Way to be.

[298252]
_page : 381
_tape : Tape 55/10
CC:  And we're in a - -

[298253]
_page : 381
_tape : Tape 55/10
LMP: I'll tell you, this Aquarius has really been a
     winner.

[298261]
_page : 381
_tape : Tape 55/10
CC:  Well, that's one of several. And we want to tell
     you something that I told Jim earlier, and that
     concerns control. Right now you have control in
     hardover if you need it, but when we go to some
     normal control modes, since we have the quad
     heaters off. We want to have a 15-minute notice
     for attitude control request. Over.

[298295]
_page : 381
_tape : Tape 55/10
LMP: Okay, Jack. Offhand, I can't imagine that since
     we got the platform powered down why we'd need
     to worry about the instantaneous control. But
     at any rate, we need 15-minutes warmup with the
     heaters before we can start using thrusters.

[298314]
_page : 381
_tape : Tape 55/10
CC:  Right. And another thing we've done is to pull
     your ECS and EPC DISPLAY breakers and so - But
     we left your CAUTION and WARNING powered up.
     So if you get ECS-type or EPS CAUTION and WARNING
     you'll have to power up those meters with the
     DISPLAY breakers. And we are watching for you
     your PIPA temperatures, your ASA TEMP, your
     propellant temperatures except for the DPS propellant, 
     and we're watching your quad temps for
     you.

[298351]
_page : 381
_tape : Tape 55/10
LMP: Okay. That's very good, Jack. You're watching
     them. That's good enough.

[298361]
_page : 382
_tape : Tape 55/11
CC: And everybody's fine at home El Lago.

[298370]
_page : 382
_tape : Tape 55/11
LMP: Great.

[298371]
_page : 382
_tape : Tape 55/11
CC:  And, Fred, your CO<sub>2</sub> is building up. 
     It's at 11 on our gage, and we've got a medical buildup to
     15 millimeters, at which time we'll switch over
     to secondary. Looks like we've got plenty of
     lithium hydroxide, about 192 hours including the
     CSM cartridges. And as you know, we've got a
     way to use those. And as soon as we get them
     written in some good words, why, we'll pass; that
     along. You might be able to make one.

[298453]
_page : 382
_tape : Tape 55/11
LMP: Okay. Yes, we'll sure give her a try. And I'm
     showing onboard about 12-1/2 millimeters of mercury.

[298464]
_page : 382
_tape : Tape 55/11
CC: Roger. And I have a flight plan update when
     you get a time to copy it sometime, I'll pass
     it along. There's no hurry on it.

[298475]
_page : 382
_tape : Tape 55/11
LMP: Okay. Stand by 1. Jack's back now.

[298488]
_page : 382
_tape : Tape 55/11
LMP: Okay. Jack just came hack and he said it's still
     coming out; it's only coming out on the commander's
     side. So he saw it out the saxne window I did,
     window 1. And it's between the minus Y and
     minus Z axis.

[298507]
_page : 382
_tape : Tape 55/11
CC:  Okay. And of course - -

[298508]
_page : 382
_tape : Tape 55/11
LMP: Jack says it's definitely the service module
     which was - which was my impression, too.

[298514]
_page : 382
_tape : Tape 55/11
CC:  Okay. So you're sure it's the service module,
     and, of course, the thing we're interested in
     knowing, is it something that is residual from
     before, or is it something new. And if you have
     any ideas about that, why we'd sure like to have them
     them.

[298541]
_page : 382
_tape : Tape 55/11
LMP: Yes. Yes, Jack, I'll answer him your question in
     a minute, but make Jack's first impresison here,
     is that it's not near the intensity that it was right after our mishap.
     And I'll have to agree with that.
     I'd say - he said it was a half and
     I said it was maybe down to a third. And
     Houston would like to know if you have any impressions 
     as to whether it is still a residual
     from that or maybe something new.

[298585]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
LMP: I don't know why after I felt that. Yen, I felt
     it was some new something - new venting, too.

[298626]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
LMP: Okay. Switch to FORWARD OMNI.

[298631]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
CC:  Fred-o, if you think it's practical, we're ready
     to give you some - we're working on some camera
     settings for pictures of the venting. And, if
     you have a camera out and ready to go, let us
     know which one it is so we can get the settings
     for that camera. What do you think about that?

[298650]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
LMP: Okay. Jack's got the one with the 250-millimeter
     lens on it. That's the standard EL. And I have
     a surface camera out that I've been shooting
     hundreds of Earth/Moon pictures with, canera 1.
     ad we also have the Reseau upstairs that's
     pretty handy. The command module DC camera.
     so you can about - -

[298680]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
CC: Okay. I copy that - -

[298681]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
LMP: - - take your choice, because - -

[298684]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
CC: I copy the 250 millimeter, the Reseau is available, 
     but I didn't get what other one is;.

[298694]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
LMP: Okay. I got my Hasselblad surface camera down
     in the LM here handy, too, camera 1.

[298804]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
LMP: And, Jack, if we're going to do any picture taking
     out the command module windows, I think we'd better
     do that pretty quick, or hold up until Jim and
     Jack get their rest done.

[298821]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
CC:  We concur with that.

[298883]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
CC:  Okay, Fred, we're not going to bother the skipper
     up there. We won't be taking any pictures out of
     the command module window until after rest period.

[298894]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
LMP: Okay.

[299459]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
LMP: Shifting to FORWARD OMNI.

[299504]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
CC:  Okay. Fred, for your information, your CO<sub>2</sub> 
     reading onboard is a little higher than what we're
     reading here on the ground, and so when it gets
     to 15 on your meter, switch to secondary. And
     we'd like to get a status about every 30 minutes -
     we'll give you a call on that. But just to let
     us know we're still thinking about you, we'd like
     you to go BIOMED RIGHT, please.

[299534]
_page : 384
_tape : Tape 55/13
LMP: Okay, Going BIOMED RIGHT.

[299637]
_page : 384
_tape : Tape 55/13
LMP: Hey, how do you read me on this COMM mode on
     S-band?

[299643]
_page : 384

[300488]
_page : 384
_tape : Tape 55/13
CC:  We're still here, Fred. How's it going?

[300491]
_page : 384
_tape : Tape 55/13
LMP: Okay. My CO2 reading is now just below 13.

[300501]
_page : 384
_tape : Tape 55/13
CC:  Say again what it is.

[300505]
_page : 384
_tape : Tape 55/13
LMP: It's just - just below 13.

[300509]
_page : 384
_tape : Tape 55/13
CC:  Okay. Just below 13. And just for your 
     information, we've got people working on several
     subjects. We're working on the midcourse coming
     up to determine our control system and how to do
     it with the control system we select, what we
     should do about the alinement. We've got the
     LMS and a couple of crews cranked up working on
     that. And we're also working on our entry, how
     and when we ought to activate the CSM. And
     we're working on the CSM systems status. 
     Tomorrow sometime we're going to have a MAIN BUS B
     checkout, so we've got a lot of people swinging
     pretty hard here and I've got some f-stop settings
     for you for the lvanar-surface camera. At 1/250th,
     we'd like you to take targets of opportunity.
     Each picture use three f-stops, because we don't
     know exactly which one is going to work the best,
     so use 4, 5.6, and 8 and 1/250th for the surface
     camera. Copy?

[300592]
_page : 384
_tape : Tape 55/13
LMP: Okay. Use the surface camera at 1/250th, 4, 5.6,
     and 8. And I've been doing quite a bit of 
     shooting at covering two of those numbers in the range
     5.6, and 8. I've also been shooting some at 11,
     so I'll just drop it down a little more. The
     Moon is still so big and bright there that I got
     a feeling that the Moon is probably up around the
     f/8 to f/11 range.

[300626]
_page : 384
_tape : Tape 55/13
CC:  Roger, I didn't catch that last part. Maybe when
     the COMM gets a little better you can say it
     again.

[300643]
_page : 384
_tape : Tape 55/13
LMP: Okay. How do you read now, Jack?

[300645]
_page : 384
_tape : Tape 55/13
CC:  That's a lot better, Fred.

[300648]
_page : 385
_tape : Tape 55/14
LMP: Okay, I just said the Moon is still so bright,
     that I think probably the higher range of f-stops
     will be better; f/8, maybe even f/11.

[300662]
_page : 385
_tape : Tape 55/14
CC: Okay.

[300671]
_page : 385
_tape : Tape 55/14
LMP: I can just barely, on the left corner of the Moon
     now, make out the foothills of Fra Mauro 
     formation. We never did get to see it when we were in close, there.

[300693]
_page : 385
_tape : Tape 55/14
CC:  Okay. I'm reading on my monitor here, Fred, that
     you're 16214 miles away from the Moon moving at
     about 4500 feet per second.

[300716]
_page : 385
_tape : Tape 55/14
LMP: Okay.

[300741]
_page : 385
_tape : Tape 55/14
LMP: From the sounds of all the work that is going
     on and is still going on, this flight is probably
     a lot bigger test for the system on the ground than up here.

[300761]
_page : 385
_tape : Tape 55/14
CC:  Yes, you've been - you've been working it out a
     little bit.

[300775]
_page : 385
_tape : Tape 55/14
LMP: Yes. I've really got a tough job right now
     switching OMNIs.

[300788]
_page : 385
_tape : Tape 55/14
CC:  Well, everybody down here is 100-percent
     optimistic. Looks like we're on the up side of the whole thing now.

[300801]
_page : 385
_tape : Tape 55/14
LMP: Yes, I guess we had better be in good shape,
     particularly ourselves, rested for that entry
     day. I think that is going to be a pretty busy one.

[300813]
_page : 385
_tape : Tape 55/14
CC:  Right, and we're working on procedures for that.
     Ken's been doing quite a bit of work on getting

     at 104 hours - about 20 hours from now - 18 hours
     from now, and it's only 7 feet per second. The
     other option is to keep PTC up, since we may not
     be able to get back into it again, and delay it.
     So, that's the type of thing we're thinking about,
     but - just wanted to let you know that you're
     pretty much right in the middle of Lhe fairway
     there and our present tracking, with no midcourse,
     has you - with a Gamma of 7.11, as opposed to
     6.51. So, you're already in the corridor. You're
     just a half a degree between the center and the
     outer limits and we're going to tweek that up.

[301695]
_page : 386
_tape : Tape 56/1
LMP: Okay. That sounds good.

[301700]
_page : 386
_tape : Tape 56/1
CC:  And - we dont - Well, we think there might have
     been a misunderstanding earlier on the potable
     water. Don't worry about drinking water. Drink
     all you want. There's plenty of it. There's
     38 pounds, and the Surgeon recommends that you
     use some of the fruit juices as well. Over.

[301723]
_page : 386
_tape : Tape 56/1
LMP: Okay. Yes, we went up and - and used the
     procedure to pressurize surge tank, and Jack and I
     made up a total of 22 drinks of - drinking water.

[301742]
_page : 386
_tape : Tape 56/1
CC:  Okay.

[301759]
_page : 386
_tape : Tape 56/1
CC:  And I assume that Jack is up there sleeping now
     too, right?

[301766]
_page : 386
_tape : Tape 56/1
LMP: Yes. That's affirm. They're both up there.

[301780]
_page : 386
_tape : Tape 56/1
LMP: I hate to say it, Jack, but I think our PTC is
     about to wobble off a little bit. I've noticed
     that the Earth is coming by somewhat lower in
     the window and the Moon is going by somewhat
     higher.

[301799]
_page : 386
_tape : Tape 56/1
CC:  Okay. Understand. PTC, Earth is coming by
     lower and Moon is coming by higher.

[301809]
_page : 386
_tape : Tape 56/1
LMP: Yes.

[301918]
_page : 387
_tape : Tape 56/2
CC: And, Fred, on this jerry-rigged command module
     lithium hydroxide canister, what we're going to
     do is we're going to have to make at least two
     up and use two at a time - one on each set of
     hoses. What we'll do is we'll connect one of
     these jerry-rigged boxes to the red fittings and
     air will be sucked through the lithium hydroxide
     and then blown out the blue fitting. And we're
     also going to, when we do this, remove the LM
     lithium hydroxide canister from the suit loop,
     either the primary or the secondary, and we're
     getting the words together to make it easy to
     build one of these things, and it looks like it
     will probably take two guys, so, I think we
     probably ought to plan to do that later. In
     addition, we have to go up and get a couple of
     canisters out of the command module, so it looks
     like maybe a smart idea would be to delay a little
     bit and have you build a couple of these later on.
     What do you think?

[301997]
_page : 387
_tape : Tape 56/2
LMP: Yes. I agree, Jack. Jack Swigert and I went
     upstairs earlier and both got a canister, and
     we were scratching around for some material and
     thinking about using them, and that's actually
     why - when we made up all the water to drink
     because we needed the plastic container that they
     were housed in in the pantry, and we had that
     ready to use with some material plus some of the -
     the extra porous bags that were going to be used
     for the dump control that we may Just cut up and
     use, too.

[302034]
_page : 387
_tape : Tape 56/2
CC:  Did you come up with a design or - -

[302036]
_page : 387
_tape : Tape 56/2
CDR: Plus we got lots - -

[302040]
_page : 387
_tape : Tape 56/2
LMP: No. We just thought we'd see what we had in the
     way of material and stand by for your word. Of
     course, we also have lots of stiff-backed cardboard flight data.

[302055]
_page : 387
_tape : Tape 56/2
CC:  Yes. We have decided to use a canister and, you
     know that the liquid-cooled garment has a bag
     around it that we think we can use, too, or that
     we know we can use. We've tried it. So what you
     have is the - a bag within a bag and inside that
     is the liquid-cooled garment. The bag that is
     closest to the liquid-cooled garment is the one
     we need, and we've got two of them. And then,
     of course, we've got to use some tape and, as
     you say, one of the backs to flight data file
     time line book or something like that, and, just
     using those materials, we can make this 
     jerry-rigged canister. So, the bag that we're looking
     for is the one that is right next to the 
     liquid-cooled garment, and, if we're very careful about
     where we cut it, we can make a pretty good rig.

[302128]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
LMP: Okay.

[302131]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
CC:  It looks like we'll have to use that bag over
     again, though, because we only got two of them,
     and I expect that we'll have to make more than
     two of these canisters up.

[302144]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
LMP: Roger.

[302195]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
CC:  Fred, in about 4 minutes, we're going to hand you
     over to a different communications site, and it's
     going to take us about a minute or so to 
     reestablish uplink, so you can be prepared for that.

[302211]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
LMP: Okay, Jack.

[302440]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
CC:  Fred-o, we've handed over now. How do you read?

[302446]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
LMP: Loud and clear, Jack.

[302448]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
CC:  Same here.

[302456]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
LMP: In fact, you're coming in a little louder.

[302463]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
CC:  Fred, you'll have to say again. Can't read you
     there. There's too much background noise.
     Maybe we need a new antenna.

[302474]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
LMP: Okay. I'm on the other OMNI now. I just said
     that you're coming in even louder than previously.

[302484]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
CC:  Roger. Maybe it's because I'm standing up. You're
     coming in better now, too.

[302686]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
LMP: And, for your information, Jack, I'm just going
     to tear into some beef and gravy and other assorted goodies.

[302701]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
CC:  I presume that you're doing this with the full
     permission and - of the commander.

[302719]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
LMP: And this - at this moment, who do you think is
     the commander?

[302731]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
CC:  If I was him, I'd make you sign out everything
     you ate, so I'd know.

[302756]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
LMP: Well, I'm sneaking inside of the LM where he
     doesn't have ... Incidentally, this PTC must
     have some - must have a wobble mode around our
     X-axis there because now the Moon and Earth are
     back in the right perspective.

[302778]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
CC:  Good. Let's see if it goes the other way.

[302800]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
CC: These guys down here are saying they knew it all
     the time.

[302816]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
LMP: Well, that's right. They do good work. Whoever
     heard of doing a P52 in the LM?

[302928]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
CC:  Say, Fred, sometime when you're not too busy
     chewing on that beef, how about telling us what
     the CO<sub>2</sub> reads?

[302943]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
LMP: Okay, I'm reading 13, 1 3.

[302947]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
CC:  Okay. It looks like our reading is getting kind
     of close to yours.

[303279]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
LMP: Yes. It appears the wobble is going the other
     way, Jack, because the Earth is now rising and
     the Moon is starting to get lower in the window.

[303292]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
CC:  Roger. Could you give us an LPD number
     periodically?

[303302]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
LMP: LPD number? Yes, okay.

[303309]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
CC:  In fact, if you could give it two or three REVs
     in a row, why then we could predict where it's
     going and maybe help us set it up again if we
     have to.

[303322]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
LMP: Okay.

[303336]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
LMP: Okay. The center of the Earth has just gone by
     at an LPD number of 4.

[303342]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
CC:  Roger. LPD 4, center of the Earth.

[303659]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
LMP: And the center of the Moon is about LPD 21.

[303664]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
CC:  Okay. LPD 21. Is that the center of the Moon,
     you say?

[303671]
_page : 390
_tape : 
LMP: That's affirm.

[303772]
_page : 390
_tape : 
CC:  And, Fred, we're doing a little better on our
     water than we had anticipated. Our numbers
     were designed for 3.5 pounds per houri we're
     using about 3.0, and expect to go a little bit
     less.

[303791]
_page : 390
_tape : 
LMP: Beautiful.

[303812]
_page : 390
_tape : 
LMP: When this flight's all over, we'll really be able
     to figure out what a LM can do.

[303842]
_page : 390
_tape : 
CC:  Maybe it'll make the ...

[303849]
_page : 390
_tape : 
LMP: If it had a heat shield, I'd say bring it home.

[304038]
_page : 390
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. The Earth went - just went by about - clear
     above the LPD index. It was - it was, if it
     were extended, the number would he minus 6.

[304054]
_page : 390
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Way up there at minus 6.

[304061]
_page : 390
_tape : 
LMP: Yes, there's actually no such number. I just
     extended the line beyond zero which, for a negative rate, is 
     what it would be if there was one.

[304073]
_page : 390
_tape : 
CC:  Right. If minus 6 was there, that's where it
     would be. Right?

[304082]
_page : 390
_tape : 
LMP: That's right.

[304093]
_page : 390
_tape : 
CC:  Do you still have that super-dense star field?

[304105]
_page : 390
_tape : 
LMP: It's still there. I'm looking at it right now.
     I can look at - the Sun is right behind me,
     then all these sparklies show up. Yes. It kind
     of looks like I'm right in the middle of the - of
     the Milky Way. There are several thousand little
     sparklies at various ranges out as far as I can
     see ...

[304158]
_page : 390
_tape : 
LMP: They're kind of interesting. They're all moving
     ... and sparkling there. And I can ... - at
     least I think I can what will occasionally give
     you a real star from the bunch of sparklies,
     but it really does break up the capability to
     pick out a star pattern, particularly through ...

[304192]
_page : 390
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. So far, we haven't identified what the
     sparklies are and what is venting.

[304212]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
LMP: Yes, I got a.... feeling that we probably won't
     get any ... until we pewer up.

[304448]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
CC:  How you feeling, Fred?

[304456]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
LMP: Oh, as soon as I chug down this grape drink and
     grapefruit - orange drink, I think I'll be in pretty good shape.

[304478]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
CC:  How much sleep did you get between the burn and
     the time you got up for this exercise?

[304490]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
LMP: Oh, I'd guesstimate about 4 hours, Jack. Wait a
     minute, which burn you talking about?

[304503]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
CC:  It was the burn we just made. Did you get any
     sleep between it, and the time you got up for this watch?

[304512]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
LMP: Oh, no. I didn't - I haven't been to bed since
     all the action the night before, and I went to
     go to bed for about 4 hours then ...

[304522]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
CC:  Yes.

[304538]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
CC:  Well, we're just trying to figure out who's
     likely to be the most tired up there. You or Jim.

[304555]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
LMP: I think we'll get caught up pretty good in thc
     next couple of days.

[304560]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
CC:  Say again.

[304564]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
LMP: We ought to get caught up pretty good in the
     next couple of days.

[304736]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
LMP: Okay, Jack. The Earth has started back down.
     The hack on the LPD there was 1 degree.

[304746]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
CC:  Okay. One degree on the center of the Earth.

[304933]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
CC:  That was a good TV show you put on the other
     night, Fred, during LM entry.

[304946]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
LMP: Yes. It would have been an even better one about
     10 minutes later.

[304970]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
CC:  Yes. Things sure turned to worms there in a
     hurry after that show.

[304992]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
LMP: Yes. You're right.

[305008]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
LMP: Okay. The center of thc Moon new is about
     minus 2 degrees DELTA-V.

[305015]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
CC:  Minus 2 degrees, center of the Moon.

[305084]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
CC:  Charlie said to say hello.

[305091]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
LMP: Who's that?

[305093]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
CC: Charlie.

[305098]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
LMP: Is he still around there?

[305116]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
LMP: Unless my watch is wrong, it says it's almost
     2 a.m. hack there.

[305122]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
CC:  No. That's the bearded one.

[305129]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
LMP: Oh! Okay.

[305175]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
LMP: Iley, tell Charlie that I'll be back down there
     personally to thank him for this baby.

[305188]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
CC:  Sure will. I did.

[305421]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
LMP: Okay. The Earth went by there, Jack, at LPD
     about 18 degrees.

[305428]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
CC:  Roger. We copy 18 degrees for the center of the
     Earth.

[305636]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
LMP: Okay. The Moon - I'd estimate it up around
     minus - somewhere 17 to minus 20 degrees LPD.

[305647]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
CC:  Okay. Moon's minus 17 to minus 20.

[305714]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
CC:  How would you like to spend a week on an 
     aircraft carrier getting back?

[305728]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
LMP: If I can get on an aircraft carrier, I don't
     care how long it takes, Jack.

[305788]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
CC:  They're going to take you by helo to Samoa.
     You'll spend the night in Samoa, get on a 141,
     and be at Ellington shortly thereafter.

[305806]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
LMP: Okay. Kind of sounds like the original plans
     for the ...

[305844]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
CC: Had you worrying that you're going to spend the
     night on the ship, helo to Samoa and directly to Ellington.

[305855]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
LMP: Very good.

[305907]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
LMP: Boy, these thrusters are sure ......

[305915]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
CC:  Fred, I'm not reading you. Maybe we'd better
     wait until we change antennas or unless you can
     speak up a little louder.

[305923]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
LMP: How do you read now?

[305925]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
CC:  Better.

[305929]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
LMP: Okay. The thrusters ... and the ... outside ...
     and they hardly look like they ......

[305952]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
CC:  Gee, I'm sorry, Fred. We're just not reading you
     right now. Maybe we'll have to wait a little bit.

[305960]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
LMP: Okay.

[305969]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
CC:  Let's try it now. If you can speak up, thc 
     background noise has gone down a little bit.

[305977]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
LMP: Okay. How do you read now?

[305979]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
CC:  A little better.

[305984]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
LMP: I was just commenting - I've been looking here
     at the thrusters on quads 1 and 4. We've got a
     slight discoloration on the outside of the barrel.
     The nozzles look like they hadn't ever been
     fired, - like they're brand new .... of like
     those skinny things on the interior on the upper
     nozzle ...

[306014]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
CC:  You say the coloration of the thrusters appears
     they haven't been fired on quads 1 and 4?

[306024]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
LMP: I'm saying all of them look clean again. I guess
     they've fired so clean that they don't seem to ...
     at all .... different color, ... copper, bronze,
     color of the oxygen cell. They've been fired because I watched 
     them fire. Okay. The Earth's going by at an LPD of 42.

[306058]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
CC:  Roger. Copy LPD 42. Is that affirm?

[306063]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
LMP: That's affirm.

[306077]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
CC:  And, Fred, that may be why the COMM is a little
     bit degraded, more background noise, because
     we're getting out of attitude a little bit there.

[306088]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
LMP: Roger.

[306218]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
LMP: How do you read on AFT OMNI now ...?

[306223]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
CC:  I'm reading you, Fred. I've got a lot of 
     background noise. Looks like it might come and go
     with attitude.

[306234]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
LMP: Yes. I think that's probably - just looking
     through the command module at you now.

[306287]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
CC:  About the same, Fred.

[306292]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
LMP: Okay.

[306308]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
LMP: Okay. And the Moon just went by at about
     minus 14 degrees.

[306313]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
CC:  Okay, the Moon at minus ]4.

[306324]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
LMP: That - that's correct.

[306328]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
CC:  Okay. Your landing in - your weather in the
     landing area, which is about 560 miles south of
     Samoa, is now predicted to be about 1500,
     scattered, high broken. Waves are going to be
     5 feet, the winds are going to be 15 knots,
     visibility 20 miles, showers in less than 10 percent of the 
     area, and you will be landing at 08:00 local, roughly.

[306364]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
LMP: Hey, that all sounds pretty good.

[306509]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
CC:  Say, Fred, did you get the dope on the Saturn IV
     impact - S-IVB impact?

[306521]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
LMP: Yes. Just as we came around the corner, Vance,
     they told us that it hit - I don't recall the
     position now, but it was a ... impact ... and
     recorded it on the ... seismometer.

[306544]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
CC:  Yes. It impacted 74 nautical miles from the ALSEP
     and the passive seismic detected major seismic
     activity on all long period channels and this
     was - this activity was detected for 4 hours
     afterwards with decreaing amplitude. And the
     impact also was detected by the high-energy
     channels ... The high-energy channel of the
     SIDE.

[306598]
_page : 395
_tape : Tape 56/10
_extra : END OF TAPE
LMP: Yes. That ought to add ...

[306702]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
LMP: Okay. The Earth LPD number that time was 32.

[306708]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
CC:  Roger. Thirty-two.

[306897]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
LMP: How do you read now, Jack?

[306902]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
CC:  I'm reading you, Fred. I've got a lot of
     background noise, though.

[306908]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
LMP: Jack, I can definitely tell we're moving away
     from the Moon, now. I got it all in the
     monocular at one time. We're right over the
     top of FPA 8 right now.

[306923]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
CC:  You're right over the top of what?

[306924]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
LMP: On a point between it and Censorinus - FPA 8 and -
     the point halfway between there and Censorinus.

[306946]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
CC:  Fred-o, would say the checkpoint over which
     you're right now?

[306956]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
LMP: Okay. And incidentally, the DELTA-V on the
     Moon was zero, so it's coming back down. The
     point looks like we're just about straight over
     is around Censorinus and the point between it
     and FPA 8.

[306979]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
CC:  Okay.

[307327]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
LMP: Okay. And, Jack, the Earth LPD angle is
     24 degrees.

[307334]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
CC:  Roger. Earth at 24. And it looks like you're
     getting up to about 15 on the C02, so we want
     you to select SECONDARY and swap out the primary
     cartridge. Over.

[307350]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
LMP: Okay. I'll select SECONDARY and swap out the
     primary cartridge.

[307373]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
CC:  Okay, Fred. And when you select - When you
     swap out the primary cartridge, don't reselect
     PRIMARY. Stay on SECONDAARY until we use the
     secondary up. Over.

[307390]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
LMP: Okay. I'm changing out primary and - stay in
     SECONDARY until we use it up.

[307783]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
LMP: And the change out is complete, Jack.

[307790]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
CC:  Okay. Copy the changeout complete, and we're
     reading 4.5 on the C02 here.

[307801]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
LMP: Okay. I'm ...

[307941]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
LMP: Okay. And the Earth LPD was 8 degrees.

[307945]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
CC:  Did you - Did you say 8 degrees, Fred?

[307951]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
LMP: Affirmative.

[307954]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
CC:  Okay.

[308212]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
LMP: Well, I missed the Moon on that one, Jack. But
     I would guess - estimating back a little bit,
     the LPD angle was somewhere around 42.

[308223]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
CC:  Fred, I'm having a hard time reading you, but I
     think you're giving me a LPD angle.

[308232]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
LMP: Roger. That's it s Jack. The Moon is about 42.

[308236]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
CC:  You say the Moon is at 22?

[308243]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
LMP: Four two, 42.

[308244]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
CC:  Okay, 4 2. Thank you.

[309027]
_page : 397

[309051]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
CC:  Okay, Fred. I can just barely hear you saying
     something in the background and I can't make out
     what it is.

[309062]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
CDR: Hello, Houston; Aquarius.

[309066]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
CC:  Hello there, Aquarius. Oo ahead.

[309071]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
CDR: Roger. And Fred is being relieved now. He's -
     went back to get some rest. This is Lovell here
     who's got the duty.

[309081]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
CC:  Gee whiz. You got up kind of early, didn't you?

[309088]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
CDR: It's cold back there in the command module.

[309098]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CC: Well, what we were really thinking about doing
     was letting you sleep a little bit longer
     because we figure you're pretty worn out.

[309115]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CDR: Well, I'll go back and forth once in a while to
     get a ...

[309121]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CC:  Is Jack up there with you?

[309128]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CDR: No, Jack's still sacked out.

[309161]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CC:  Okay, Jim. We're kind of watching this PTC a
     little bit. Fred's been giving us a few LPD
     angles as we swang by the center of the Earth -
     center of the Moon. We noticed that the COMM
     has been degrading Just a little bit so you
     might have to talk up.

[309189]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CDR: Roger. Understand.

[309191]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CC:  And we just went on to the secondary CO<sub>2</sub>
     canister. Fred swapped out the primary, but we
     want to stay on the secondary until it is all
     used up.

[309210]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CDR: Okay. I'm going to use the tape ... CO<sub>2</sub>.

[309222]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CC:  We're reading a partial pressure CO<sub>2</sub> of 4.2 millimeters.
     We're cleared to use the secondary until
     it reaches 15.

[309237]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CDR: Okay. That's good.

[309707]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CC:  Aquarius, in comparing our initial estimates of
     water usage and electrical power usage, it appears
     that we're right on the money on water usage, and
     we're using a little less amperes than we had
     originally expected in our first analysis, so we're
     either right on the money or just a little bit
     ahead of the game in that regard.

[309738]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CDR: Well, that sounds encouraging, Jack.

[309744]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CC:  And there are a few temperatures that we're
     watching for you. You have the heaters powered
     down. We're looking at them, and those include
     the PIPAs, the ASA, the quad temps, and your
     propellants, except for the DPS propellant.

[309769]
_page : 399
_tape : Tape 57/4
CDR: Okay. I've got them here.

[309782]
_page : 399
_tape : Tape 57/4
CC:  We have, as you probably know, several groups
     working on procedures from here on out. We
     have a group working on midcourse corrections
     to determine a system, the attitudes, how to do
     it, alinement techniques, and so forth. We have
     a group working on the entry, including how
     and when we're going to activate the CSM. We
     have a group working on the CSM system status,
     and in a few hours - Later on tomorrow, from
     where we see it, we're going to go to some base
     configuration on the CSM and we're going to
     conduct a MAIN BUS B check. Right now the COMM
     is kind of degrading, and I can't hear what
     you're about to say very well. But I just want
     to keep you advised as to how things are going
     here. And remember you've got duty on the
     antennas.

[309900]
_page : 399
_tape : Tape 57/4
CC:  Aquarius, are you reading Houston?

[309904]
_page : 399
_tape : Tape 57/4
CDR: ...

[309910]
_page : 399
_tape : Tape 57/4
CC:  Okay, Jim. I can hear you talking but I can't
     tell what you're saying because you're way down
     in the background noise.

[309920]
_page : 399
_tape : Tape 57/4
CDR: Okay. Can you hear Aquarius now? Over.

[309923]
_page : 399
_tape : Tape 57/4
CC:  Oh, yes. That's much better. Did you get my
     report on the various types of people and what
     they're doing around here?

[309930]
_page : 399
_tape : Tape 57/4
CDR: Roger. Sounds like you had things well organized.
     You might also consider what kind of a stowage
     configuration ... and what we can leave behind
     in Aquarius.

[309950]
_page : 399
_tape : Tape 57/4
CC:  Okay, Jim. I didn't catch that suggestion on
     account of the background noise; maybe we can
     pass it on when it gets more favorable.

[309967]
_page : 399
_tape : Tape 57/4
CDR: I'm thinking in terms of stowage. Whether we
     would leave the suit .... the Hycon camera in
     Aquarius, prior to ...

[309986]
_page : 399
_tape : Tape 57/4
CC:  Okay. I heard you say something about using the
     Hycon camera in Aquarius.

[309996]
_page : 400
_tape : Tape 57/5
CDR: Negative, Jack. I'm thinking of reentry stowage
     attitude. Whether we should - what we should
     leave behind in Aquarius. Leave the suits behind;
     leaving such big items as the Hycon cameras in
     Aquarius. Over.

[310013]
_page : 400
_tape : Tape 57/5
CC:  Oh, understand. You're thinking about stowage.
     What'll we leave behind in Aquarius when we fall
     back into Odyssey. Is that right?

[310024]
_page : 400
_tape : Tape 57/5
CDR: That's affirmative.

[310026]
_page : 400
_tape : Tape 57/5
CC:  Okay. We've people working on that, too.

[310046]
_page : 400
_tape : Tape 57/5
CC:  And we presently are tracking you at 22 500 miles
     from the Moon, moving out at 4400 feet a second.

[310063]
_page : 400
_tape : Tape 57/5
CDR: Aquarius. Roger.

[310236]
_page : 400
_tape : Tape 57/5
CC:  And, Jim, earlier in the evening, we thought there
     was a misunderstanding about the amount of potable
     water you can drink, but we want to advise you
     that you can drink as much water as you want to.
     There's 38 pounds in the potable tank, and that's
     about all you'll need. The doctors suggest you
     drink as much fruit juices as you want, too.

[310262]
_page : 400
_tape : Tape 57/5
CDR: Roger, Jack.

[310432]
_page : 400
_tape : Tape 57/5
CC:  Jim, earlier in the evening, Fred-o reported some
     venting out of window number 1 in the command
     module. He also reported a piece of loose metal
     about 4 inches square, silver, floating by, and
     one thing we were trying to establish is whether
     or not this is a new venting or whether this is
     part of the residual venting of our original
     problem. Do you have any more words or comments?
     And one thing he was doing was taking some
     photographs and we authorized photographs,
     targets of opportunity, using the lunar-surface
     camera number 1, and use the setting of 1/250 of
     a second, and not knowing precisely what f-stop to
     use, we suggested taking three of each, using
     settings of f:4, f:5.6, and f:8. Over.

[310497]
_page : 400
_tape : Tape 57/5
CDR: Roger, Jack. The ventirg really seems to ... I
     reported earlier, I also spotted the large piece
     go by and prior to our ... burn ... The venting
     you see now is much greater ... went into the
     dark mode, you could easily distinguish stars
     and didn't have the bright articles and bright
     objects, and I also have the camera hhere to take
     photographs. ...

[310569]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CC:  Okay, Jim. Once again I hear you talking hack
     there but I can only pick out a few words; maybe
     we'll have a better time.

[310614]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CC:  Aquarius, we're trying to improve our communications.
     Could you turn the BIOMED off and give us
     a voice check, please?

[310629]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CDR: Voice check follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1;
     voice check out.

[310638]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CC:  Okay, Jim. That seemed to be better.

[311462]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CC:  How are you doing there, Aquarius?

[311468]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CDR: We're doing good, Jack.

[311470]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CC:  Okay. Sometime when you get two guys available
     there and you could construct one of these
     lithium hydroxide rigs, I'd like to have you get
     the materials together, and we'll go through the
     steps together.

[311488]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CDR: Okay. Sounds good. And how do you read me now?

[311493]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CC:  Well, there is a lot of background noise, and
     sometimes it is worse than others and right now
     I hear you better than I have in the past.

[311505]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CDR: Okay, Jack. I'm kind of curious the amount of
     perturbations our PTC attitude is taking. I
     notice that we are getting off attitude, and I'm
     Just kind of curious how far we can let this go.

[311523]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CC:  We were tracking the attitudes with Fred earlier
     and it looked like what we were doing was oscillating
     about some point, but coming back. Are
     you detecting some kind of divergence now?

[311541]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CDR: Not too much. I notice that it's different than
     when I went to sleep. We are more at an angle
     now with the terminator of the Earth, so when we
     started out, we were just about parallel with
     the terminator, and now we are canted off somewhat.
     I haven't seen any trends, though, of going back
     and forth.

[311588]
_page : 402
_tape : Tape 57/7
CC:  And, Jim, our current plan is to not correct the
     PTC. We're going to take whatever we get and
     live with it. And we can kind of keep track of
     what's going on a little better if when you
     swing past the Earth and swing past the center
     of the Moon, if you could read off the LPD
     angles for the center of the Earth and the center
     of the Moon. Over.

[311614]
_page : 402
_tape : Tape 57/7
CDR: Roger. Will do, Jack. And I'm looking into the
     AOT now to the right - No, the number 4 detent,
     and we are venting something back there; I can
     see particles moving on past the command module.
     What it is, I don't knew.

[311639]
_page : 402
_tape : Tape 57/7
CC:  Okay. Can you identify the quadrant?

[311658]
_page : 402
_tape : Tape 57/7
CDR: Well, I'm looking through the right rear reticle
     now of the AOT, and when I was back in the command
     mmodule, I could see it out of the CM 1 window.
     The particles are rather small, but they are
     coming out with some force. That's probably what
     is disturbing our PTC attitude.

[311690]
_page : 402
_tape : Tape 57/7
CC:  Yes, that sounds quite probable, Jim. That's
     about the same report we got from Fred, but we
     haven't been able to identify what they might be
     and probably won't be able to until we crank up
     the CSM. If there's any change in that status,
     why, we just want to keep advised of it.

[311711]
_page : 402
_tape : Tape 57/7
CDR: Roger. Understand.

[311769]
_page : 402
_tape : Tape 57/7
CC:  And, Aquarius, we are setting a pretty good vector
     on you now. And it looks like you're a little
     bit outside of the corridor. We're looking at a
     7-foot-per-second midcourse at 104 hours. We
     are going to come up with an entry interface minus
     8 pad to use in the event of a loss of COMM situation

[311799]
_page : 402
_tape : Tape 57/7
CDR: Roger. Understand, and I hope you have that procedure for attitude.

[311808]
_page : 402
_tape : Tape 57/7
CC:  We are ginning up a procedure for attitude for
     you, Jim. For the no-COMM case, it may be a
     little different than what the guys working on
     the procedures come up with for the burn at
     104 hours.

[311829]
_page : 402
_tape : Tape 57/7
CDR: Roger.

[311856]
_page : 403
_tape : Tape 57/8
CC:  What I'm saying, Jim, is the guys who are
     working on this attitude situation for the burns
     haven't made their final conclusions yet, but in
     the interim period, we want to come up with
     something you can use, in the event that you
     lose COMM.

[311873]

CC:  Okay. Twenty-two degrees, and looks like we've
     come up with a procedure for the attitude control
     on the upcoming burns. Probably the ones that
     we'll use from here on out.

[312863]

CDR: Okay.

[313163]
_page : 404
_tape : 58/1
CDR: Jack, on the first of the LPD angles is about a
     minus 2 degrees and Just slightly above the top
     line.

[313176]
_page : 404
_tape : 58/1
CC:  Okay. Just went by minus 2 degrees. Is that on
     the Earth?

[313183]
_page : 404
_tape : 58/1
CDR: That's the Earth. Now, I don't know whether
     we're oscillating back and forth or not, Jack,
     or whether it's a continual motion. We'll have
     to see here.

[313192]
_page : 404
_tape : 58/1
CC:  Roger.

[313355]
_page : 404
_tape : 58/1
CDR: Okay, Jack. The Moon now has an LPD angle of
     10 degrees

[313381]
_page : 404
_tape : 58/1
CC:  Roger. The Moon at 10 degrees.

[313464]
_page : 405
_tape : 58/2
_extra : burn, I'd like to say that we're going
CC:  Okay, Jim. Just as kind of a lead-in to this
     procedure that we're going to use for the mid-course
     to use AGS and it's going to be a manual burn.
     The attitude will be controlled manually; the
     start/stop on the engine will be controlled manually.
     So we have a pretty good vector on you
     now, and it turns out you're coming in a little
     bit too shallow. So what that means is we're
     going to make our burn to come in a little more
     steeply, and we're going to be coming in around
     the dark side of the Earth. Therefore, to come
     in more steep, our thrust should be in the direction
     of the Sun. Does that all make sense
     to you?

[313529]
_page : 405
_tape : 58/2
CDR: I think so. We're going to use AGS for a burn
     monitor. The burns are going to be manual, and
     they're going to be started manually and stopped
     manually.

[313540]
_page : 405
_tape : 58/2
CC:  Okay. And your reentry is around the dark side
     of the Earth, and since we're coming in shallow,
     we're going to have to burn toward the Sun to
     make it steeper. Do you follow that?

[313565]
_page : 405
_tape : 58/2
CDR: That's affirm. Especially these burns will be
     perpendicular to our flight path and to the Sun
     giving a steeper entry angle.

[313588]
_page : 405
_tape : 58/2
CC:  Okay, Jim. I heard you say perpendicular to
     your flight path, which is affirmative, and I
     didn't get the rest of your statement.

[313606]
_page : 405
_tape : 58/2
CDR: I understand the technique, Jack. We're burning
     to give us time to steepen our entry angle, and
     it will be perpendicular to our flight path for
     corridor control.

[313621]
_page : 405
_tape : 58/2
CC:  Okay. That's affirmative. So, in general terms,
     what we're going to have to do is to power up
     the AGS and bring up the AGS eight-ball, and
     then to set up your attitude, put the COAS in
     the front window, and guidance control will be
     in AGS, of course. But manually orient the
     spacecraft to place the center of the Earth
     directly out the Z-axis. Then rotate about the
     Z-axis to place the point of the crescent on the
     Y-axis of the COAS. And this will have your
     plus X-axis in the direction of the Sun as we
     discussed before. So the crescent will be up
     with the point down. Copy that?

[313699]
_page : 406
_tape : Tape 58/3
_extra : to get our X-axis pointing toward the Sun.
CDR: Okay, Jack. We'll have to go over what again.
     The COAS will be out front window; we'll place
     the Earth in the center of the COAS, and, let's
     see, the center of the Earth right now is parallel
     to the LPD which is about parallel to our
     X-axis. And we'll have to rotate about 90 degrees

[313754]
_page : 406
_tape : Tape 58/3
CC:  Okay, Jim. So we want to get the Y-axis of the
     spacecraft parallel to the terminator by putting
     the points of the crescent on the Y-axis.

[313775]
_page : 406
_tape : Tape 58/3
CDR: Roger. Understand.

[313797]
_page : 406
_tape : Tape 58/3
CDR: Seriously, Jack, when I stop the spacecraft
     looking at - at the Earth, I'm going to have to
     roll - in LM terms, roll the spacecraft 90 degrees
     to get the tip of the Earth all on the
     Y-axis.

[313845]
_page : 406
_tape : Tape 58/3
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. You're going to have
     to roll 90 degrees to point your plus X-axis at
     the Sun and put the crescent - the points of
     the crescent on the Y-axis. The points of the
     crescent on the Y-axis with the COAS pointed at
     the center of the Earth will take care of your
     yaw and your pitch.

[313876]
_page : 406
_tape : Tape 58/3
CDR: Roger.

[313898]
_page : 406
_tape : Tape 58/3
CC:  Okay, Jim. After you get that orientation to
     come in a little more steeply, we perform an
     AGS body-axis aline which is at 400 plus 5 on
     the DEDA. If the AGS ball is up at this time,
     the AGS ball will go to 000. We can talk more
     about control modes later, but we'd recommend
     doing this, of course, in AGS ATTITUDE HOLD -
     ATTITUDE HOLD. Put your YAW to MODE CONTROL and
     leave PITCH and ROLL in PULSE, therefore, controlling
     your attitude with the TTCA. We don't
     want to use the gimbal, so have ENGINE GIMBAL
     OFF. We'll make these burns at 10-percent
     thrust. We'll use a manual start and stop. For
     ullage, we'll use the PLUS-X TRANSLATIONAL
     button, and ullage will be for 10 seconds. Over.

[313986]
_page : 406
_tape : Tape 58/3
CDR: Okay. I understand what you're saying, but
     you'll have to repeat it here.

[313995]
_page : 407
_tape : Tape 58/4
CC: Okay. We'll perform the burn in GUIDANCE CONTROL
     to AGS. And MODE CONTROL to ATTITUDE HOLD.
     Your ATTITUDE CONTROL switches will be ROLL to
     PULSE, PITCH to PULSE, and YAW to MODE CONTROL.
     So the AGS will control your yaw and you will
     use the TTCA to control pitch and roll. ENGINE
     GIMBAL OFF; 10-percent thrust. Start and stop
     manual. For ullage, use the plus-X translational
     button; 10 seconds ullage. Over.

[314085]
_page : 407
_tape : Tape 58/4
CDR: Okay. For the burn there will be go to GUIDANCE
     CONTROL AGS, MODE CONTROL ATT HOLD, ATTITUDE
     CONTROL switches will be ROLL PULSE, PITCH PULSE,
     YAW MODE CONTROL. We'll use TTCA control for
     pitch and roll. ENGINE GIMBAL will be OFF; we'll
     be using 10-percent thrust; we'll start and stop
     manually, the ... control ullage will be a PLUS-X
     TRANSLATIONAL button. And also our thrust will
     still be, but before that we are going to do an
     AGS aline ... ball ...

[314126]
_page : 407
_tape : Tape 58/4
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. After you get oriented
     in the attitude you want to burn in, do an AGS
     aline which is - an AGS body-axis aline which is
     400 plus 5. When you get ENTER, this will bring
     ball up to 000, and I want to confirm that you -
     that you said ENGINE GIMBAL OFF. 0-F-F. Over.

[314152]
_page : 407
_tape : Tape 58/4
CDR: Roger. Confirm that ENGINE GIMBAL will be off.

[314171]
_page : 407
_tape : Tape 58/4
CDR: And, Jack, how long do you estimate the length
     of the burns will be?

[314177]
_page : 407
_tape : Tape 58/4
CC:  Okay. The length of the burns are going to be
     probably less than a minute. And we want you
     to have cut-off based on time. So we will give
     you a burn time. And I have a P30 maneuver pad
     for midcourse-7 in the event that we lose COMM
     if you are ready to copy.

     event of lost COMM, use the procedures that I
     gave you. It may be that between now and tomorrow
     these procedures will change a little bit,
     so we'll go with what we've got now, and stand

     after you do the 400 plus 5, you should do a
     400 plus all balls. And one other point we
     want to clarify is that we know that youtre sure
     that this burn will be made with the plus X-axis
     pointing at the Sun to make the entry angle
     steeper. You got it?

[314830]
_page : 409
_tape : Tape 59/1
CDR: That's right, Jack. What I'm going to do is -
     We'll stop with the Earth in the commander's
     window, the COAS down, and then I'm going to
     maneuver the spacecraft so that I have the
     lighted portion of the Earth at the top of the
     window; that is, the COAS will be along the
     plus-Y of the spacecraft and the top of the
     window - of the rendezvous window, I should be
     looking into the Sun. That means I'll be burning
     towards the Sun and steepening the angle.

[314883]
_page : 409
_tape : Tape 59/1
CC:  That's affirm, Jim. I - You got the attitude
     right, and did you copy about doing a 400 plus

[315720]
_page : 411
_tape : Tape 60/1
CDR: Okay, Jack. Let's just talk over how I'm going
     to get to the attitude aad then do the burn.
     What I'm talking about is the control techniques.
     The way it looks now I'll try to stop the spacecraft
     in yaw with the Earth out my window, then
     we'll be in GUIDANCE or we'll be AGS CONTROL;
     we'll be in - yaw will be in MODE CONTROL. Then
     we'll be using the TTCAs to control the pitch and
     then control the roll. I don't see another way
     we can control the combination that we have here
     without using the TTCAs. Then we will also use
     the TTCA during engine burn. Do you people concur with that technique?

[315785]
_page : 411
_tape : Tape 60/1
CC:  Jim, that sounds like the one that is best to
     use to me. Let me talk it over with the rest of
     the guys here, and we'll advise you.

[315796]
_page : 411
_tape : Tape 60/1
CDR: Okay.

[316003]
_page : 411
_tape : Tape 60/1
CC:  Jim, in that control mode, that sounds like the
     best way to go. The only thing you'll have to
     do is to get ATTITUDE HOLD in the AGS, and so
     before you start to maneuver, you'll have to
     bring the AGS up, and get a 400 plus all zeros
     in there, and then AGS will respond in yaw when
     you go to MODE CONTROL. That is, AGS will control
     your yaw in MODE CONTROL and your pitch and
     roll can be taken care of in PULSE with a TTCA.
     After you get in attitude, then, you'll have to
     re-do an AGS body axis aline which is 400 plus
     5, then go back to 400 plus all zeros again.

[316056]
_page : 411
_tape : Tape 60/1
CDR: Right, Jack. That was my next question. I don't
     want to aline the AGS ball 000 until I am in position,
     so we use that as a primary attitude burn
     monitor device.

[316085]
_page : 411
_tape : Tape 60/1
CC:  And, Jim, you can do a 400 plus all zeros any
     time you want to; that just tells the AGS that
     you want it to control your attitude should you
     go to ATTITUDE HOLD in MODE CONTROL.

[316099]
_page : 412
_tape : Tape 60/2
CDR: Roger. I understand, but after we get to the
     attitude, we'll do a 400 plus 5 to get the AGS
     aline ball, and then we'll do a 400 plus zero.

[316111]
_page : 412
_tape : Tape 60/2
CC:  Affirmative.

[316154]
_page : 412
_tape : Tape 60/2
CC:  Another thing, Jim, is while you're maneuvering
     to that attitude using AGS to control your yaw,
     if you find out enroute to that attitude that
     you didn't quite have the yaw where you wanted
     it to be, you can use your ACA and tweak up the
     yaw, and your AGS needles go right back to zero
     because you zero the attitude errors.

[316186]

[318323]
_page : 413
_tape : Tape 60/3
CDR: Okay, Jack. It appears that we're going - funny
     diversion here, the PTC attitude in - in pitch.
     I'm going to do a LPD check now, but the last
     time the Moon went around, it was above - way
     away above the LPD angle and I see the Earth
     coming around now which is going to be pretty
     low. They oscillate back and forth, but each
     time they seem to get a little farther away from
     the center line. You might think of some procedure
     to reestablish PTC, if it's necessary.

[318362]
_page : 413
_tape : Tape 60/3
CC:  Okay.

[318429]
_page : 414
_tape : Tape 60/1
CC:  Jim, the only way we know of getting the as good
     or a better PTC than you've got right now is to
     crank up the G & N and we - We don't want to do
     that. So our plan is to just take whatever we
     get out of this, and later on, it may turn out
     by the time you get to burn attitude, you'll be
     right where you want to be.

[318457]

     this midcourse at 1077

[318651]

_tape : Tape 60/1

[318666]
_page : 414
_tape : Tape 60/1
CC:  The only thing we can try to do, Jim, is to get
     the thing up manually and see what happens.
     Thcre must be a better answer than that - -

[318677]
_page : 414
_tape : Tape 60/1
CDR: Okay.

[318678]
_page : 414
_tape : Tape 60/1
CC:  - - and one course of action is to omit the midcourse
     and make a total midcourse, say, about
     8 hours before entry. We haven't decided yet.

[318697]
_page : 414
_tape : Tape 60/1
CC:  Right now we're talking about a 7-foot-per-second
     midcourse at 104 hours. And extrapolate that
     down to about 8 hours before entry. We gave you
     a pad for that - that's about, only 19 feet per
     second, so if it doesn't change too much - and
     we can get all kinds of DPS.

     that might occur like maybe - a hydrogen tank
     that's over-pressurized relieving in the window?

[320131]
_page : 414
_tape : Tape 60/1
CC:  Yes, we thought of that, Jim.

[320152]
_page : 415
_tape : Tape 60/5
CC: That is one possibility that we've though of, Jim, because -
     We heated up that tank, and we haven't been using any hydrogen
     and, therefore, it could be venting in the overboard release.

[320170]
_page : 415
_tape : Tape 60/5
CDR: Right. The only other thing I can think of when
     I look at it through the AOT is - it did appear
     to be coming from one spot; but that's the only
     difference although I can't see where it is coming
     from because it's beyond the curvature of
     the command module. But, it appears like it might
     be coming from more than this one spot.

[320194]
_page : 415
_tape : Tape 60/5
CC:  Okay. Thank you. We hope that when we crank up
     the command module tomorrow that we'll be able
     to - or later on today - that we will be able to
     identify more closely what it's been coming from.
     But, the guidance guys say that they haven't been
     able to see the results of any venting in their
     data and it would take a very, very small amount
     to perturb their data.

     about an hour ago. I suppose you've taken care
     of that. The other thing is we're kind of interested
     in knowing how long you're going to be
     at stick there, or if you're going to go back to
     bed or what?

[320772]
_page : 415
_tape : Tape 60/5
CDR: Okay, Jack. We're - We're going to set up a
     regular watch and sleep period here. Fred was
     up for a long time, so I got up a little bit
     early to relieve him. Jack and Fred are now
     asleep, so I'm going to let them sleep as long
     as they can, and then we'll have an eat period
     and then I'll go back to bed for a bit. And
     we'll separate the schedule.

[320800]
_page : 416
_tape : Tape 60/6
CC:  Okay. We're right at the point now where,
     according to the flight plan that we had made
     up for you, that you would have all finished
     eating and you and Jack would have the duty
     while Fred went to sleep. So, essentially,
     according to the plan we've got, you got up about
     3 or 4 hours early. And - The next time that we
     have that as a rest period for you is at 96 hours,
     which is 7 hours from now, and an hour before
     that, say at 95 hours, all three of you would eat,
     and then you and Jack would hit the sack again
     and Fred would have the duty until 102 hours.
     We'd be glad to take care of this work-rest cycle
     for you.

[320860]
_page : 416
_tape : Tape 60/6
CDR: Okay. That's good. Let me - Let me wait until
     they get up, or at least Jack gets up. He should
     be getting up before Fred. And we'll try to get
     back on the schedule. I hate to wake everybody
     up right now though, if they're sleeping.

[320874]
_page : 416
_tape : Tape 60/6
CC:  Okay. Your choice on that. As soon as Jack gets
     up, i'd suggest we go ahead and break up these
     lithium hydroxide canisters and make a couple of
     them. Jack could work on that. It's going to
     take four sets of hands, I think.

     and let us talk you through your procedure
     while you do it. Now, maybe you could give Jack
     the headset and - and - get the equipment together,
     and we'll talk you through the procedure.
     I think it'll be a little easier to do that way
     than if you tried to copy it all down - and then
     go do it.

[324551]
_page : 418
_tape : Tape 61/2

[324557]

     two command module lithium hydroxide canisters,
     a roll of the gray tape, the two LCGs, because
     we're going to use the bags from the LCGs, and
     one - one LM cue card - one of those cardboard
     cue cards which you will cut off about an inch
     and a half out from the ring. Now, i think that's
     all we'll need. Over.

[324653]
_page : 418
_tape : Tape 61/2
CC:  Okay. That's affirmative, Jim. If you'll just
     cut the cue card, which is a handy piece of
     stiff paper the right size, about an inch and a
     half from the rings. Just cut off the ring
     holes, in other words, and you'll have a card
     about 11 inches long and probably 6 inches wide,
     something like that.

CC:  Okay; right. Okay. I'm ready to start into
     the procedure. When you answer me back, speak
     up - speak wp into the microphone, because our
     downlink is pretty noisy. The first thing we
     want you to do, and we'll do this on one canister,
     and then let you go ahead and repeat it on
     the second. So take one of the LCGs and cut off
     the outer bag. By cutting along one the heat
     seals; do it carefully and close to the heat
     seal, because we may have to use the outer bag
     if we damage the inner bag. So go ahead and
     do that, and then we'll do the next step.

     cut about a 2-foot length off the roll and then
     tear it lengthwise so that you have two strips
     about 2 feet long and about a half an inch wide.
     And you'll wrap those around the canister at right
     angles, more or less, to the tape that you've got
     so that it goes across the top and across the
     bottom; and when it goes across the top and the
     bottom, put it so that it's outboard of the
     center hole and try to get it over one of the
     ridges between the screens, so that it won't
     block the flow. Is that clear? Over.

     That's right.

[326133]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CMP: ... hold that one right here, if I can set it.

[326248]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CMP: Okay, Joe; Aquarius. We've got that done.

[326252]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CC:  Okay, Jack. The next step is to get the EVA cue
     card and use it to form an arch over the top of
     the canister; just tuck one short end under one
     ridge on the top the other one against the ridge
     on the other side so that it forms a rounded
     arch over the top of the canister. You see,
     Jack, what we're going to do is slip the bag
     over this whole assembly and the cue card will
     serve to keep the bag from being sucked down
     against the screen. Over.

[326290]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CMP: Okay. I got the idea.

[326293]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CC:  Okay. And when you've done that, to hold the
     arch in place, just run a strip of tape across
     the side of the - that is, across the top of the
     arch, and anchor it down to the sticky strips
     along each side.

[326311]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CMP: Okay. I got the idea. Okay. Let me just repeat
     it here. Take a cue card, form an arch over the
     top, bringing it under the side here. When we're
     through, run a piece of tape from the sides across
     the top of that to anchor to the other side.

[326331]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CC:  That's correct.

[326336]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6

[326340]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CMP: The top .... Across the top.

[326358]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CMP: Looks like you're going to have to cut the cue
     card slightly.

[326372]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CMP: Doesn't have to be really ... over that the only
     thing we're ... we can just take the scissors and
     cut off the edge here. The only thing this does,
     Jim, is prevent this from being sucked down into
     the container.

[326428]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CMP: Still going to need some more tape. Cut off the
     end. Okay. Whack off the bottom ....

[326614]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CMP: Okay, Joe. We've got that arch built, and it's
     all taped in securely.

[326621]
_page : 423
_tape : Tape 61/7
CC: Okay, Jack. The next step is to stop up the
     bypass gole, which is the hole in the center of
     the bottom of the canister; we want to stop that
     up because we don't want to bypass the flow; and
     I forgot to tell you to get something to stick
     in that hole. We recommend that you either use
     a wetwipe, or cut off a piece of sock and stuff
     it in there, or you could probably even crumble
     up some tape and use that. Over.

[326653]
_page : 423
_tape : Tape 61/7
CMP: Okay. We'll start plugging up the bypass hole.

[326657]
_page : 423
_tape : Tape 61/7
CC: Okay.

[326658]
_page : 423
_tape : Tape 61/7
CMP: Plug that hole. We can either - we can put some
     either - Let's cut a piece of your towel there.

[326667]

_tape : Tape 61/7
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC: Sounds good.

[326834]
_page : 424
_tape : Tape 62/1
CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We have the bypass hole
     all plugged up.

[326841]
_page : 424
_tape : Tape 62/1
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. The next step is take the inner
     LCG bag that you cut open, and slip it over the
     top of the canister, when you do that, orient it
     so that the ears of the bag, that is, the corners
     should stick out on the closed end - are oriented
     along the open ends of the arch, because we're
     going to snip one of those corners to stick the
     hose in. Pull it down until it fits snugly over
     the arch. Over.

[326876]
_page : 424
_tape : Tape 62/1
CMP: Okay, Joe. Slip the bag over the canister so that
     the arch is at the bottom of the bag and that the
     ears are along oriented along, let's see - I guess
     it would be - would be at the sides of the arch.

[326899]
_page : 424
_tape : Tape 62/1
CC:  Depends on what you mean by sides - over the - the
     open ends of the arch.

[326906]
_page : 424
_tape : Tape 62/1
CMP: Right, the open ends of the arch.

[326908]
_page : 424
_tape : Tape 62/1
CC:  Okay.

[326957]
_page : 424
_tape : Tape 62/1
CMP: Okay, Joe. We've got that done.

[326960]
_page : 424
_tape : Tape 62/1
CC:  Okay. Now press the bag against the sticky belts
     that we put on the sides of the canister. If
     there is any excess material, just kind of pleat
     it, so that it makes a fairly tight seal, and then
     take another 3-foot strip of sticky tape and wrap
     it around the outside of the bag opposite the
     bottom - the bottom sticky belt - to make a nice
     tight seal.

[326990]
_page : 424
_tape : Tape 62/1
CMP: Okay. I'll do it. Okay. Now they want two
     strips around here to make a tight seal.

[327158]
_page : 424
_tape : Tape 62/1
CMP: Okay, Joe. We've got the canister inside the bag,
     two strips around the sides of the bag, real
     tight, and both sealed.

[327167]
_page : 424
_tape : Tape 62/1
CC:  Okay; real fine. Now there's probably a couple
     of inches of excess bag sticking our around the
     bottom of the canister. To prevent this from
     sucking in against the bottom screen, we'd like
     you to trim it off with the scissors, and when
     you've done that, we'd like you to cut two more
     strips of tape about 12 inches long or so, cut
     the - tear them lengthwise to get four pieces
     12 inches long and 1/2-inch wide, and then use
     those four strips to secure the bag by passing
     the strips from the sides of the canister outside
     the bag around the bottom of the canister and
     back up the other side, and when you do this,
     just as you did on the top, make them go outward
     of the hole and in between the screens. Over.

[327222]
_page : 425
_tape : Tape 62/2
CMP: Okay. You want me to trim the excess material
     that's sticking off here; trim it at the edge of
     that canister? Or do you want any excess left
     over?

[327232]
_page : 425
_tape : Tape 62/2
CC:  No, you don't need to have any excess. Just trim
     it approximately level.

[327239]
_page : 425
_tape : Tape 62/2
CMP: Okay. Let's do that first.

[327241]
_page : 425
_tape : Tape 62/2
CC:  Okay.

[327298]
_page : 425
_tape : Tape 62/2
CMP: Okay. Now, Joe, you want to cut four strips,
     12 inches long each, 1/2-inch in diameter. Tape
     that along the outsides of the bag across the
     ribs.

[327315]
_page : 425
_tape : Tape 62/2
CC:  That's correct, Jack. That's Just for additional
     security on the bag. When you get those done,
     you'll have - You'll have two strips going one
     way, and the other two will be perpendicular to
     them.

[327478]
_page : 425
_tape : Tape 62/2
CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We've got the four
     strips in place.

[327488]
_page : 425
_tape : Tape 62/2
CC:  Okay. We're in business now with the bag, and
     the next step to perform is to get ready to put
     the red suit hose, either the commander's or the
     LMP's because we're - we're going to want you to
     have both of these made up eventually, into the
     top of the - of the bag, and to do that you,
     first of all, have to assure that the - that the
     red hose is separated from the blue hose. I
     don't know whether this has been done already,
     but if it hasn't, what you have to do is cut the
     outer Beta-cloth sheath down the full length of
     the - of the hoses and then also cut the rubber
     ties that secure the two hoses together, and the
     hoses should come apart and the COMM cable
     should - should come off. Over.

[327544]
_page : 426
_tape : Tape 62/3
CMP: Okay. Take the  - I'm going to want to separate
     the red hose from the blue hose by cutting this Beta-cloth sheah.
     Okay. That's in work.

[327555]
_page : 426
_tape : Tape 62/3
CC:  Okay.

[327652]
_page : 426
_tape : Tape 62/3
CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I have the LMP's red
     hose separated from the others.

[327660]
_page : 426
_tape : Tape 62/3
CC:  Okay. Real fine. Now the next step is to cut
     a diagonal hole in one ear of the - of the plastic
     bag near the arch. You can pick either one and
     cut about, a 1-1/2 or 2 inch diagonal hole, big
     enough to slip the red hose through. And when
     you've done that, you'll just slip the red hose
     through so that it goes about to the center of
     the canister. It's - it's - It's not critical
     except that the opening should be down, and then
     tape the bag to the hose wher'e it goes in so that
     it's nice and snug. Over.

[327700]
_page : 426
_tape : Tape 62/3
CMP: Okay. Copy that. We want a 1-1/2 inch hole
     right here at this ear, and put the hose in here,
     end down and toward the canister and then we
     tape the seal around here.

[327730]
_page : 426
_tape : Tape 62/3
CMP: Let's try it. We can always make it bigger if
     we have to. Fred, get those .... the center of
     the arch.

     the way to the center. No, no.

CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[328226]
_page : 426
_tape : Tape 62/3
CMP: Okay. Our do-it-yourself lithium hydroxide
     canister change is complete. Joe, the only thing
     different Js that our arch on this piece of cardboard
     is not big enough to position the red hose
     with the inlet down, and the inlet - the inlet
     to - to the red hose is lying on its side, but
     I think it'll still work.

[328253]
_page : 427
_tape : 62/4
CC:  Okayy, Jack. I concur. I think it'll work, too.
     There's one step that i omitted, which you can
     do now qulte conveniently, and it's this. Where
     you stuff the towel in the bypass hole on the
     bottom, we recommend that you cut a few short
     pieces of tape and just tape that over so it
     doesn't fall out. Over.

[328277]
_page : 427
_tape : 62/4
CMP: Okay. Will do. Jim, I've got one more little
     thing to do, and that's ... seal that top.

[328348]
_page : 427
_tape : 62/4
CMP: Okay, Joe. That's done.

[328350]
_page : 427
_tape : 62/4
CC:  Okay, Jack. Now the remaining steps are simply
     suit-loop configuration steps to get this thing
     into full operation, and our ECS people want to
     hold off on that until the canister you're working 
     on gets to 7.6 millimeters of mercury, which
     will probably be another 45 minutes or an hour -
     it - We're reading 4.7 now. So what we'd like
     you to do in the interim is to set up the second
     command module canister the same way you just did
     the first one, using the commander's hose, and
     get that all set and probably about that time
     it'll be time to - to switch over. For your information, 
     when you've got that done and if you've
     had your breakfast and so on, the next thing
     I've got for you is a switch-configuration list
     for the command module, which will represent the -
     the powerdown, square-1 starting configuration
     for all our - our preentry checks. Over.

[328419]
_page : 427
_tape : 62/4
CMP: Okay. We'll start setting up the commander's
     hose configuration the same as the LMP's hose.
     And I'll get - instead of - I guess you want me
     to use my launch ... - launch checklist which
     I'd ...

[328440]
_page : 427
_tape : 62/4
CC:  That's affirmative, Jack. What we have done is
     marked up the lift-off configuration checklist,
     and we'll run through it whenever you get around
     to it.

[328451]
_page : 427
_tape : 62/4
CMP: And, I assume that ...

[328478]
_page : 427
_tape : 62/4
CMP: What I'd better do is before I put this thing back
     in operation, they're going to complete that
     other canister. I don't know. It should be in
     operation now. ...

     now because it's already mounted on the hose?

[328517]
_page : 428
_tape : 62/5
CC: Well, yes. We haven't completely configured the
     suit loop to get full flow through there, and
     it's okay the way it is. What I recommend you
     do with the commander's hose is get the bag all
     ready, but not stick the hose in until we call
     you on it. Okay.

     circuit breaker, and the next one is LIGHTING:
     NUMERICS/INTEGRAL, LEB AC2, LMDC-AC1, and
     R MDC-ACI to closed, and that's one circuit
     breaker also.

[332966]
_page : 442
_tape : 63/4
CMP: Okay. I don't know whether I can read that all
     back. Okay, LIGHTING: NUMERIC/INTEGRAL and
     I didn't get the rest of it, Joe -

[332980]
_page : 442

     involved and they're all - they're the first
     six from the left on the bottom row of the panel.
     They're under LIGHTING. We want the three FLOOD
     circuit breakers out and the three NUMERIC/

     mean closed. Those six closed and the rest open.

     copy.

[333170]
_page : 443

     it all.

     panel.

[333548]
_page : 445
_tape : 63/7
CC:  Okay. You can get those configures when you
     can. And the next order of business I've got
     for you is a procedure to verify that MAIN BUS
     B is good. And a little after that, we'll want
     to read up to you, for your future information,
     a procedure for transferring LM power to the
     command module. Over.

[333573]
_page : 445
_tape : 63/7

     PLSS configuration done first before you give
     those other procedures, huh?

[333584]
_page : 445
_tape : 63/7
CC:  Yes, I think so. Stand by 1 second and I'll

     concern is that you'll wake up somebody; is
     there anybody sleeping right now?

[333637]
_page : 446
_tape : 63/8
CMP: No. We're all sitting here eating. I'm just
     going to get a bite to eat. Then I'll write
     down that switch configuration, or I'll copy
     the procedure now, if you want.

[333648]
_page : 446
_tape : 63/8
CC:  Yes, okay. Understand they are all up. Did
     you say you wanted to copy the other procedure
     now? Over.

[333657]
_page : 446
_tape : 63/8
CMP: I can if you want. It's your choice.

[333660]

_tape : 63/8

[333666]
_page : 446
_tape : 63/8

     you.

[333670]

     wants him to go to bed.

     FLIGHT has got one other item for you.

_page : 446
_tape : 63/8
CMP: You know what I thought - I think what we saw
     venting was the result of our DELTA-Vs stirring
     up things, popping the relief valve. Yes. We
     don't see anything venting now. ...

[333843]

CMP: Okay, Joe.

[333858]
_page : 447
_tape : 63/9
CC: Okay, Jack. You can go ahead and set up that
     switch configuration. What we are discussing
     is having you activate the MAIN BUS TIE motor
     switches a little later on simply to verify that
     they will be okay, because the batteries are
     probably getting a little bit cool. But we'll
     be back to you with a procedure and discussion
     about that after you get the switch configuration 
     set up. Over.

[333887]

_page : 447
_tape : 63/9
CC:  Okay, Jim. We are still gathering our thoughts
     on the MCC, but some of the considerations go
     like this: FIDO tells us that we can do that
     correction probably as late as 118 hours, with
     no significant DELTA-V penalty, and with plenty
     of tracking thereafter to make sure that we've
     done the right thing, and to set you up for a
     late MCC if we need it, which we probably
     wouldn't. We are happy with the PTC mode that
     you are in now, and, although we are working
     up a - an AGS PTC mode to use after the midcourse correction, we'd kind of like you to
     stay in this PTC for a while because it is
     doing good. We are looking at the weather in
     the landing area. We don't think we'll have
     a problem but we are checking it real close,
     and if there is any changing that we want to do,
     we want to get it into this midcourse correction.
     And for reasons like that, we are considering
     possibly delaying the midcourse correction from
     104 hours to some time between there and 118.
     We'd like to know what you think about it. Over.

[334053]
_page : 448
_tape : 63/10
CDR: We have no druthers. As long as we do the midcourse and there is plenty of tracking thereafter
     to correct for another midcourse; that's my only
     concern.

[334064]
_page : 448
_tape : 63/10
CC:  Okay, Jim. Roger that. And based on FIDO's
     input that he'd like to do it not later than
     24 hours before EI, we will be doing it prior
     to 118 hours.

[334077]
_page : 448
_tape : 63/10
CDR: Okay.

[334118]

LMP: Hello, Houston; Aquarius.

[334123]
_page : 448
_tape : 63/10
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go.

[334128]
_page : 448
_tape : 63/10
LMP: Question, Joe. Jim has been talking to me about
     how we are going to do this midcourse, and awhile
     back when we went through this power up, we had
     pulled the STAB/CONTROL ASA breaker. I was
     wondering - we lost the heaters in the ASA - I
     was wondering how it looked? What kind of shape
     it's going to be in?

[334158]
_page : 448
_tape : 63/10
CC: Okay. Stand by on that one, Fred.

[334164]
_page : 448
_tape : 63/10
LMP: Okay.

[334188]
_page : 448
_tape : 63/10
CC:  Fred, Houston.

[334192]
_page : 448
_tape : 63/10
LMP: Go ahead.

[334193]
_page : 448
_tape : 63/10
CC:  Roger. I am told that we'd see 38 degrees for
     that package, and it'll be okay for the burn.
     We're massaging the detail procedures for this
     burn at this time and we expect to have a real
     clean setup to you in plenty of time.

[334212]
_page : 448
_tape : 63/10
LMP: Okay, very good.

[334230]
_page : 448
_tape : 63/10
LMP: And I don't know if Jack passed it on to you,
     but Jack and I just finished logging about
     6 hours sleep, each.

[334251]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
CC: Roger, Fred. Copy that. Is it a little chilly
     up there?

[334258]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
LMP: Yes. We made the mistake of putting up the
     window shades, which we won't do again; and with
     this powered-down mode, we're not generating
     much internally, and it really did get chilly.

[334273]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
CC:  Yes. I guess you'll have to generate your own
     heat in there for a while.

CC:  Deke says unstow the Exer-Genie.

[334286]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
LMP: Okay.

[334667]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
CC: Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[334672]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[334674]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
CC: Fred, just wanted to let you know in advance
     that we're coming up on the redline CO<sub>2</sub> value
     for the secondary canister, and we expect to
     get there in something like a half hour, at
     which time we'll be asking you to switch over to
     the command module canisters. I have the rest
     of that procedure ready and I just wanted to
     warn you a little bit in advance. Over.

[334700]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
LMP: Okay. And I've got a question for you, Joe.

[334705]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
CC:  Go ahead.

[334711]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
LMP: Okay. The - I need to find out if the condensate
     container that we were going to use to strain
     some water in on the lunar surface - is that container 
     also completely airtight? Okay to use it
     to put fluid in through here in zero g?

[334741]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
CC:  Fred, I didn't copy what you wanted to use it
     for. Over.

[334749]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
LMP: ...

[334761]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
CC:  Fred, Houston. We'll have to stand by for
     1 minute. We are in a noisy state of COMM.

[334769]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
LMP: Okay. How do you read now, Joe?

[334771]
_page : 449
_tape : 63/11
_extra : 
CC:  Oh, that's much better. Go ahead.

[334776]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
LMP: Okay. I was just going to say we haven't had
     an overboard waste water dump since clear back
     around the other side of the Moon. About this
     time, we're running out of the bags we've got
     on board here.

[334803]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
CC: Okay. I'm - I'm stupid this morning, Fred. I'm
     not quite sure what you are getting at.

[334814]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
LMP: Okay, Joe. We need some place to put the urine.

[334818]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
CC:  Okay. It sounds to me as if the suggested receptacle 
     is perfectly satisfactory. Do you
     think you can use it in its present configuration?

[334834]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
LMP: Oh, yes. We got all the innerconnects - hookups
     we need, but I wasn't sure if that gadget was
     devised solely with the 1/6g environment in mind,
     and whether it might leak somehow in zero g.

[334850]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
CC:  I'll have them verify that, but off the top of
     my head, I'm sure it's going to be all right.
     We'll check it, Fred.

[334859]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
LMP: Okay.

[335122]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
LMP: Okay. How do you read, Joe?

[335513]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[335521]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[335526]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
LMP: Okay, Joe. One thing I've noticed, that a
     couple of circuits there now - the pulse ... -
     at least the number of them, is markedly decreased, and ... rather bad and, apparently, that
     added venting we had out of the service module
     was some overboard relief valve, maybe letting
     go, because it appears to have stopped now.

[335558]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
CC:  Okay, Fred. Copy that. Thank you.

[336194]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[336197]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[336204]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
LMP: What do you read down there for partial pressure
     CO<sub>2</sub>?

[336209]
_page : 450
_tape : 63/12
CC:  Oh, let's see. We're reading 6.6 right now,
     Fred. What do you read?

[336218]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
LMP: I'm reading about 12.5. I guess we've got a
     gage problem ... I did just get a MASTER ALARM 
     and no caution light; we kind of figured that's
     what it was, with CO<sub>2</sub> approaching its limit.
     Maybe it didn't quite come out here.

[336239]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
CC:  Okay. Let me get a go, and I think it's time
     for us to go ahead and put these other canisters
     on. Stand by 1.

[336248]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
LMP:  Okay. We went to 15 on the primary last night
     before 1 changed it and - -

[336256]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
CC: Roger that, Fred. We wanted to - -

[336258]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
LMP: - - I don't have a steady - I don't have a
     steady ECS light on at this time, Joe, so it
     must have just been a momentary.

[336268]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
CC:  Okay. We know when you went to 15 last night
     on primary. We want to switch out today at 7.6.
     Let me check and see if we're ready.

[336281]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
LMP: Okay.

[336313]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
LMP: Yes. That's what it is, Joe. I've got something
     going on this alarm ... ECS light.

[336324]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
CC: Fred, Houston. The COMM isn't too sharp and I
     didn't copy.

[336394]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
CC: Okay, Aquarius; Houston - -

[336397]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
LMP: Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?

[336398]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
CC:  - - Why don't you try it now? You're loud and
     clear now, Fred.

[336402]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
LMP: Okay. I was just - I'm getting MASTER ALARMS
     every few seconds and I am catching a glimmer
     now of the ECS light. For the time being, I
     have ... - ... open. Okay, now we got the ECS
     light on steady.

[336427]
_page : 451
_tape : 63/13
CC:  Okay. Copy that. You have the MASTER ALARM,
     with the ECS light. We are ready to go ahead
     and get you on the command module canisters.
     And as the first step, I'd like to know whether
     you've inserted the commander's red hose to the
     second canister bag. Over.
[336449]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
LMP: Okay. Yes. Sure enough; the commander's red
     hose is inserted into the canister bag.

[336459]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
CC:  Okay, Fred. The next thing I'd like you to do
     is to take some more gray tape and tape over
     half the outlet area of each of the blue nozzles;
     the commander's and the LMP's. The reason we're
     doing this is we're going to be running this loop
     through the secondary LiOH canister hole with
     the canister removed, and we don't have the flow
     restriction we need to keep the separator from
     overspeeding. Over.

[336491]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
LMP: Okay. Yes, that's right. So we want to tape
     over half of the - both the blue and the red
     commander hoses. Is that right?

[336502]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
CC:  Negative, Fred. That's half of the commander's
     blue hose and half of the LMP's blue hose - the
     outlet hoses.

[336511]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
LMP: Oh, okay. I'll tape over half of each of the
     outlets. Stand by.

[336517]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
CC:  Okay.

[336700]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
LMP: Okay. I'm going to turn off one suit flow valve
     at a time while I am doing the taping, Joe.

[336711]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
CC:  Say again, please, Fred.

[336716]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
LMP: Okay, while I'm doing the taping, I'll have that
     particular suit flow valve in the suit DISCONNECT 
     position momentarily.

[336723]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
CC:  Okay. Fine.

[337426]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
LMP: Okay. How do you read now, Joe?

[337429]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
CC:  Okay, Fred. Reasonable COMM. Are you ready for
     the next step? Over.

[337437]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
LMP: Okay. One correction - the red hose that's connected 
     up right now to the lithium cartridge in
     the LMP's - Wait a minute.

[337457]
_page : 452
_tape : 63/14
CC:  Okay, Fred. Understand only the LMP's red hose
     is actually plugged into the canister bag. In
     that case, we would like you to follow the procedure 
     for inserting the other red hose in the     other canister bag as follows: you cut a diagonal 
     hole in one corner of the bag. Look at the
     other bag and see how it was done. Stick the
     hose in about 6 inches. Try to get the outlet
     nozzle down if you can, or else sideways, and
     then just tape up the hose to the bag to make a
     nice tight seal. Over.

[337502]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
LMP: Okay. Jack's back in here. I guess he can do
     that. Stand by.

[337508]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
CC:  Okay.

[337558]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
LMP: How do you read, Joe?

[337560]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
CC:  Okay, Fred. Is that done? Over.

[337566]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
LMP: No. That's still in works. I just wanted to
     comment you might pass on to Steve Grega, we
     thank you a lot for those rendezvous procedures.
     They went to making up these little boxes.

[337589]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
CC:  Okay. We appreciate your appreciating it. We're
     just having a ball down here working on all kinds
     of new procedures, Fred. The CPCB is in session,
     and we expect to have your entry procedures out
     here by Saturday or Sunday at the very latest.

[337610]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
LMP: Saturday or Sunday?

[337612]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
CC:  At the very latest!

[337634]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
LMP: Take your time, Jack.

[337656]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
LMP: Why don't you run that other hose back up in the
     tunnel so Jim can get some air.

[337674]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
LMP: Yes. I got it.

[337912]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
LMP: And Joe, how you read now?

[337915]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
CC:  Satisfactory, Fred. Go ahead.

[337921]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
LMP: Okay. Back to the condensate container. I
     guess the only question I really need answered
     is will it leak?

[337931]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
CC:  Is will it leak? Oh, yes. Stand by 1.

[337942]
_page : 453
_tape : 63/15
LMP: And we've checked all the fittings and I know I
     can hook everything up to our UCDs. So, if it
     doesn't leak, we can transfer.
[337951]
_page : 454
_tape : 63/16
CC:  Okay, Fred. We still don't have a final answer
     on whether or not it'll leak. If you need it,
     I'd go ahead and use it; and standing by for
     your completion of the hose-insertion procedure.

[337972]
_page : 454
_tape : 63/16
LMP: Okay. The hose-insertion procedure ... the
     second cartridge is complete.

[337979]
_page : 454
_tape : 63/16
CC:  Okay. That's complete. The next step is to
     switch to the primary CO<sub>2</sub> canister and remove
     the secondary canister and stow it. Over.

[337994]
_page : 454
_tape : 63/16
LMP: Okay. I'm going to have to get off COMM here;
     I'll let Jack get the headset.

[337999]
_page : 454
_tape : 63/16
CC:  Okay.

[338008]
_page : 454
_tape : 63/16
CMP: Hey, Joe. I'm on the headset now.

[338046]
_page : 454
_tape : 63/16
LMP: Is that secondary? ... secondary?

[338064]
_page : 454
_tape : 63/16
LMP: Both cartridges are out.

[338073]
_page : 454
_tape : 63/16
CMP: Okay, Joe. Fred has the secondary cartridge out.
     We're back on primary now.

[338079]
_page : 454
_tape : 63/16
CC:  Okay, Jack. The next step is to place the command 
     module canisters with the hoses attached in
     a suitable location to permit the bottom of the
     canister to be exposed to free airflow and tape
     them in place. Ideally, well, it doesn't matter.
     Just - just pick out your own spot.
     END OF TAPE
[338105]
_page : 455
_tape : 64/1
CMP: Okay. I'm going to tell you where they are.
     They're both situated, as you say, with the
     bottom of the canister exposed to free air, and
     one is sitting right by the - the LMP's is sitting 
     right by the EPS panel, and the CDR's is
     up in the tunnel.

[338126]
_page : 455
_tape : 64/1
CC:  Jack, Houston. The COMM got real noisy there,
     and I didn't copy that. Stand by a moment.

[338162]
_page : 455
_tape : 64/1
CMP: Okay, Joe. How do you read now?

[338164]
_page : 455
_tape : 64/1

[338169]
_page : 455
_tape : 64/1
CMP: Okay. The canisters are situated as you - as
     you would like with the bottom of the canister
     exposed to free air.

[338177]
_page : 455
_tape : 64/1
CC:  Okay.

[338178]
_page : 455
_tape : 64/1
CMP: The position of the LMP's canister - The LMP's
     canister is sitting on the EPS panel now, and
     the CDR's canister is positioned up in the tunnel.

[338191]
_page : 455
_tape : 64/1
CC:  Okay. Real fine, Jack. The next step is to
     physically separate both blue hoses a good distance 
     away from the canister so that we don't
     short circuit the flow, and tape them in place;
     and the ideal location for them would be up in
     the tunnel so as to get some flow into the command 
     module. Over.

[338217]
_page : 455
_tape : 64/1
CMP: Both hoses in the - up into the command module?

[338223]
_page : 455
_tape : 64/1
CC:  Oh, you can use your judgment on that, Jack.
     We'd like at least one, arid the recommendation
     that I got was to put them both up in the tunnel.

[338235]
_page : 455
_tape : 64/1
CMP: Okay. We have the LMP's blue hose up by the
     LMP's window and the - Of course, the red hose
     is separated by some 4 feet. And the - Okay.
     We're going to - and the other hose - the - has
     the extension on it - The CDR's blue hose, of
     course, has the extension on it, and it's blowing way up in the command module. And the red
     hose is about - Oh, it's right at the docking
     ring where the blue latches are, so there's about
     4 or 5 feet difference from there, too. Is this
     satisfactory?

[338283]
_page : 456
_tape : 64/2
CC:  Okay, Jack. That sounds satisfactory. The next
     steps are - are suit-loop configuration steps,
     and the first one is to - -

_tape : 64/2
CMP: Okay. I got that done.

[338403]
_page : 456
_tape : 64/2
CC:  Okay. And the last step is select secondary
     CO<sub>2</sub> canister. We'll let it flow through the
     empty hole, and let's see how we do.

[338413]
_page : 456
_tape : 64/2
CMP: Select secondary CO<sub>2</sub> canister.

[338416]
_page : 456
_tape : 64/2
CC:  Roger, Jack. That completes that procedure, and
     the next thing I've got for you is a procedure
     for going back into the command module and powering 
     up the main buses temporarily using the BUS
     TIE switches. We want to do this for two reasons:
     first of all, we want it absolutely verified that
     there are no loads on the main buses, that we've
     got everything off that the buses look good;
     and the second thing we want to do is to power
     the bus - the main buses, with the BUS TIE motor
     switches, and then depower them by pulling the
     circuit breakers, leaving the MAIN BUS TIE switches
     in the on position, just to assure that they'll
     be there when we need them, whether the batteries
     get cold or not. Over.

[338493]
_page : 457
_tape : 64/3
CMP: Okay, Joe. How you read?

[338496]
_page : 457
_tape : 64/3
CC:  Better now, Jack. Satisfactory. Did you copy
     my rationale for the main bus powerup?

[338505]
_page : 457
_tape : 64/3
CMP: Yes, I did. You want to remove - You want to
     power up both buses, with the BUS TIE motor
     switches; first of all, to see that there are
     no loads on tho buses, and second, and then
     depower the buses by pulling the circuit breakers
     to insure that the motor switches don't - that
     the BUS TIES stay on so that they're there when
     we need them.

[338529]
_page : 457
_tape : 64/3
CC:  That's correct, Jack. Are you ready to copy the
     procedure?

[338535]
_page : 457
_tape : 64/3
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[338536]
_page : 457
_tape : 64/3
CC:  Okay. As the first step, I have one change to
     the basic configuration that we gave you, and
     it's two more circuit breakers that we want open.
     On panel 225 - Are you ready to write that down?
     Over.

[338555]
_page : 457
_tape : 64/3
CMP: Yes. I'm all ready, Joe. Go ahead.

[338568]

_tape : 64/3
CMP: Joe, I'm all ready. Go ahead.

[338570]
_page : 457
_tape : 64/3
CC:  Okay. On panel 225, we want the RENDEZVOUS
     TRANSPONDER FLIGHT BUS circuit breaker open, and
     the S-BAND FM TRANSMITTER/DSE FLIGHT BUS circuit
     breaker open. Over.

[338604]
_page : 457
_tape : 64/3
CMP: Okay. TV RENDEZVOUS TRANSPONDER FLIGHT BUS,
     open; TV S-BAND TRANSMITTER/DSE FLIGHT BUS open
     on panel 225.

[338615]
_page : 458
_tape : 64/4
CC:  Okay. That's correct, Jack. And now we'll go
     into the main bus powerup procedure. And the
     first step there, is on panel 5. We want the
     BAT CHARGER BAT A CHARGE circuit breaker closed,
     and the BAT CHARGER BAT B CHARGE circuit breaker
     closed. Over.

[338655]
_page : 458
_tape : 64/4
CMP: Okay. That's BAT CHARGER BAT A CHARGE, BAT
     CHARGER BAT B CHARGE, both closed on panel 5.

[338665]
_page : 458
_tape : 64/4
CC:  That's affirmative. We need them closed to power
     the switches. Next on panel 5, we want the EPS
     SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN A and MAIN B circuit breakers
     closed. Over.

[338692]
_page : 458
_tape : 64/4
CMP: Okay. Panel 5, CB EPS sensor's signals MAIN A
     and MAIN B closed.

[338700]
_page : 458
_tape : 64/4
CC:  Okay. That's affirmative. We need them closed
     so that you can read out your volts and amps.
     Next step, on panel 250, we want circuit breaker
     BAT A POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING and BAT B POWER
     ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed. Over.

[338735]
_page : 458
_tape : 64/4
CMP: Okay on panel 250, CB BAT A POWER, ENTRY and
     POSTLANDING, closed; BAT B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.

[338750]
_page : 458
_tape : 64/4
CC:  That's affirmative. And at that point, we'd like
     you to check the BAT bus voltages on both BAT
     buses to make sure we don't have any shorts.
     Over.

[338769]
_page : 458
_tape : 64/4
CMP: Okay. Read the BAT bus voltages on BAT BUS A
     and BAT BUS B.

[338773]
_page : 458
_tape : 64/4
CC:  That's affirmative. The next step on panel 275:
     circuit breaker MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed, and
     circuit breaker MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed. Over.

[338804]
_page : 458
_tape : 64/4
CMP: Okay. On 275, circuit breakers MAIN A, BAT BUS A,
     closed; MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed.

[338816]
_page : 458
_tape : 64/4
CC:  That's affirmative. The next step on panel 5:
     we want the MAIN BUS TIE A/C switch to the BAT
     A/C position, and verify proper voltage on MAIN
     BUS A, and read the amps on BAT A to make sure
     we don't have a short. Over.

[338849]
_page : 458
_tape : 64/4
CMP: Okay. ...

[338866]
_page : 459
_tape : 64/5
CC:  Okay, Jack; Houston. We're in had COMM again;
     let's wait a minute.

[338883]
_page : 459
_tape : 64/5
CMP: Okay. How do you read ...?

[338884]
_page : 459
_tape : 64/5
CC:  That's better, Jack. Go ahead with your readback.

[338890]
_page : 459
_tape : 64/5
CMP: Okay. Place MAIN BUS TIE A/C, on, read MAIN
     BUS A current and voltage.

[338899]
_page : 459
_tape : 64/5
CC:  Okay. That's affirmative. The next step will
     be the MAIN BUS TIE B/C switch to the on position
     and read MAIN B voltage and battery B amperage
     as above. Over.

[338929]
_page : 459
_tape : 64/5
CMP: Okay, MAIN BUS TIE B/C on; read MAIN B voltage
     and current.

[338935]
_page : 459
_tape : 64/5
CC:  Okay. That is correct. Then to reconfigure
     from this configuration, Jack, we want you to
     leave the MAIN BUS TIE switches in the on position 
     and pull the circuit breakers out in reverse
     order that we had you close them. Over; and do
     you want me to read them up individually?

[338957]
_page : 459
_tape : 64/5
CMP: No, let me see if I've got it here. I go down
     to panel 275, open CB MAIN A, BAT BUS A and CB
     MAIN B, BAT BUS B. Then I go down to 250, and
     pull CB BAT A POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING and BAT B
     POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING and then up on panel 5,
     pull EPS SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN A, SENSOR SIGNAL
     MAIN B, BATTERY CHARGER BAT B CHARGE, BATTERY
     CHARGER BAT A CHARGE. And then close - I don't
     know whether you want me to close the RENDEZVOUS
     RADAR TRANSPONDER FLIGHT BUS and S-BAND
     TRANSMITTER/DSE FLIGHT BUS.

[339003]
_page : 459
_tape : 64/5
CC:  Okay, Jack. We don't want you to close those
     last two. Those are changes to your basic configuration, 
     and we want to leave them open for 
     now. Over.

[339015]
_page : 459
_tape : 64/5
CMP: Okay. I'll do that. Was the rest of the readback okay?

[339017]
_page : 459
_tape : 64/5
CC:  That's correct. Readback was 100 percent, and
     we'll wait to hear from you.
[339032]
_page : 460
_tape : 64/6
CMP: Okay, Joe. And just for confirmation, I went
     through the switch list you gave me. We are in
     exactly that configuration with one exception,
     and that is over on panel 382. I have not, the
     a - H<sub>2</sub>O ACCUMULATOR is in the OFF position so
     that if we need any more water, we can get it.

[339065]
_page : 460
_tape : 64/6
CC:  Okay. Roger, Jack. Copy that. On panel 382,
     you've left the H<sub>2</sub>O ACCUMULATOR valves in the
     OFF position, and we concur.

[339076]
_page : 460
_tape : 64/6
CMP: Okay. And there's one other thing that I don't
     know whether you're aware of. We have no lithium
     hydroxide canisters in panel two fif- in - canisters 
     now. So when we get ready to power up,
     you'll have to remind us when you want us to add
     some.

[339098]
_page : 460
_tape : 64/6
CC:  Okay, Jack. We copy that. That's correct, and
     I'll add that to our basic checklist so that we
     won't forget it.

[339107]
_page : 460
_tape : 64/6
CMP: Okay. Real fine, Joe, and I'm on my way back
     into the command module.

     MASTER ALARM circuit breaker in so you'll have
     audio and visual on that, and, also, we medical
     types are getting to feel left out down here, and
     we'd like you to give us BIOMED ... position, if
     you're plugged in for it, and we'll see whether
     it affects the voice or not. Over.

_tape : 64/7
LMP: Okay, Jack just ... himself back down. And after
     he put on the 250 BAT A, BAT B breakers, he read
     BAT bus volts as 32.3 on A, 37.0 on B; he then
     punched in the 275 breakers, which tied the
     batteries to the buses, and at that time he read
     the A bus volts 32.0 on A, zero amps; 37.0 on B,
     zero amps.

[339599]
_page : 461
_tape : 64/7
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. The COMM got noisy there,
     and I want to make sure we get these numbers
     right, so I'd like to ask you to repeat them ...

[339660]
_page : 461
_tape : 64/7
LMP: Okay. How do you read now, Joe?

[339661]
_page : 461
_tape : 64/7
CC:  Okay; probably okay, Fred. Read it nice and
     slow so we'll be sure to get it. Over.

[339670]
_page : 461
_tape : 64/7
LMP: Okay. Jack pushed in the 250 BAT A, BAT B entry
     breakers. He read battery bus volts as 32.3 on
     A, 37.0 on B. Then he pushed in the 275 breakers
     tying the BATs to the main buses. In this configuration, 
     MAIN A is at 32.0 volts, zero amps;
     MAIN B is at 37.0 volts, zero amps. So it looks
     like the buses are okay.

[339707]
_page : 461
_tape : 64/7
CC:  Okay, Fred. Copy those numbers and thank you
     very much. I assume you got them off all right.

[339720]
_page : 461

     working down there.

[340401]
_page : 462
_tape : 64/8

     we're all delighted. It seems to be working
     fine.

[340411]
_page : 462
_tape : 64/8
LMP: Boy, that is great.

[340420]
_page : 462
_tape : 64/8
CC:  And Fred, Houston. In a little while here, I'm
     going to have a procedure that I want to read up
     to you and have you copy down for future use.
     It's a procedure for powering the command module
     main bus off the LM, and it's something that we
     feel that's going to come in real handy later on
     for such things as popping off the command module
     entry batteries, and also possibly for doing some
     preheating and preliminary powering up of the
     command module before we get rid of the LM. We'll
     have that for you in probably 10 or 15 minutes.
     Over.

[340465]
_page : 462
_tape : 64/8
LMP: Okay, okay, Joe. That's good. Sounds good.

_page : 462
_tape : 64/8
LMP: Go ahead.

[340578]
_page : 462
_tape : 64/8
CC:  Okay, Fred. Our procedure-generating mill has
     generated another very short one for you here.
     It's a procedure for getting an onboard read-out - -

[340587]
_page : 462
_tape : 64/8
LMP: Stand by 1, Joe.

[340598]
_page : 462
_tape : 64/8
CC:  Okay.

[340622]
_page : 463
_tape : 64/9
LMP: Okay, Joe. Go ahead.

[340625]
_page : 463
_tape : 64/9
CC: Okay, Fred. This is a procedure for getting a
     read-out of the descent propellant tank temps.
     It's no big problem, but our LM people say that
     the bottom of the descent stage is probably cooling 
     off, and we just want to verify that the
     descent water tank will be okay. Right now, it
     looks as though it won't freeze until several
     hours after it's empty, but we want to have you
     read these temperatures out to us so we can see
     how good our predictions are. The procedure is,
     on panel 16, close the PROPELLANT DISPLAYtENGINE
     OVERRIDE LOGIC circuit breaker. Over.

[340692]
_page : 463
_tape : 64/9
LMP: Okay. The PROPELLANT DISPLAY OVERRIDE circuit
     breakers are closed. ... the propellant.

[340701]
_page : 463
_tape : 64/9
CC:  Right, Fred. The next step is simply to turn
     the PROPELLANT TEMP PRESS MONITOR switch to
     DESCENT 1, read the fuel and OX temps, turn it
     to DESCENT 2, read the fuel and OX temps; tell
     us what they are.

[340724]
_page : 463
_tape : 64/9
LMP: Okay. On DESCENT 1, I get a fuel temp of
     66.5 degrees, OX ... on DESCENT 2, I get ...

[340745]
_page : 463
_tape : 64/9
CC:  Okay, Fred. We're in noisy COMM here; I got
     DESCENT 1 fuel 66.5; stand by a second.

[340775]
_page : 463
_tape : 64/9
LMP: Okay. How do you read, now ...?

[340777]
_page : 463
_tape : 64/9
CC:  That's better. Go ahead.

[340787]
_page : 463
_tape : 64/9
LMP: Okay. You got 66.5 on DESCENT 1 fuel temp,
     oxidizer temp is 66 degrees.

[340793]
_page : 463
_tape : 64/9
CC:  Okay. Copy - -

[340794]
_page : 463
_tape : 64/9
LMP: On DESCENT TANK 2, fuel is reading 60 - Okay.
     DESCENT 2 fuel is reading 68 degrees; oxidizer,
     65 degrees.

[340803]
_page : 463
_tape : 64/9
CC:  Okay. Copy that, Fred. Thank you. We'd like
     you to pull the circuit breaker, and we'll probably 
     come to you again in 5 or 6 hours for another
     check.

[340814]
_page : 463

_tape : 64/10
CC:  Okay. We're chasing a small glitch that we saw
     a while ago in the O<sub>2</sub> flow rate which is now
     normal again, but what we'd like you to do is,
     first of all, to tell us whether, during that
     canister procedure, you moved O<sub>2</sub> DEMAND REG A
     to any position other than CABIN, and then we'd
     like you to move it to OFF momentarily and back
     to CABIN for us.

[341259]
_page : 464
_tape : 64/10
LMP: Okay. To answer your question, Joe, it's no.
     I checked the CABIN all the time. Qualitatively,
     when we switched to this configuration, it didn't
     seem like the frequency or the suit fan noise ...
     decreased ... logged down a little bit, but I'll
     follow your procedure. You want me to take REG A,
     go to close and back to CABIN; is that correct?

[341710]
_page : 465
_tape : 64/11
CC:  Oh. Our little plot shows you just touching the
     180-thousand-mile line. So you're about 40 K
     out from the Moon.

[341720]
_page : 465
_tape : 64/11
LMP: Okay. Okay. And the other thing is, we've
     noticed some fresh new particles floating around
     outside, so possibly the service module is starting 
     to vent a little bit again.

[341739]
_page : 465
_tape : 64/11
CC:  Okay. Copy that, Fred. On the O<sub>2</sub> flow thing,
     we clearly saw the DEMAND REGULATOR go to OFF
     and back to CABIN. TEL, MU [?] thinks that it's
     no big thing that you've seen a little change
     in flow due to the different resistance we've
     got in the circuit.

     to you. Before I do, I want to mention something
     that will be of interest to Fred. We are looking
     at the SHe tank pressure rise and we expect it to
     blow. We don't know exactly what time it will go,
     somewhere around 105 hours or perhaps later than
     that. We've got plenty of blowdown capability.
     We just thought you ought to be informed.

     now, Jack?

[342775]

     or a short one, or a medium sized ... about how
     many pages?

[342781]
_page : 469
_tape : 64/15
CC:  It's about - I'd say 15 to 20 steps, Jack. Some
     of it is LM stuff, and the rest of it is in CSM.

[342795]
_page : 469
_tape : 64/15

     copy.

[342798]
_page : 469
_tape : 64/15
CC:  Okay. I'll give you the LM steps first. They
     have to be done first, and the first step is on
     panels 11 and 16, circuit breakers ASCENT CA,
     ASC ECA, two to close.

[342822]
_page : 469
_tape : 64/15
CMP: Okay. Panels 11 and 16 CBs ASCENT ECA to closed.

[342830]
_page : 469

     ECA CONTROL, two, to close. Over.

[342851]
_page : 469
_tape : 64/15
CMP: Okay. On 11 and 16 CBs ASCENT ECA CONTROLs to
     close.

[342859]
_page : 469
_tape : 64/15
CC:  Okay. That's correct. The next step is BAT 5
     and 6 NORMAL FEED to high; those are switches.

[342881]
_page : 469
_tape : 64/15
CMP: Okay. BATs 5 and 6 NORMAL FEED, ON.

[342886]
_page : 469
_tape : 64/15

     slash RESET. Over.

[342905]
_page : 469

CMP: BATs 1 and 3 to OFF slash RESET.

[342909]
_page : 469

     preconditioning.

[342923]

[342929]
_page : 469
_tape : 64/15

     BATs 2 and 4 to OFF/RESET.

[342950]
_page : 469

CMP: Okay. BATs 2 and 4 to OFF/RESET.

[342955]
_page : 469
_tape : 64/15

     the first step there is connect LM/CSM umbilical.
     Over.

_tape : 64/16
CMP: Okay. Connect LM/CSM umbilical.

[342977]
_page : 470
_tape : 64/16

     MAIN B and LM POWER-2 MAIN B, both, closed. Over.

[343003]
_page : 470
_tape : 64/16

     MAIN B, both, closed.

[343012]
_page : 470
_tape : 64/16

     POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING; closed. Over.

[343060]
_page : 470
_tape : 64/16
CMP: Okay. On panel 250: CB BAT B POWER ENTRY/
     POSTLANDING, closed.

[343070]
_page : 470
_tape : 64/16

     LM POWER switch on panel 2 to CSM. Over.

[343094]
_page : 470
_tape : 64/16
CMP: Okay. That's verify the MAIN BUS voltage, and
     switch LM POWER to CSM.

[343103]
_page : 470
_tape : 64/16
CC:  Okay. That's correct. Then go back to 275, CB
     MAIN B BAT BUS B to open. Hey, Jack, that's the
     step I skipped for you, I'm afraid. Before
     verifying MAIN BUS voltage, you have to, on panel
     275, close CB MAIN B BAT BUS B. Over.

[343147]
_page : 470

[343155]
_page : 470
_tape : 64/16

     POSTLANDING on, then I want to push the - on
     panel 275 MAIN B to BAT BUS B in, huh?

[343178]
_page : 470
_tape : 64/16
CC:  That's right. Then you go to verify MAIN BUS
     voltage, LM POWER to CSM, and then, on panel 275,
     circuit breaker MAIN B BAT BUS B to open. Over.

[343193]
_page : 470
_tape : 64/16
CMP: Okay. After verifying the MAIN BUS voltage connecting 
     the LM POWER to CSM I want to pull MAIN
     B BAT BUS B, or MAIN B to BAT BUS B, open.

[343206]
_page : 470
_tape : 64/16
CC: That's correct. And then on panel 250, circuit
     breaker BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING to open,
     and verify MAIN BUS B voltage.
[343237]
_page : 471
_tape : 64/17
CMP: Okay. Panel 250 BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, 
     open, and then verify the MAIN BUS voltage.

[343244]
_page : 471
_tape : 64/17
CC: Okay. That's correct. The last steps are to
     get the LM back on descent batteries. The first 
     step is BATs 1, 2, 3, and 4, HI VOLTAGE, ON.
     Over.

[343272]
_page : 471
_tape : 64/17
CMP: Okay. Then the next step is a LM step, BATs 1, 
     2, 3, and 4, HI VOLTAGE, ON.

[343279]
_page : 471
_tape : 64/17
CC: That's correct; and the last step in the LM,
     BATs 5 and 6 to OFF. Over.

[343293]
_page : 471
_tape : 64/17
CMP: Say again; you cut out there, Joe.

[343296]
_page : 471
_tape : 64/17
CC: Okay, Jack. The last step in the LM, BATTERIES
     5 and 6 to OFF. Over.

[343307]
_page : 471
_tape : 64/17
CMP: Okay. BATs 5 and 6 go OFF.

[343311]
_page : 471
_tape : 64/17
CC:  That's correct. That should configure you. Note
     that circuit-breaker protection on that circuit
     limits the available current to 15 amps. We think
     we can do quite a bit with it though. And the
     LM/CSM umbilical will be hot and MAIN BUS voltage
     may be monitored by selecting MAIN B on the gage.
     Over.

[343336]
_page : 471
_tape : 64/17
CMP: Okay. Real fine.

[343380]
_page : 471
_tape : 64/17
LMP: Okay. While Jack was on COMM, I was looking out
     the docking window here, and I could see another
     good shower of particles coming out of the service
     module. And the position this time appears to be
     on the other side. Before, we'd always seen them
     out of window 1, and where I'm looking at it from
     here, it looks like it'd be down below window 6
     somewhere in the service module. Jack's going
     upstairs to see what it looks like up there.
[343413]
_page : 472

     show you how relaxed we are about the entry, Ken

LMP: Brings up another possibility. Now that we've
     got all of that stowed into the bags and the
     condensate can, we could probably blow all of
     that through the PLSS ..., I wonder how the
     sublimator would work on waste water.
     END OF TAPE

[343658]
_page : 474
_tape : 65/1
CC: It might work if we had to do it, Fred. Right
     now we're looking at a comfortable excess of
     water through the sublimator. We were talking
     among ourselves this morning about having you
     try out the PLSS to ascent tank water-transfer
     situation and we decided not to do it, not to
     recommend it, because we figure it'd take us
     30 hours to empty one of the ascent tanks, which
     you have to do in order to get PLSS water to it,
     and we'd rather use the descent water and we don't
     think we've gotten any sweat. Over.

[343701]
_page : 474
_tape : 65/1
LMP: Okay, Joe. I don't think there's any question

     Earth now is really up to the top of the window.
     I have to get way down almost to the floorboards

[344479]
_page : 475
_tape : 65/2
CC:  Okay. Copied that, Fred. And our thermal people
     will be looking at it. One of the things we're
     talking about relative to the midcourse correction 
     is we'd like not to do it before the SHe tank
     goes, if it's going to go, just so it won't give
     us a problem reestablishing PTC. And right now
     our people think that the burst disk will pop
     around 106 hours.

CC:  Okay, Fred. Since you went ahead and used the
     PLSS condensate container, we got the procedure
     in for using it. I'm not going to read it up to
     you except that it cautions a little bit about
     shaking it too much or about filling it too full,
     because they feel that if you do that the vent
     valve might unseat and the bag might leak a little
     bit. Over.

[344830]
_page : 475
_tape : 65/2
LMP: Okay. We haven't removed it from its stowage
     spot. We just left it right in place, and just -
     he mated the tank at the end of the cable and
     hooked right into that.

[344845]
_page : 475
_tape : 65/2

     that you leave it in the stowage spot. That
     should help the situation.

[383644]

[383663]

_tape : Tape 72/1
CMP: Okay.

[383664]
_page : 537
_tape : Tape 72/1
CC: I've got some other information. We shouldn't
     have some good dope on your trajectory for about
     2 hours. Looked like to us that the burn was
     real good, however, and we're taking a close
     look at it, and we'll get back with you on that
     in about 2 hours from now. Another thing that
     we're expecting to have happen is that the
     SHe tank is going to reach its burst limit. The
     earliest time we predict this will happen will
     be at 107 hours on about 25 minutes. And the
     latest probable time is at 110 hours, and this
     is supposed to be a nonpropulsive vent, but you
     might hear it and you might see something.

[383706]
_page : 537
_tape : Tape 72/1
CMP: Okay. That's good news. We were wondering about
     that. And I'll relay all the other information
     you gave me.

[383714]
_page : 537
_tape : Tape 72/1
CC:  Okay. And if the SHe tank does burst during this
     time frame before we get trajectory info, why,
     that will delay our trajectory info somewhat.
     Your consumables, your rater is now good through

[383754]
_page : 538
_tape : Tape 72/2
CC:  Okay. We're predicting that you still have
     more water than you need. And one thing we'd
     like for you to do is when you're going to
     sleep up there in the command module take
     a look through the optics and see if you can
     see any stars.

[383777]
_page : 538
_tape : Tape 72/2
CMP: Okay, Jack, I will do. Jim and I were able to
     spot constellations from the windows of the LM
     when there's no venting taking place. Could
     you give me some time on these consumables, what
     you're predicting they're good for? I think
     you started to give them times, didn't you, or
     was I just hearing things.

[383816]
_page : 538
_tape : Tape 72/2
CC:  We started to give you some times. We think we
     might be able to give you some better ones pretty
     soon. But it looks like your water is good
     through 154 hours, and you've got takusan O<sub>2</sub>
     through 272 hours, plenty of lithium hydroxide,
     and your amp-hours ought to be good through 199
     or 200 hours. Over.

_tape : Tape 72/2
CC:  We expect that your water rate is going to drop
     off and at the time, DELTA will go up to 160 -

     interested in is what's your status on rest and
     medication.

[383883]
_page : 538
_tape : Tape 72/2
CMP: Okay. None of us, I know of, had any medications,
     and right now as far as rest, I suppose we're no

[383900]
_page : 538

     out of the telescope.

[384320]

_tape : Tape 72/3
CC:  Okay, Jack. We've got 14 cartridges that'll last
     157 hours, plus we've got the LM primary cartridge
     with 23 hours, and we've got two PLSS cartridges
     with 7 hours apiece.

[384335]

     hours out of the two canisters that we have
     there - 6 hours at least. However, at 112 hours,
     when we've got several people up, we're going to
     rig up two more and we have the new simplified
     procedure for doing this. However, in the
     meantime, should we need to have a canister
     change, we plan to switch to the LM primary
     canister. Over.

     on this last complete revolution, the Sun first
     appeared in the very top right corner of the LMP
     window, passed over the CDR window, and was

     better idea of how PTC is going. So, what
     we'd like for you to do is what we did last time.
     That is to give us a reading on the center of

[390249]
_page : 543
_tape : Tape 73/1

     midcourse.

[390278]
_page : 543
_tape : Tape 73/1
CDR: Okay. Understand, the no-COMM pad is no longer
     valid because of the midcourse. Entry angle
     based on the last 2 hours' tracking is 5.99,

     like we're going to wait on the tracking. For
     the time being, since you're in the corridor,
     why, there's no need to pass it up. But we're

_page : 544
_tape : Tape 73/2

     Underneath quad 4, I noticed a lot of sparklies
     going out.

[392161]
_page : 545
_tape : Tape 73/3

     say it yawed some?

[392168]
_page : 545
_tape : Tape 73/3
CDR: Yes, I was in a right yaw and now I'm in a left,
     yaw; at a much faster rate than the one we put
     in PTC.

[392188]
_page : 545

     And we understood you to say - -

[392250]
_page : 545
_tape : Tape 73/3
CDR: Okay.

[392251]
_page : 545

[392257]
_page : 545
_tape : Tape 73/3
CDR: Sure did, Jack. It reversed my yaw completely
     and put in a little pitch, I think.

[392273]
_page : 545
_tape : Tape 73/3
CDR: But more than anything, it reversed my yaw.

[392276]
_page : 545
_tape : Tape 73/3
CC:  Roger. Have you effectively established PTC
     in the opposite direction then?

[392284]
_page : 545
_tape : Tape 73/3
CDR: Well, you could say that. I'm not too sure
     just what kind of pitch or roll I've got,
     coupled with the yaw. I just saw the Earth go
     by the LMP's window here, not too long ago at
     a rather faster rate than we had going the
     other direction.

[392318]
_page : 545

     shift OMNIs.

[392322]

[392332]

[392336]
_page : 545

[392344]
_page : 546
_tape : Tape 73/4

     seeing fewer sparklies?

[392352]
_page : 546
_tape : Tape 73/4
CDR: Yes. Much fewer. Not any at all, now. I'm
     not sure whether that vent gave me reverse yaw
     and roll - left roll - that's - if that's what
     it gave me.

[392374]
_page : 546
_tape : Tape 73/4

     left roll as opposed to opposite yaw.

[392385]
_page : 546
_tape : Tape 73/4

     too sure ...

[392390]
_page : 546
_tape : Tape 73/4
CC:  Okay. We'd kind of like to watch it, see what
     happens for a little while before we make a
     recommendation. However, we'll need some inputs
     from you on that.

[392402]
_page : 546
_tape : Tape 73/4
CDR: Well, we're in no trouble up here as far as -
     as far as the yaw goes. Everything's fine.
     It's faster than we had set up before. We just
     wanted to get into proper thermal constraint,
     and it's going to take me 15 minutes to get the
     thrusters up anyway.

[392458]
_page : 546
_tape : Tape 73/4
CC:  Okay, Skipper. We don't see any thermal problems
     as a result of this change. If we see some
     communications problems, we may have to do
     something different, but so far, so good. And
     we'd kind of like to hear from you on LPD numbers, if you get anything going by the window.

[392488]

[392529]
_page : 546
_tape : Tape 73/4

     to right. Is that right?

[392537]

[392552]
_page : 546
_tape : Tape 73/4

     concerned about is what change in your velocity
     this might have had and what DELTA-V it imparted,
     and we'll have to look at that for a while before
     we are able to determine it. And, if there is
     no significant change, why, we prefer just to
     leave it the way it is.

CDR: Okay. It's not really much trouble. That's all
     we're doing about it. We'll try to keep up with
     it. And you're satisfied with this attitude so
     far. I guess you're going to watch the thermal
     and find out whether perhaps we're going to some
     other PTC attitude.

[393895]
_page : 550
_tape : Tape 74/1
CC:  Roger. Thermal appears to be no problem. We're
     looking at what DELTA-V might have been imparted
     due to this, and it looks like we're not going
     to change the PTC attitude.

[393914]
_page : 550
_tape : Tape 74/1

     raised that angle a little bit.

[393944]
_page : 550
_tape : Tape 74/1

[394253]
_page : 550
_tape : Tape 74/1

     battery glitch was just that thermal switch
     triggered a mal - a CAUTION and WARNING, just
     cycled once, and triggered a MASTER ALARM again.
     We'll watch the batteries for you, since you
     don't have any CAUTION and WARNING on now.

[394273]

_tape : Tape 74/2

[395013]
_page : 551
_tape : Tape 74/2
CC:  Okay, Jim. Your luck is holding. Tracking shows
     that your entry angle has gone up to minus 6.24.
     This is on the basis of all the data we've collected between the midcourse up to the time the
     SHe tank went. So we'll continue to look at it,
     and see if SHe tank did anything to it at all.
     So it's - The data has gone from 5.9 to a
     minus 6.24.

     of humorous; Fred's sleeping place now is in the

     plans or thoughts being contemplated for the
     PLSSs or the OPS, whe;her we're going to use
     their LiOH canisters or take the devices back in
     the command module with us, or just what will be
     your plans.

[397399]
_page : 552
_tape : Tape 74/3
CC:  Jim, we've had a lot of people working on the
     entry procedures, and they'll be continuing to
     do so. We got a few ideas we'd like to toss at
     you so you can start thinking about them if you
     think you're in a position to discuss them without waking up the other guys. What do you think?

[397416]
_page : 552
_tape : Tape 74/3
CDR: Yes, go ahead. It's okay.

[397420]
_page : 552
_tape : Tape 74/3
CC: Okay. One of the first things we want to do is
     charge the battery in CSM, so we can get some
     LM power over there to do that, and we have procedures ginned up to do it. In regards to
     reentry, we're planning our last midcourse at
     5 hours before entry interface, and, if we have
     to make one, that is. And then we'd like to
     jettison the service module at 4 hours and a
     half, roughly, before entry interface, and take
     the next 3 to 3-1/2 hours for taking pictures,
     cranking up the command module G&N, taking care
     of stowage, and other odds and ends. And we'd
     hang on to the LM until 1 hour before entry
     interface, and then we'd jettison that. And
     these procedures are going to be run integrated
     in the CMS and LMS tomorrow morning, and, hopefully, later on in the day, we'll do it again
     with Mission Control on the loop. A couple of
     other things we'd like to toss at you: one
     question is what do we do with the OPS. The
     thought is that there is adequate O<sub>2</sub> in the
     command module and that the OPS represents high
     pressure source and a stowage problem, and people
     are thinking about leaving them in the LM. The
     other thing is that we think you might want to
     make this a suited entry, suiting up prior to
     LM jettison, because what we're doing is, when
     we jettison the LM, we're going to do it like
     we did in Apollo 10 - just let the beauty go,
     and if we weren't suited, why, we'd be betting
     on the hatch seal to take care of us. So we
     thought we'd toss these few ideas at you. Some
     of them are ones that are particularly pertinent
     questions at this time.

[397546]
_page : 553
_tape : Tape 74/4
CDR: Okay. A suited entry would sort of ... the
     1-hour LM jettison back and ... back and forth
     up to that time .... impede our progress back
     and forth ....

[397570]
_page : 553
_tape : Tape 74/4
CC:  We're losing you, Jim

[397573]
_page : 553
_tape : Tape 74/4
CDR: Okay. I think I've got you back. I guess the
     midcourse at 5 hours prior to ...

[397585]
_page : 553
_tape : Tape 74/4
CC: Affirmative, Jim. Midcourse 5 hours prior to
     entry interface.

[397595]
_page : 553
_tape : Tape 74/4
CDR: If that's the case, all I'm worried about is
     having that all squared away. It's long before
     that ... I want everything in its place. All
     the stowage cleared away, all the ... ready to
     go and know exactly what to do and ... so that
     we can do the midcourse, and ... get into the
     command module ... jettison the service module,
     and then know exactly how to get into the LM.

[397633]
_page : 553
_tape : Tape 74/4
CC:  Roger. Ail those procedures will work - will be
     worked out precisely, and we agree that the
     stowage and all of those peripheral details ought
     to be taken care of before midcourse.

[397651]
_page : 553
_tape : Tape 74/4
CDR: And, I guess, that last midcourse, we'd want to
     start looking at midcourse fairly early, if we
     have the power to do so, mainly because of attitude control. This last time was fairly easy,
     but I'm not too sure how long we can continue
     to ...

[397689]
_page : 553
_tape : Tape 74/4
CDR: I have ... in, and it seems about as cold as it
     is now, we'll probably be going into suits long
     before entry.

[397702]
_page : 553
_tape : Tape 74/4
_extra : 
CC:  Yes. That's what we were thinking.

[397730]
_page : 554
_tape : Tape 74/5
CC:  I guess the two things which are somewhat unresolved at the moment are what to do with the OPS
     and what to do about the suited entry. We
     thought we'd toss those at you to see what you
     thought about them.

[397746]
_page : 554
_tape : Tape 74/5
CDR: Okay. As far as the OPS is concerned, we have
     enough oxygen in the spacecraft ... to get us
     through. I have no ... command module ... suit
     loop prior to entry. I was looking at ... OPS
     ... sources of oxygen ... also in the - in the
     front of the suit loop or ... circulate ...

[397806]
_page : 554
_tape : Tape 74/5
CC:  Jim, I'm sorry. We're not catching what you're
     saying. The COMM is getting kind of bad right
     now.

[397815]
_page : 554
_tape : Tape 74/5
CDR: Okay, Jack. How do you read now?

[397818]
_page : 554
_tape : Tape 74/5
CC:  I've still got you with quite a bit of background
     noise, but if you talk up like that, I think we
     can hear you.

[397826]
_page : 554
_tape : Tape 74/5
CDR: Okay. My only concern about leaving the OPS
     and/or the PLSS in the command module is how
     soon do we have to live off the command module
     consumables prior to entry, and the PLSS has a
     fan and has a lithium hydroxide ... use the command module system. Also, the OPS ... right
     now ... command module ... command module oxygen
     and electrical power is ... but I had just as
     soon be ... back in the LM.

[397870]
_page : 554
_tape : Tape 74/5
CC:  It sounds like the general gist of your comments
     are that if things remain pretty much as they
     are now in the command module, you'd just as soon
     leave the OPS in the LM. Is that affirm?

[397884]
_page : 554
_tape : Tape 74/5
CDR: That's affirm.

[397891]
_page : 554
_tape : Tape 74/5

     suited entry bit a little while.

[397900]

     for entry, especially if you have the LM in
     back. Over.

[397941]
_page : 555
_tape : Tape 74/6
CC:  Roger. That's one subject that's been getting
     a lot of attention, and let me see if I can get
     some general ideas on that at the moment.

[397953]
_page : 555
_tape : Tape 74/6
CDR: Okay.

[398136]
_page : 555
_tape : Tape 74/6
CC: Jim, I can give you the general idea of the
     proposed procedure for bringing the command
     module G&N up. It's the presently proposed one.
     We may come up with a better one, but here's
     what we're looking at right now. First thing we
     plan to do is to - using the LM COAS, sight on
     the Earth with the LM just as we did in the midcourse. Then we'll do a body-axis aline, 400
     plus 5 on the ACS, to put the AGS ball at 000.
     And then we can give you an AGS ball attitude to
     fly to, to point the CSM optics at the Moon.
     And, if you can see stars, why, we can use those
     too. Then we can give you an equivalent set of
     CDU angles to put into NOUN 20 and to torque the
     platform over. So, now we're coarse alined.
     Then we do a fine aline by shooting at the Moon
     and then at the Sun. Do you follow all that?

[398225]
_page : 555
_tape : Tape 74/6
CDR: Okay, Jack. Let me see if I have it. What we
     do is point the LM at the Earth as we did for
     the midcourse COAS, and we do a body-axis aline
     on the AGS. Then you give us an AGS ball attitude to fly to .... the LM, and then we ...
     point the ... at the Moon. Then you would update
     the - give us some CDUs to coarse aline. ...
     fine aline ... on stars or the Moon or the Earth.
     Stand by. Okay. We had another MASTER ALARM,
     Jack. I don't see any lights down there, except
     the battery light's still there. You want - -
     ... display ECS. Okay. And the number 2 battery
     still has a light on it. I suspect it may be the
     same problem that we had before ......

[398310]
_page : 555
_tape : Tape 74/6
CC:  Okay. Let us talk it over a second, and we'll
     tell you what to do.

[398340]
_page : 555
_tape : Tape 74/6
CC:  Jim, is the battery light kind of flickering?

[398346]
_page : 555
_tape : Tape 74/6
_extra : 
CDR: Yes. That's affirm, Jack.

[398356]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CDR: Yes. The battery light's flickering, and it
     triggers off the MASTER ALARM.

[398361]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CC:  Okay. Well, that - temperature sensor on battery 2 is kind of cycling back and forth and
     every time it does, it triggers a MASTER ALARM,
     Jim.

[398377]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CDR: Okay. Same old problem, huh?

[398379]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CC:  Yes.

[398413]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CC:  And, Jim, finally on the P52, we're considering
     using the - the Moon and then the Sun for the fine aline.

[398424]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CDR: Okay. The Moon and the Sun for the fine aline.
     Understand. We'll go through this again here ...

[398455]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CDR: Okay, Jack. Once - Once I get the spacecraft at
     the proper attitude ...

[398482]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CC:  Jim, I didn't copy your last question due to
     background noise.

[398489]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CDR: Okay. Once - Once you get the AOS ball alined
     ... command module ...

[398509]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CC:  After we do the body axis aline on the AGS, we
     can tell you what attitude on the AGS ball to
     fly to in order to poiat the CSM optics at the
     Moon or at some star. And then we can, knowing
     where the optics are pointed, give you an equivalent set of CDU angles to put in NOUN 20 to
     torque the platform.

[398542]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CDR: Okay. I see.

[398550]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CC:  That's the current thinking. It may change
     between now and tomorrow, but right now, that's
     the way it looks, Jim. It'll probably be some
     take-off on that anyway.

[398563]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CDR: Okay. Are they planning on a G&N entry or using
     another system, like EMS or something like that?

[398574]

[398899]
_page : 557
_tape : Tape 74/8
CDR: I understand that one of your reasons for a
     suited entry is the fact that the command module
     hatch ... hasn't been good. It doesn't seem to
     be any different, but in the other ... our hatch
     is no better than other spacecraft.

[398938]
_page : 557
_tape : Tape 74/8
CC:  No, the situation, Jim, is that your hatch is
     as good as any other hatch but that we won't
     have a chance to verify it until so late in the
     game, like 1 hour before entry interface, in this
     case; whereas before, why, we had a chance to
     evaluate it in lunar orbit. Over.

_page : 557
_tape : Tape 74/8
CDR: Oh, okay.

[398967]
_page : 557
_tape : Tape 74/8
CC:  And that might make your time line a little too
     crowded, getting your suits on there at the last
     minute; say, less than an hour before entry
     interface.

[398984]
_page : 557
_tape : Tape 74/8

[399030]
_page : 557
_tape : Tape 74/8
_extra : 
CC: Jim, the next action item we want to pursue is
     transferring some LM power up to the command
     module MAIN B so we can start charging battery,
     and I guess what we ought to do is start on that
     one when somebody else gets up to help you there.
     So, when you decide to get the other guys up, or
     to have someone help, why, let us know and we'll
     start working on that.

[399063]

     think you wanted to know when the procedures [on]
     entry are going to be available and read up to
     you. If that's the case, why, we're talking
     about 120 hours or so. As far as the - charging
     battery A, we want to do that as soon as the
     other guys get up to help you. We've already
     passed up some of that procedure, and we have a
     couple of DELTAs to it.

CC: Okay, Jack. The CSM procedure's okay, and then
     we had to go back to the LM and do something.
     And the first line is okay, cross out "BAT 5
     and 6 OFF," delete that. And delete the next
     line also, that says "Panel 11 to 16 ASCENT ECA
     CONTROL, open." Then we had a couple of notes
     which remain the same. Go ahead.

[399560]
_page : 561
_tape : Tape 75/1
CMP: Okay. I didn't get the notes, but I'll read
     you the steps as I have them now. One step,
     BAT 1, 2, 3, and 4 ... and at this point should
     have BATTERIES 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 ON. Is that
     affirmative?

[399579]
_page : 561
_tape : Tape 75/1
CC: That's affirmative. So now we have BAT 1, 2,
     3, 4, and 6, ON, and I got two notes. Number 1
     is: your circuit breaker protection limits -
     your circuit breaker protection - limits the
     current to 15 amps. Number 2 note is: now the
     umbilical between the LM and the command module
     is hot. And the MAIN BUS voltage can be monitored by selecting MAIN B.

[399646]
_page : 561
_tape : Tape 75/1
CMP: Okay, Jack. These notes are: circuit breaker
     protection limits current to 15 amps. The tube,
     the umbilical between the CSM and LM is hot.
     I can monitor MAIN B for the bus voltage.

[399664]
_page : 561
_tape : Tape 75/1
CC:  That's affirm, Jack.

[399682]
_page : 561
_tape : Tape 75/1
CMP: Okay, Jack. One question here. If we transfer
     power like this, we're not going to cut us short
     on power remaining in the CSM ..., are we ...?

[399697]
_page : 561
_tape : Tape 75/1
CC:  Say it again, Jack. I didn't get it.

[399703]
_page : 561
_tape : Tape 75/1
CMP: Okay. Stand by. If we configure the CSM for
     powering up the LM, we aren't going to cut it
     short on LM power requirements to get us back
     in the entry interface, are we?

[399723]
_page : 561
_tape : Tape 75/1
CC:  That's a negative, Jack. According to the latest
     update, we've got ampere-hours out to 203 hours.

[399740]
_page : 561
_tape : Tape 75/1
CMP: Stand by. ...

[399760]
_page : 561
_tape : Tape 75/1
CMP: Okay, Jack. One question from Jim is, he wants
     to know whether the procedure has been tried ...

[399784]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2
CC: Okay. Try it again, now, Jack. What did Jim
     want to know?

[399790]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2
CMP: Okay. He would like to know whether the procedure has been tried and whether it has been
     found to be okay; and there's no danger of
     shorting out any of our batteries or anything
     we have on board the LM now.

[399860]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2
CC:  Okay, Jack. This procedure has not been tried
     out as such; however, the hardware paths
     through which the current flows are the same
     ones which we used during translunar trajectory,
     and there's not a problem with shorting out a
     descent battery. Over.

[399887]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2
CMP: Okay. I'll relay that to Jim.

[399909]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2
CC:  Jack, of course, the reason for all of this is
     that we see we're 20 amp-hours short on one of
     the entry batteries, and we've got to juice
     that up to get you home with.

[399925]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2
CMP: Okay.

[399930]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2
CC: Okay. What we owe you from here on out is the
     actual battery A charge procedure, and then a
     procedure to turn this all around, again.

[399948]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2
CMP: Okay. Do you have it there, and how long is
     it ...

[399975]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2
CC:  Okay, Jack. I have the procedure in front of
     me. It's about 18 steps, and the reason it's
     so long is because we're starting from this
     basic configuration which we gave you earlier.
     It concerns a charge on battery A, of course,
     which is our low one. So, when you're ready
     to copy it, let me know.

[400000]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2
CMP: Okay. Let's go at it.

[400006]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2

[400013]

_tape : Tape 75/2
CMP: Go ahead.

[400014]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2
_extra : 
CC: Okay. On panel 250, circuit breaker BAT A,
     POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, close; on panel 275,
     circuit breaker INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, close.
     Next several circuit breakers are on panel 5;
     whether we can use the attitude control -
     controller only to maneuver the combination to
     photograph the service module at 4 plus 30.

[433992]
_page : 599
_tape : Tape 81/5
CC:  Okay. Good thinking. We are - it's - There has
     been a lot of consideration of what kind of
     maneuvers to let you do to photograph the LM, I
     mean the service module. We consider it quite
     low priority; the feeling is that it will be real
     nice to get pictures of the service module, but
     they are not required for our troubleshooting
     program. As far as the - the attitude control
     authority, and so forth, we will get you more
     detailed word on that later; we are working it.
     It appears that using the ACA instead of the
     TTCA after service module JETT will give you
     excellent attitude control authority, and that's
     what we recommend.

[434043]
_page : 599
_tape : Tape 81/5
CDR: Okay. And I'm ... - use an AGS ATT HOLD configuration to keep the attitudes - turn the LM JETT
     attitudes.

[434054]
_page : 599
_tape : Tape 81/5
CC:  That's affirm. We are - We are probably going to
     recommend a tight deadband AGS attitude hold for
     that.

[434063]
_page : 599
_tape : Tape 81/5
CDR: Okay.

[434089]
_page : 599
_tape : Tape 81/5
CDR: Okay. The star check at the entry attitude, is
     it a sextant star check or a COAS star check?

[434100]
_page : 599
_tape : Tape 81/5
CC:  It'll probably be a sextant star check, Jim. It
     really depends on how good that platform is that
     we get. And we expect it to be plenty good enough
     for a sextant star check.

[434114]
_page : 599
_tape : Tape 81/5
CDR: Okay.

[434115]
_page : 599
_tape : Tape 81/5
_extra : 
CC:  While we are on that subject, Jim, I want to
     mention one thing to Jack. As I said, this CSM
     alinement procedure we are going to recommend is
     a Moon/Sun, and there are Sim filters stowed;
     they are stowed in compartment R-1; however,
     they are for the telescope only, of course, not
     the sextant. One is for the long eye-relief
     piece, the other for the normal eyepiece. And
     if he has any questions about that, we'll be
     glad to talk about it.

[434154]
_page : 600
_tape : Tape 81/6
CDR: Okay.

[434167]
_page : 600
_tape : Tape 81/6
CDR: And because it will be too late to do much about
     a hatch integrity check if it fails, you want us
     to have our suits on sometime during this period?

[434180]
_page : 600
_tape : Tape 81/6
CC:  Okay, Jim. We are laying for you on that one;
     it is a subject that we wanted to - to bring up
     with you. We have been considering it, and our
     feelings are - Of course, it is up to you, but
     as we see the pros and cons, you just put your
     finger on the pro. We do a hatch integrity
     check shortly before RI minus 1 hours, and if we
     bust it, you would have a hard time scrambling
     into the suits. On the other hand, the disadvantages of wearing the suits are that they might
     slow you down considerably, not even counting the
     time to don them, and someone is even very
     concerned that after such and such a period of
     time in the suits, you might get too warm, and we
     might have to power up the SUIT LOOP to ventilate
     the suits and we don't particularly want to do that
     because it cost quite a bit of power. Consequently, our recommendation was going to be that you
     not wear the suit, since we have no reason to
     believe that the integrity check will show us
     anything but a slightly increased leak rate, and
     we can certainly hack that. What do you think?
     Over.

[434258]
_page : 600
_tape : Tape 81/6
CDR: Well, I have confidence in the hatch, as long
     as it goes in and locks in smoothly; I see no
     reason why we need the suits, and one thing we
     are going to do during our spare time is to
     practice putting that hatch on, make sure we
     get it on and locked.

[434275]
_page : 600
_tape : Tape 81/6
CC:  Okay. Real good. And with that precaution,
     think we can concur on that decision.

[434291]
_page : 600
_tape : Tape 81/6
CDR: And that's all the questions we had about
     the time line you gave us.

[434294]
_page : 600
_tape : Tape 81/6
CC:  Okay. Let me take a check here and see if there
     is anything anybody else wants to input to you,
     right now.

[434334]
_page : 601
_tape : Tape 81/7
CC: Aquarius, Houston.

[434338]
_page : 601
_tape : Tape 81/7
CDR: Go ahead.

[434339]
_page : 601
_tape : Tape 81/7
CC:  Roger. One detail that I thought you ought to
     know about the service module JETT is that we're
     going to recommend a push-pull maneuver, that is
     in the attitude I described. We'll want you to
     go half a foot per second plus-X on the LM, then
     jettison the service module, then go half a foot
     per second minus-X, which will be less time because you're suddenly a heck of a lot lighter.
     Over.

[434373]
_page : 601
_tape : Tape 81/7
CDR: Okay. Understand. You want me to go a half a
     foot per second plus-X, JETT the service module,
     and go a half a foot per second minus-X.

[434385]
_page : 601
_tape : Tape 81/7
CC:  That's affirm. We think that will give you plenty
     of separation, and also will be a slow enough rate
     so you'll have a chance to get some photos.

[434466]
_page : 601
_tape : Tape 81/7
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[434468]
_page : 601
_tape : Tape 81/7
CDR: Go ahead.

[434470]
_page : 601
_tape : Tape 81/7
CC:  Okay. One more thing we want to update you on
     with a little detail. As we told you, the ascent
     SEP attitude was in plane and the LM JETT attitude will be more similar to a normal service
     module SEP attitude, that is it will be LM up,
     out the radius vector and 45 degrees right, out
     of plane toward the south. We are going to recommend that prior to JETT, the configuration be
     with the LM overhead hatch closed, with the vent
     valve open, and we'll JETT with the tunnel
     pressurized. Over.

[434530]
_page : 601
_tape : Tape 81/7
CDR: Okay, Joe. Understand that the LM JETT
     attitude will be similar to service module
     normal jettison, which will be up and out of
     plane, and as soon as I finish maneuvering to
     left JETT attitude, I'll scramble up and close
     the LM hatch, making sure the vent valve is open,
     and then we'll vent it - or jettison it with
     the tunnel pressurized.

[434556]
_page : 601
_tape : Tape 81/7
_extra : 
CC:  That's affirmative. And Deke says don't forget
     to close the command module hatch on your way
     in.

[434565]
_page : 602
_tape : Tape 81/5
CDR: I'm already scared that Jack will have it closed
     before I get up there.

[434569]
_page : 602
_tape : Tape 81/5
CC:  (Laughter)

[434588]
_page : 602
_tape : Tape 81/5
CC:  Okay, Jim. I think that's about all we have
     for you right now. Whenever you feel like you
     don't have any more questions at the moment,
     we'd like you to reeonfigure for down voice
     backup and we'd like you to do that to move
     the VOICE FUNCTION switch to DOWNVOICE BACKUP
     as usual, but instead of pulling the circuit
     breaker, we'd like you to throw the POWER AMP
     switch to off.

[434640]
_page : 602
_tape : Tape 81/5
CDR: Okay, Joe. I have one more question, here. If
     we get a little bit ahead of time on the command
     module full powerup after we Jettison the service module, I'd like to go to LM JETT attitude
     early, and make sure we get that part squared
     away and sit there for a while before LM JETT
     of 1 hour. Now, will we be using LM power up
     to that time? There's two cables which we'll
     probably have to disconnect on the way up
     through the tunnel if we're still going to use
     LM power?

[434670]
_page : 602
_tape : Tape 81/5
CC:  That's affirmative. Let me get word on when we
     expect to go off LM power.

[434694]
_page : 602
_tape : Tape 81/5
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[434698]
_page : 602
_tape : Tape 81/5
CDR: Go ahead.

[434699]
_page : 602
_tape : Tape 81/5
CC:  Roger. We expect to go off LM power at the time
     we start powering up the CSM or about minus 2-1/2
     hours. That is not a hard number, and we'll be
     updating you on it. As far as going to the LM
     JETT attitude, that's completely permissible
     as soon as you have a powered up command module
     and a satisfactory platform, you can go there
     immediately. We're giving you a maximum of
     1 hour just for grins. Over.

[434734]
_page : 602
_tape : Tape 81/5
CDR: Okay. Fine. And that will be a LM maneuver,
     I assume, because we lost the service module,
     so no strain there.

[434742]
_page : 602
_tape : Tape 81/5

[434765]
_page : 603
_tape : Tape 81/9
CC:  6.50 degrees. And, Jim, Houston. I guess, as
     a last item, we expect that it will take us
     about an hour to update your checklist and
     your time lines sometime later on today, and
     we'd just like you to consider that. I expect
     it'll be 3 or 4 hours before we have all that
     stuff ready.

_tape : Tape 82/2
CDR: This is the LM to command module transfer, and
     this is the Delta from the launch stowage. Number 1: DSEA ...; number 2: LM flight data file

[438983]
_page : 606
_tape : Tape 82/2
CC:  Okay, that's affirm, Jim. We had a lot of noise,
     and we didn't get the middle part, but I think
     that's fairly - should be fairly clear to you,
     and don't bother with the readbaek of that that
     we missed, unless you have any doubts. And then
     I'll, if you're ready to copy, I'll give you the
     second list.

[439007]
_page : 606
_tape : Tape 82/2
CDR: Okay.

[439009]
_page : 606
_tape : Tape 82/2
CC:  Okay. This is CM to LM equipment transfer. Cabin
     fan filter and bag, and that, in the LM, should go
     in the ISA. Okay, next: decontamination bags,
     except for the ones used to wrap camera, should
     go in the ISA.

[439053]
_page : 606
_tape : Tape 82/2
CC:  Okay. Two LCGs, if you don't have them on already,
     to the IS - ISA. I realize you wouldn't have them
     on, because you're cold enough already.

[439077]
_page : 606
_tape : Tape 82/2
CDR: That's right.

[439079]
_page : 606
_tape : Tape 82/2
CC:  Okay, and finally, four Li0H cans, the ones used
     in the LM, and those can go in the jettison bag
     in the LM. Okay, a couple of notes. After loading the ISA, recommend secure it to the righthand restraint system.

[439120]
_page : 606
_tape : Tape 82/2
CC:  And secure the jettison bag to the PLSS on the
     floor. And that's all.

[439147]
_page : 606
_tape : Tape 82/2
CDR: Okay, Vance. This is command module to LM: cabin
     fan filter and bag in the ISA; decontamination
     bags, except for the ones we use for the TV camera,
     in the ISA; two LCGs in the ISA; four L0iH [sic]
     cans in the JETT bag; and we'll secure the ISA on
     the right-hand side - on the right-hand restraint
     system, and we'll secure the JETT bags to the PLSS
     on the floor.

     here. Only thing is, we'll probably lose data
     and probably voice, too, during a portion of each
     roll. So you might expect that. The other thing
     is, if anyone has on any BIOMED, would you switch
     your switch to - your BIOMED switch to that
     position.

     the way we got this thing arranged, we have one

     the helmet, so the other people are free to
     maneuver.

_tape : Tape 82/4
CC:  Jim, when you get finished moving your stowage
     around and it's convenient, we'd like to terminate
     the battery charge for a little while to bring up
     the CM TM so we can take a look at the temperatures
     again, like we did yesterday. Advise that right
     now on your batteries, you have 111 amp-hours;
     and, eventually, we hope to have them up - peaked
     up to about 116. One other point, we - we can
     either read that procedure up again which involves
     cranking up the telemetry, or, if Jack still has
     it, we can use his notes and - but I have one or
     two changes to - to make on them. Over.

[440771]
_page : 608
_tape : Tape 82/4
CDR: Okay, understand that you'll want us to terminate
     battery charge for a while, and crank up the CM
     TM to read out temperatures. And you have a few
     changes to Jack's checklist, and I'll turn the
     COMM over here to Jack shortly, as soon as he's
     finished, and we'll get along with it.

[440793]

     battery charge on battery A.

[441733]
_page : 609
_tape : Tape 82/5
CC:  That's affirm, Jack. Request to - Before you
     terminate it, get the usual readout on voltage
     and current; and we'd also like a time of termination, and understand you have the termination
     procedures. Is that affirm?

[441755]
_page : 609
_tape : Tape 82/5
CMP: Okay. That's affirm. Stand by. Let me just
     make sure I've got everything here before I go
     off on a tangent.

[441763]
_page : 609
_tape : Tape 82/5
CC:  Okay, Jack, and your battery-charge termination
     procedure remains unchanged, but when we go to
     power up the CM and look at your TM, we have a
     couple of additional steps.

[441803]
_page : 609
_tape : Tape 82/5
CMP: Okay. Vance, I do have the procedure for stopping
     the battery charge. And do you want me to copy
     this procedure now, or do you want me to come back
     and give you the volt, amps, and time and - after
     I complete this termination?

[441827]
_page : 609
_tape : Tape 82/5
CC:  Okay. Just - Just give us the volts and amps
     Just before you start the termination of the procedure, and understand you say you have the
     charge - the procedure for taking the charge off.
     Is that affirm?

[441849]
_page : 609
_tape : Tape 82/5
CMP: That's affirm.

[441851]

CC:  Negative. Unless you want me to. I'll tell you
     what; I could run through it very quickly Just
     to verify that we're getting started off on the
     correct path here.

[441871]
_page : 609
_tape : Tape 82/5

     I have is panel BAT CHARGE to OFF on panel 3; AC
     INVERTER 2, OFF; panel 5: MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C
     ON; panel 250: CB BAT A POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING,
     open; panel 275: INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, open;
     and then, the - just to go ahead and reverse the
     position of the switches and circuit breakers
     that I started out with, and these don't have to
     be in reverse order. Is that Charlie?

_page : 610
_tape : Tape 82/6

     been doing some spring housecleaning, moving
     stowage around up there.

[442060]
_page : 610
_tape : Tape 82/6
LMP: Boy, you wouldn't believe this LM right now; it's
     nothing but bags from floor to ceiling.

[442066]
_page : 610
_tape : Tape 82/6
CC:  Hey, that brings up a question. We were wondering
     where you guys plan to stow the probe and drogue?
     It occurred to us that one possibility was to stow
     it in the LM, down about where the LMP normally
     stands, underneath the IS - ISAer. Perhaps you
     have a better idea. Over.

[442092]
_page : 610
_tape : Tape 82/6
LMP: Yes, I do, Vance. ... would go in the LM, but I
     thought maybe we ought to stow it where the CDR
     stands. How's that?

[442102]
_page : 610
_tape : Tape 82/6
CC:  Okay. I can tell that you're just getting -
     getting that one over because Jim Just got off
     the loop.

[442113]
_page : 611
_tape : Tape 82/7
LMP: Yes, he's sleeping. No, that's - that's actually
     where we normally had been stowing it for normal
     LM JETTs.

[442124]
_page : 611
_tape : Tape 82/7
CC:  Okay, and - Hey, we just - we'll record that, and
     figure that you'll stow the probe and drogue over
     in the - where the CDR stands. We have a - a
     change to this - equipment transfer list that I
     just read up to Jim. Why don't you make a note
     of this one item? Forget about the LM - -

[442147]

     that - all that on it. Why don't you hold it
     until Jack gets done doing the battery charge?

[442164]
_page : 611
_tape : Tape 82/7
CC:  Okay.

[442179]

[442184]
_page : 611
_tape : Tape 82/7
LMP: Okay. And there was one piece of flight data
     that we needed that we didn't bring along this
     time.

[442200]
_page : 611

     you just need scratch paper, don't you?

_tape : Tape 82/7
LMP: Yes.

[442288]
_page : 611

LMP: Okay, Vance. I got the stowage list now.

[442292]
_page : 611
_tape : Tape 82/7

[442293]
_page : 611

     the - secured the battery charge now.

[442304]
_page : 611
_tape : Tape 82/7
CC:  Okay, and we're recording the time that that was
     complete. You have two lists there, one is LM
     to CM equipment transfer and the second list is
     the reverse. Request you scratch the last item
     on the first list, which is returning used bags
     to the CM.

[442331]

_page : 612
_tape : Tape 82/8

     the procedures that I used before to get telemetry
     and to check out the CSM system?

[442507]
_page : 612
_tape : Tape 82/8
CC:  Yes, that's correct, Jack; they're pretty simple.
     About halfway through the procedure, we have a
     step on panel 3, which is POWER AMPL, HIGH; we'd
     like to change that to POWER AMPL, LOW.

[442529]
_page : 612
_tape : Tape 82/8
CMP: Okay. Copy. POWER AMPL, LOW.

[442533]
_page : 612
_tape : Tape 82/8

     the step "CB MAIN B, BAT B, close - BAT BUS B,
     close."

[442550]
_page : 612
_tape : Tape 82/8

     BAT BUS B, close."

[442555]

[442567]
_page : 612
_tape : Tape 82/8

     TM up for about 5 or 10 minutes to look at the
     data from the CM; look at your temperatures,
     et cetera. And after that, we'll go back to
     charging the battery again, and the charge will
     probably go until around GET 126.

     that there is no mistaking the procedure, it
     starts out for the backout part: panel 3, POWER
     AMPL, OFF; TRANSPONDER, OFF; AC INVERTER 2, OFF;
     then goes to panel 250, et cetera.

     putting the black-and-white TV camera on top of
     A-7 in an A ... decontamination bag, I was
     wondering if it would be possible or if you -
     there would be any problem in putting it into

     that and get back with you. Okay?

[442690]
_page : 613
_tape : Tape 82/9
CMP: All right. I was Just thinking. I'm trying to
     get as much weight as possible down there in that
     LEB. We have no SRCs and then our waste tank
     is - you know - rather depleted. I think it's
     about down to 40 percent or so. So I'm trying
     to get as much L over D as I can, and any heavy

     That's the 70-millimeter DC Reseau camera,
     Hasselblad, that is, with the 80-millimeter lens,
     from box A-13. Suggest fresh magazine of 3400
     black-and-white film.

[448862]
_page : 622
_tape : Tape 83/7
CDR: Okay.

[448866]
_page : 622
_tape : Tape 83/7
CC:  Okay. Suggest either magazine R or magazine S
     from A-13. Transfer all of this to the LM and
     recommend the following settings: LM/DC/80/BW
     3400 (f:5.6 at a 250th).

[448920]
_page : 622
_tape : Tape 83/7
CC:  And that's all for that one.

[448924]
_page : 622
_tape : Tape 83/7
CDR: Okay, Vance. Let me see if I have it here. For
     the LM, want to mse the 70-millimeter DC
     Hasselblad 80-millimeter lens in A-13, using
     3400 black-and-white film MAGs R or S. Prepare
     to take camera to the LM, and the setting would
     be the LM/DC/80/BW 3400 (f:5.6) at a 250th.

[448948]
_page : 622
_tape : Tape 83/7
_extra : 
CC:  That's correct. Okay. Next: the next camera -
     Stand by 1. I've got noise here. Okay. The
     next LM - The next camera for the LM will be the
     16-millimeter, and these photos are considered
     to be priority 3. Okay. One, get the
     16-millimeter DAC and powerpack from A-8. Get
     the 10-millimeter lens, and remove it - remove
     the 10-millimeter lens, and take the 18-millimeter
     lens from B-3 and attach it to the camera. And
     attach the power cable transfer to the LM, set
     frame rate at 12 frames per second, and the same
     data line that I gave you before reads this way
     this time. LM/DAC/18/CEX, battery (f:8 and
     1/250th). Okay. Now looking at these two cameras
     in the LM, it's recommended that you use the
     16-millimeter for the first 2-1/2 minutes and
     then switch to the 70-millimeter. That's partly
     because the frame's been - or the - They've been
     optimized for closer and longer range. Okay.
     Read back, please.

[449099]
_page : 623
_tape : Tape 83/8
CDR: Okay, Vance. Essentially, what you wanted to
     use as far as the movie camera in the LM goes,
     is our lunar sequence camera which is attached
     to the powerpack. We use the 18-millimeter lens,
     set it at 12 frames per second ... f:8 at 250th
     of a second.

[449122]
_page : 623
_tape : Tape 83/8
CC:  Roger. f:8 at 250th.

[449130]
_page : 623
_tape : Tape 83/8
CDR: Right; f:8 at 250th.

[449135]
_page : 623
_tape : Tape 83/8
CC:  Okay. Would you believe that we have a correction now to the last camera I gave you? Correct
     that 18-millimeter lens to 75-millimeter lens.

[449152]
_page : 623
_tape : Tape 83/8
CDR: Okay. The 18-millimeter to the 75-millimeter
     lens. Okay.

[449157]
_page : 623
_tape : Tape 83/8
_extra : 
CC:  Right. Okay. Next for the command module pictures, it may be a little hard to see the service
     module from the command module, but if you can
     see it, it will be through window 5, people down
     here think. Recommend for that the CM 70-millimeter. These photos have priority 2. So
     this is 70-millimeter EL, with - which has the
     80-millimeter attached, and this is all in B-3.
     Take off the 80-millimeter lens and attach the
     250-millimeter lens. And the 250-millimeter
     lens can be found in U-4. Use CEX film from
     A-13. Ring sight from A-7, and these pictures
     will be f:8 at a 250th. And I think probably
     by now you probably all have - already have
     these cameras configured, and this may be redundant information, but here it is anyway. Over.

[449246]
_page : 624
_tape : Tape 83/9
CDR: Okay, Vance. You're right. We do have cameras
     almost configured like you said. For the command
     module, you think that the EL with the 250 lens,
     CEX film, f:8 at a 250th is the best bet, and
     you're saying now that where you think you'll see
     it is out window 5? Is that it?

[449268]
_page : 624
_tape : Tape 83/9
CC:  That's right, Jim.

[449272]
_page : 624
_tape : Tape 83/9
CDR: Okay. My procedure, now, after service module
     JETT is going to be to pitch up, in order to try
     to get the service module into the - to get the
     center window in view of the service module,
     which we are going to have somebody there - to
     photograph. Why do you think window 5 will be
     it?

[449896]
_page : 625
_tape : Tape 82/1
CC:  Jim, regarding window 5, I have a drawing here;
     and, when you're docked, you have approximately
     a 60-degree angle between the Z-axes of the two
     spacecraft. It appears that peering out window 5, you would be looking at the rendezvous
     radar on top of the LM which would, if you
     pitched, more or less give you a view of the
     service module. That is, if you pitched, so -
     from - and I think that this has been run by
     quite a few folks here; so, offhand, I can't see
     where any other window would be as good or perhaps even possible.

[449952]
_page : 625
_tape : Tape 82/1
CDR: Okay. I understand. Yes, you're right. When
     we look out window 5, we can see rendezvous
     radar, and we'll try - We'll try window 5.

[449961]
_page : 625

CC:  Okay. I'll read them fast first here so you
     get a general idea. LM pad, service module
     JETT attitude, Moon viewing attitude, Sun
     viewing attitude, and LM JETT attitude. The
     CM pads are coarse aline angles for LM attitudes
     during Moon and Sun sightings, coarse aline
     angles for entry REFSMMAT, and CMC angles on
     entry REFSMMAT for LM JETT. Moon viewing, and
     entry. Okay. That - That's general pad information. If you want, I'll read it slowly so you
     can copy it all down; otherwise, I'll go ahead.

[452181]
_page : 628
_tape : Tape 84/4

     going to have a pretty good hack on the LM here
     in the next few hours, and we anticipate letting
     you fill your own tanks before we transfer over,
     so you should be in reasonably good shape there.

[452892]
_page : 629
_tape : Tape 84/5
CMP: Okay. We have a number of juice bags all out
     and ready to go, and we tried to get the water
     out of the command module about 20 minutes ago
     and found out that the command module's potable
     tank was empty. So we have no bags made up now,
     so we're dependent on LM water, PLSS water.

[452919]
_page : 629
_tape : Tape 84/5
F: Roger. If you feel like trying the PLSS, that's
     all excess, and you might want to try that at
     any time. I'm sure it'll taste like PLSS but
     you might as well try it.

     module are heavily coated with water right now.
     So I don't know what kind of pictures we'll get
     out of them, but I'm going to try and clean them
     off and do the best I can with the 250-millimeter
     lens on the Hasselblad.

_tape : Tape 84/7
CMP: Okay, Vance. I put BAT Baker on charge; I don't
     think it quite had stabilized. It was reading
     1.1 amps, 39.6 volts when I left up there.

[453782]
_page : 631

[453894]
_page : 631
_tape : Tape 84/7
CC:  Jack, we're going to need readings on the BAT
     volt and charger amps about every 10 or 15 minutes for a while, so is there somebody else that
     can be reading them out while you're copying?
     Over.

[453910]
_page : 631
_tape : Tape 84/7
CMP: Yes. Jim will take a run up there. Fred-o is
     sleeping right now. We're trying to get some
     sleep here, and Jim'll run up and take a look
     at voltage and current whenever you call.

_tape : Tape 84/8
CDR: Vance, we've got to realize that we've got to
     establish a work-rest cycle up here, so we just
     can't wait around here to just read procedures
     all the time up to the burn. We've got to get
     them up here, look at them, and then we've got
     to get the people to sleep. So take that into

CMP: Okay. Can we - Since the first part of it, you're
     just going to read and I'm going to copy and
     we're going to have a question and answer period
     later, can we get started?

[454432]
_page : 633

[454490]
_page : 633
_tape : Tape 84/9
CC:  Okay. Let me take it from the top here. Just -
     there might be some overlap, but to make sure
     we're all on the same signal. We're starting
     off with a set of time line procedures that are
     going to give us - end up with the normal entry
     checklist. There will be some checklist changes
     into the book, but the bulk of what I have for
     you is the time line stuff. And it starts at
     6 hours and 30 minutes prior to EI and assumes
     that we're getting LM power to MAIN B in the
     command module. I think you already have the
     numbers for the LM pads and the comand module
     pads; I mean the types of pads we'll be giving
     you. And if you have a question on what they'll
     be doing or what they're for, I can go over
     those now or when we get through.

[454542]
_page : 633
_tape : Tape 84/9
CMP: Okay. Yes, I'll make a little note there, and
     we'll discuss it when we get everything copied,
     huh?

[454550]
_page : 633
_tape : Tape 84/9
CC:  All right. And the first item, then, after
     you get ready to start this checklist, is to
     install lithium hydroxide canisters and to stow
     ORDEAL. On panel 8, we want to turn the
     FLOODLIGHTS to FIXED.

[454568]
_page : 633
_tape : Tape 84/9

     here.

[454571]
_page : 633
_tape : Tape 84/9
CC:  Okay. I'll tell you. I'll go line at a time
     and wait for your verification before I go on to
     the next one. I have panel 8, FLOODLIGHTS,
     FIXED,

[454598]
_page : 634
_tape : Tape 84/10
CC: Okay. Install LiOH canisters, stow ORDEAL,
     FLOODLIGHTS, FIXED.

[454602]
_page : 634
_tape : Tape 84/10
CC: Okay. That's the panel 8 floodlights. Now
     we're going to take panel 5 and put the FLOODLIGHT
     rheostat to FLOOD and the LEB, that's panel 100,
     FLOODLIGHTS are also going to FIXED. And the
     purpose of this is to balance up buses A and B.

[454625]
_page : 634
_tape : Tape 84/10

     that's Delta Charlie, BUS A and B, closed.

[455296]
_page : 638
_tape : Tape 85/1
CMP: Okay. CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, DC BUS A and B, close.
     And I'll give you the volts and amps.

[455307]
_page : 638

[455359]
_page : 638
_tape : Tape 85/1
CMP: Okay. MAIN BUS A and B, RESET, then center.

[455367]
_page : 638
_tape : Tape 85/1
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay, now we're at EI
     minus 5 plus 05. And, as far as you're concerned,
     Jack, the command module is using this for information only. This will be the LM doing an Earth-terminator AGS alinement; and at the time of
     5 plus 05 is the time they'll be going ahead and
     releasing their ball. And this will be covered
     in the LM checklist; it'll be uplinked after this
     one. At EI minus 5, we perform midcourse number 7. Over.

[455416]
_page : 638
_tape : Tape 85/1
CMP: Okay. At EI minus 05:05, the LM is making an
     Earth-terminator aline; and at EI minus 05:00,
     we perform MCC-7.

[455427]
_page : 638
_tape : Tape 85/1
CC:  That's correct. At the completion of midcourse 7, the LM will maneuver to a separation
     attitude. And this attitude will be sent up
     on one of the pads that you're going to get
     before all the sequence starts. And it'll be
     flown to the LM ball angles on that pad.

[455447]
_page : 638
_tape : Tape 85/1
CMP: Okay. Understand.

[455450]
_page : 638
_tape : Tape 85/1
CC:  All right. At EI minus 4 plus 40, we want to
     perform page 1-6, step 39 of the entry checklist.

[455467]
_page : 639
_tape : Tape 85/2
CMP: Ken, I - I didn't get it. We had to change
     OMNI's again. Could you say it - the EI minus
     4 dash - or 04:40, we do something.

[455475]
_page : 639
_tape : Tape 85/2
CC:  Okay. And at that time, you'll want to perform
     step 39 of page E/1-6. Over.

[455491]
_page : 639
_tape : Tape 85/2
CMP: Okay. Perform step 39 of entry checklist
     page E/1-6.

[455499]
_page : 639
_tape : Tape 85/2
CC:  That's correct. Okay. The next is the command
     module RCS activation, and that's step 4-1 of
     page E/1-6.

[455533]
_page : 639
_tape : Tape 85/2

[455548]
_page : 639
_tape : Tape 85/2
CC:  That's correct.

[455561]
_page : 639
_tape : Tape 85/2
CC: All right, Jack. The next is at EI minus 4
     plus 30. We want to verify that the LM is
     configured for command module RCS hotfire.

[455588]
_page : 639
_tape : Tape 85/2

_tape : Tape 85/3
CMP: Panel 2: RCS COMMAND, ON.

[455725]
_page : 640
_tape : Tape 85/3

     check per step 4 of page E/2-1.

[455744]
_page : 640
_tape : Tape 85/3

     ARM, two to ARM.

[455797]
_page : 640
_tape : Tape 85/3
CMP: Okay. Panel 8: set FYRO ARM, two, to ARM. Do
     I get a MSFN GO for that?

[455803]
_page : 640
_tape : Tape 85/3
CC: That's negative, Jack. We haven't powered up
     any of the downlink at this time. You'll be
     doing this and the command module RCS pressurization both by yourself.

[455817]
_page : 640
_tape : Tape 85/3
CMP: Okay.

[455820]
_page : 640
_tape : Tape 85/3
CC:  Okay. Now, the next event is going to be the
     separation of the service module, and these are
     some LM steps, but so that you will know what is
     going on, I'll read them to you. The LM will do
     a LM plus-X of one-half foot per second. Then
     you'll be hitting the CM SM SEP on and up, on
     their command. As soon as we are free of the
     service module, the LM will do another LM
     minus-X for 0.5 feet per second. This is called
     the push-pull maneuver. I think it was described
     this afternoon.

[455866]
_page : 640
_tape : Tape 85/3
CMP: Yes, Ken. It was, I heard about it.

[455869]
_page : 640
_tape : Tape 85/3
CC:  Okay. I just wanted you to know that's the
     sequence you're in. Okay. At the completion of
     that, we go back to panel 8, and it's SEQUENTIAL,
     PYRO ARM, both of them, to SAFE.

[455896]
_page : 640
_tape : Tape 85/3
CMP: Okay. Panel 8: SEQ PYRO ARM, two, to SAFE.

[455908]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CC: Okay. And following this, we take SEQUENTIAL,
     LOGIC, two, to OFF.

[455923]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CMP: Okay. LOGIC, two, to OFF.

[455928]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CC:  I'm sorry, Jack. I'1] have to ask you to repeat
     that.

[455938]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CMP: Okay. Panel 8: SEQ LOGIC, two, to OFF. Are
     they ON now, Ken? I don't remember turning them -
     I guess that's part of one of the other sequences,
     huh? That we turned them ON?

[455948]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CC:  That's affirm. The reason we're turning the
     logic off, Jack, is a power savings. So we'll
     be turning them off, and I'll ge getting them
     back on when we go to get off of the LM; and
     then turn them back off, then we'll be turning
     them on prior to entry. Just so you know what's
     coming.

[455965]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CMP: Okay, real fine.

[455968]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CC:  Okay. Then following this, the LM will pitch up
     to acquire the Moon - Excuse me, they're going to
     pitch up and acquire the service module and photograph, and they'll be using the ACA for rotations
     from now on. And you may see the LM out of window
     number 5 at the same time they pitch up to acquire
     it.

[456002]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CMP: Okay. The LM pitches up, acquires the service
     module and photographs it, and I should expect
     to find - might possibly see the service module
     out of window 5.

[456012]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay, now we're down to EI
     minus 3 hours, or the next time-event, and the LM
     starts a maneuver to what we call the Moon-view
     attitude. This maneuver is designed to place
     the command module optics pointing with zero
     zero at the Moon, and it will be flown to on the
     LM ball angle.

[456057]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CMP: Okay, the LM maneuvers to the Moon-viewing attitude which would place the Moon in the center of
     the command module optics with them at zero zero.

[456068]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay, now we're going to
     panel 5, and it's circuit breaker G&N, COMPUTER,
     MAIN B, closed.

[456081]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CMP: Okay. Panel 5: CB G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN B, closed.

[456095]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CC: That's affirmative. Now you're going to come
     up with a 37 ENTER 06 ENTER most likely on the
     computer. And what we want to do is to put the
     computer to standby; if you come up with a
     37 06, you'll have to do an ENTER in order to
     get the code 62. If it's got 62 on it, you can
     do a PROCEED until the DSKY blanks. You might
     remember that the AC is still off at this time
     so you won't be getting the STANDBY status light,
     and your cue that the computer is indeed in
     standby is when the DSKY goes blank.

[456136]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CMP: Okay. You're saying that I will probably get
     a PROGRAM 06 with a VERB 37 ENTER flashing.

[456147]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CC: I expect that you - -

[456148]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CMP: ENTER 06.

[456149]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CC:  I expect you are - -

[456150]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CMP: Say again, Ken.

[456152]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CC:  Yes. We think that you're going to come up
     with a 37 06 already in the DSKY. If you do,
     do an ENTER and that should take you to the
     code 00062, which is the request for standby.
     And when you get that, hit PROCEED until the
     DSKY blanks. If you come up with something
     else, that's where we want to end up anyhow.
     With either, when you get the code 62 when it
     comes up, just do a PROCEED on it.

[456185]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CMP: Okay. Is there anything else I could get?

[456192]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CC: I don't believe so, Jack. That's one that when
     you get to that step, if you do get something
     else, we will be standing by to see that you
     see. The whole scheme is to go to standby.

[456203]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CMP: Will you be getting it on downlink?

[456205]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CC:  No, sir. We don't have that powered up yet.

[456209]
_page : 642

CMP: Okay. I'll yell to Jim, and Jim will give you
     a call.

[456213]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CC:  Okay. The basic thing, Jack, is just to get
     the computer in standby to save power.

[456220]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CMP: Okay.

[456221]
_page : 643

     ahead of LM POWER?

[456351]
_page : 643
_tape : 85/6

     closed, goes before CB LM POWER-1 and -2, open.

[456359]
_page : 643
_tape : 85/6
CC:  That's correct. Jack, what we're doing is we've
     had the LM powering MAIN B, and we've had all
     these particular loads on it, and we're getting
     ready to secure LM power so we wanted to make
     sure that essential things like the computer,

_page : 647
_tape : 85/10
CC:  That's affirm. Okay. Now, we are getting
     ready to start the alinement sequence, and are
     you familiar with the general sequence of events
     we're going to use, Jack?

[457229]
_page : 647
_tape : 85/10
CMP: How do you mean? We are going to make an alinement on the Moon and on the Sun; other than that -
     I didn't get any - I wasn't on the headset when
     the general information was passed up, so if
     there was any more than that, I didn't get it.

[457245]
_page : 648
_tape : 85/11
CC: Okay. Basically, that is correct. Let me just
     run through it hand-waving-type for a minute,
     and then I'll read you the steps. I think it
     will make more sense. The scheme is that the
     LM can fly to a set of ball angles that will
     point your optics at the Moon. Now, at any time,
     in any attitude that we happen to be at, if
     you can look in the telescope and recognize star
     patterns sufficient that you believe you can
     make an alinement all on your own, that's the
     place we'd like to break off and let you go ahead
     and take over with your own alinement. However,
     we are giving you a procedure which will give you
     things we know you can see in the telescope without worrying about any reflections or anything
     of that nature, and it's not intended that this
     procedure has to be followed past the point where
     you know you've got good definition of star
     patterns in your telescope. If you need to go
     on, we'll maneuver, take a look at the Moon,
     we'll take a mark there, and then we'll maneuver
     with the LM/FDAI angles again and take a look at
     the Sun, and get yourself another mark on the
     Sun and that will complete the alinement. Now,
     the alinement scheme is that we are going to give
     you a set of angles that you can coarse aline the
     ball through when the LM is pointing you at the
     Moon. Now, this set of angles will agree with
     the REFSMMAT that you have in as a nominal
     REFSMMAT in you CMC. You can coarse aline to that,
     set a drift flag and EEFSMMAT flag, and you'll
     have a good platform and we'll be within a
     couple of degrees of a good alinement. And, if
     we have to, we could break off at this point and
     go ahead with an entry; however, in an attempt
     to get a good platform, we are going to have you
     then do a P52 option 1, and what you are going to
     find in the option 1 slots in the entry REFSMMAT.
     You'll come up with the NOUN 22 values, and we
     intend to go ahead and coarse aline the ball to
     the entry REFSMMAT attitude, and then we'll go
     ahead and take marks through a normal P52
     sequence. So that's the general scheme that
     we are going to use. If you think you have a
     handle on that, I will go ahead and read you
     the steps.

[457391]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: Okay. Well, let me ask a question. The LM
     maneuvers to a set of Moon-viewing angles. Okay,
     at this time, I am going to do a P52, is that
     right? With the planet option?

[457409]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  The first thing we arc going to do is to coarse
     aline the platform and get it inertial, based on
     the REFSMMAT that you have in the present slot
     inside the CMC. We'll then go - and do a P52,
     option 4 - Correction, option 1.

[457428]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: Okay - That's after the LM gets established at
     the attitude. Jim says I'm here at the Moon-viewing attitude, I do a VERB 41 NOUN 20 to the
     set of angles that you're going to give me in
     the pad.

[457440]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  That's affirmative - -

[457441]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: And then I enter the P52.

[457443]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  That's correct.

[457444]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: Okay. Then enter the P52 and that's an
     option 3, right?

[457451]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  The P52 will be done as an option 1. The only
     reason you have the other REFSMMAT inside the
     computer is that in order to set the REFSMMAT
     flag, you need some relative orientation.

[457462]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: Okay. I see. I do a P52 option 1, and when do
     I set the REFSMMAT flag and the drift flag?

[457473]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  That will be before entering P52. I am going to
     give you this procedure in detail.

[457478]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: Okay. All right. Let's go at it. Maybe it'll
     all fall out and I won't have any questions.
     Go ahead.

[457485]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  Okay. I'm ready to start reading again. We
     start with a VERB 41 NOUN 20.

[457508]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: Okay. When the LM is in the Moon-viewing attitude,
     I do a VERB 41 NOUN 20, ENTER.

[457514]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  That's right. And you'll put in the attitudes
     that you'll get from one of the pads, and this
     will be for the coarse aline angles when the LM
     is at the Moon-viewing attitude. Then when
     they're all squared away, I tell you they have
     the right attitude; we then pick up again with
     a VERB 40 NOUN 20, ENTER.

[457545]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CMP: Okay. VERB 40 NOUN 20, ENTER when Moon is -
     the LM is satisfied that they're at the Moon-viewing attitude.

[457553]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CC:  That's correct. Now we're going to set the
     REFSMMAT and drift flags according to the G&C
     checklist, page G/7-1, steps 3 and 4.

[457575]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CMP: Okay. Set the REFSMMAT flag for G&C 7-1,
     steps 3 and 4.

[457580]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CC:  That's correct. Now VERB 37, ENTER; 52, ENTER;
     option 1.

[457593]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CMP: VERB 37, ENTER; 52, ENTER; option 1.

[457596]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CC:  That's correct. And we'll do the coarse aline.

[457609]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CMP: Okay. Perform the coarse aline function.

[457613]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CC:  Okay. Now when it gets back to the mark routines, we want to take a mark on the Moon.

[457626]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CMP: Okay. Mark on the Moon with the crosshairs in
     the center. Is that right?

[457630]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay. When that's complete,
     the LM will maneuver to the Sun-viewing angle
     for attitude. And when they get there, you take
     a mark on the Sun using the Sun filter and the
     telescope; and, again, we're marking on the
     center.

[457659]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CMP: Okay. Now, let me ask you a question. Is the
     first mark on the Moon made with the - are all
     these made with the telescope and not the
     sextant?

[457669]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CC:  If - I'm not sure right offhand what the angular
     size of the Moon is, Jack. If you can get it in
     the sextant; that's the best thing to do, but
     you may have to go into the telescope in order
     to define the center. Either one's acceptable.

[457684]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: Okay. If I can define the center through the
     sextant, do it that way. And if I can't, use
     the telescope.

[457690]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  That's affirmed. We know you're going to use
     the telescope on the Sun.

[457703]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  Okay. You ready to press on?

[457709]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: I'm ready.

[457710]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  Okay. Just reminded we owe somebody a BAT B
     voltage.

[457717]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: Okay, another volts ard amps coming up.

[457720]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  All right. Thank you. And this left us in P52
     with two marks, and we'll go ahead and torque
     the NOUN 93s.

[457743]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: Okay. ... torque the NOUN 93s, after the two
     marks.

[457748]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  Okay. So that gives us a good platform. Now
     the LM will maneuver to the jettison attitude,
     and the only thing of significance here is that
     you want to watch to make sure that the path
     they choose to go to the Jettison attitude
     avoids gimbal lock on your own platform.

[457778]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: Okay. The LM maneuvers to the jettison attitude
     and I just monitor the maneuver and yell at Jim
     if he gets near a gimbal lock.

[457786]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  That's affirmed. Okay, and then the LM will go
     to a MAX deadband attitude hold in the jettiscn
     attitude.

[457804]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: Okay. The LM goes to MAX deadband attitude hold.

[457809]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  Okay. Now we're ready to go back to work. The
     next thing we'll do is to continue to powerup
     procedures. Do you have any further questions
     on that alinement, Jack?

[457818]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: No. No. I think - I think it's all self-explanatory now.

[457823]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  Okay. The one thing that everybody would like
     for you to understand is we certainly don't
     insist on using the Moon and the Earth; if you
     find you have good stars, why use them. However,
     this alinement is more than adequate te give us
     a good guided entry.

[457840]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: Okay. If I get a set of good stars, do I start
     right out to a basic P51 and a P52 option 1?

[457850]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  That's affirmative.

[457853]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: Okay.

[457855]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  Okay. Now, we're ready to go to work on
     panel 275. And it starts with a circuit breaker
     MAIN A - -

[457861]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: Wait - wait just a minute. Wait just a minute.
     I owe you some volts and amps.

[457866]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  Okay. Ail right.

[457869]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: Okay. Volts are 39.4, amps, 1.25.

[457875]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  Okay. I thought maybe, your meter was stuck
     before.

[457880]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: No (laughter).

[457884]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  All right. You ready to go back to 275? Have
     a circuit breaker MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed.

[457902]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: CB MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed.

[457905]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  That's correct. And circuit breaker MAIN B,
     BAT C, closed.

[457917]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: CB MAIN Baker, BAT Charlie, closed.

[457920]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  Okay. That's correct. Now we're up to EI
     minus 1 plus 30. And at this time, we're going
     to proceed with the closeout and hatch installation.

[457950]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: Okay. Closeout and hatch installation at EI
     minus 01:30.

[457955]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  That's right, Jack, and we're going to close the
     IM hatch, and we'll make the dump valve in the
     LM hatch closed.

[457971]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: Understand you're going to close tile dump valve,
     now on the LM hatch, right?

[457976]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  That's correct.

[457977]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: Okay. This is a change from what we had understood previously.

[457981]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  That's correct.

[457983]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: I'm - Personally, I'm happy to see it, but that's
     good.

[457986]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  Okay. That's one vote on your side. Okay; and
     we're going to go ahead and do the - use the
     decal to perform the hatch installation, and
     we'll start on the hatch integrity check.

[458019]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: Okay. Per the decal, perform the hatch installation and start on the hatch integrity check.

[458029]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  That's correct.

[458033]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: Okay, Ken. One thing I think that - I don't
     know whether anybody - the decal don't take into
     account the fact that we still have the umbilicals connected. At what point in time should
     they be removed?

[458050]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  Okay, Jack. That doesn't matter. We're going
     to be separating the tunnel upstream of those
     umbilicals, and you can leave them right there.

[458064]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: Okay. Does it make any difference if we
     disengage - the LM - We have pulled the circuit
     breakers LM POWER-1 aad -2, so if we choose to
     disconnect these umbilicals, there's no harm,
     right?

[458081]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  That's right. No sweat. John Aaron's just
     saying that they may he hot. He's checking on
     it, so how about holding a decision on that and
     let me come back to you?

[458094]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: Okay.

[458099]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  Okay. And let me tell you what we're going to
     do since we told you a different story this
     afternoon on this tunnel. We're actually going
     to vent the tunnel down so that we end up with
     about 1-1/2 to 2 psi absolute in the tunnel.
     And this will give us a DELTA-P of 3. So we'll
     do our hatch integrity check at the same time
     we're venting the tunnel down.

[458124]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: Okay. It sounds good.

[458126]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  Okay. Now let me give you some plumbing switches
     here. Let's take the SURGE TANK OXYGEN valve
     to ON.

[458145]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: SURGE TANK 0<sub>2</sub> to ON.

[458148]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  All right. Take the MAIN REGs, two, OPEN.

[458159]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: MAIN REGs, two, to OPEN.

[458162]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  Okay. And the WATER AND GLYCOL TANK PRESSURE,
     the PRESSURE valve and the RELIEF valve to BOTH.

[458180]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: Okay, WATER AND GLYCOL TANKS PRESSURE and RELIEF
     valve to BOTH.

[458186]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  That's correct. And EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE
     valve to BOTH.

[458200]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE to BOTH.

[458203]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  That's correct; and the SUIT DEMAND REGs to BOTH.

[458215]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: SUIT DEMAND REGs to BOTH.

[458218]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  That's correct. Okay, now we're going to
     panel 5: circuit breaker ECS TRANSDUCERs, PRESSURE GROUP 1 and 2, MAIN A and MAIN B. That's
     four circuit breakers, closed.

[458246]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: ECS TRANSDUCERs, GROUP 1 and 2, MAIN A and
     MAIN B, four, to close.

[458252]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  That's correct. Okay, now. Circuit breaker
     ECS TRANSDUCER, TEMPERATURE, MAIN A and MAIN B,
     that's two of them, closed.

[458271]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: CB ECS TRANSDUCER, TEMPERATURE, MAIN A and
     MAIN B, closed.

[458277]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  That's correct. On panel 4: PRIMARY ECS
     GLYCOL PUMPS, one, to AC 1.

[458293]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: Primary ECS GLYCOL PUMPS to 1, AC1.

[458297]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  That's correct. Okay, then we'll finish going
     back to the tunnel vent, and verify the LM/CM
     DELTA-P and make sure it's been holding pressure. And we'll come back again and rehash all
     of the hatch integrity check and tunnel vent
     procedures with you. The next thing I want to
     read off is the EI minus 1 plus 20. We'll go to
     panel 7: BMAG number 1 POWER to WARM UP.

[458351]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: BMAG number 1 POWER to WARM UP.

[458355]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  That's correct. Then at EI minus 1 plus 10, we'll
     perform SCS powerup per checklist, page G/2-4.

[458375]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: Okay. Perform SCS powerup per G&C checklist,
     page 2-4.

[458382]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  That's correct. Okay, on panel 4: SUIT COMPRESSOR NUMBER 2 to AC1.

[458398]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: SUIT COMPRESSOR 2 to IC1.

[458401]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  That's correct. SPACECRAFT CONTROL to SCS.

_tape : 85/18
CMP: SPACECRAFT CONTROL to SCS.

[458423]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  Okay. And your MANUALK ATTITUDE switches, as you
     desire. We're coming up on jettison of the LM,
     so that's just like separation.

[458442]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: Okay.

[458444]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  Okay. And we'll do a GDC aline.

[458461]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: Okay. Perform a GDC aline.

[458463]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  Okay. On panel 8: ROTATION CONTROL POWER,
     DIRECT, 1 and 2, MAIN A/MAIN B.

[458489]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: Okay. These are circuit breakers, ROTATION
     CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, 1 and 2, MAIN A and
     MAIN B, closed.

[458502]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  Okay, Jack. I was thinking switch. Let me
     verify that's a circuit breaker, too. I think
     we have to get both of them.

[458512]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: Okay, there's those four circuit breakers over
     there, Ken. When you said panel 8, that's what
     I thought you were talking about. I don't
     think the circuit breakers are out right now,
     but why don't we just put - verify the circuit
     breakers and put the switches to MAIN A/MAIN B.

[458537]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CC: Okay, that's correct, Jack. Okay, at EI minus
     1 hour, we're going to be doing the LM jettison;
     so just prior to that, we want to do a P47.

[458567]

_tape : 85/19
CMP: Okay, say at about 1 minute prior to LM jettison,
     huh?

[458575]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CC:  Yes, just something that's comfortable for you.

[458587]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CMP: Okay.

[458588]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CC:  All right, after we've? done that, we want to get
     panel 8, SEQUENTIAL, PYRO ARM, two of them, ON.

[458605]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CMP: Okay. I get a GO fron MSFN for this?

[458612]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CC:  Okay, John says we can watch it.

[458623]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CMP: Okay.

[458624]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CC:  All right; the next thing is CSM/LM FINAL SEP,
     two of them, ON, up.

[458639]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CMP: CSM/LM FINAL SEP, two, ON.

[458642]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CC:  That's correct. Now we're going back to panel 8,
     and it's SEQUENTIAL, PYRO ARM, two of them, to
     SAFE.

[458668]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CMP: Okay. SEQ PYRO ARM, two, to SAFE.

[458671]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CC:  That's correct, and go back to POO.

[458682]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CMP: Okay. Go to POO.

[458684]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CC: All right. And now it's time to configure for
     single ring.

[458700]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CMP: Okay. Configure for single ring RCS.

[458703]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CC:  That's right, and since you're still an hour
     from EI, I guess it wouldn't hurt to use MINIMUM
     IMPULSE or something like that rather than the
     DAP, at least not until you get closer down.
     We'll have the DAP loads for you later.

[458725]
_page : 656
_tape : 85/19
CMP: ... - -

[458726]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CC:  Okay. And as soon as you've gotten yourself all
     set up with a good control mode, you want to
     maneuver Lo the entry attitude.

[458745]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CMP: Maneuver to entry attitude per the pad.

[458747]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CC:  That's correct. And we show EI minus 55, which
     really means when you get to the entry attitude,
     we have a sextant star check for you. And that
     will be on the pad.

[458771]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CMP: Okay. Perform a sextant star check.

[458774]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CC:  Okay. And I want to remind you to park the
     optics at 90 degrees of shaft.

[458780]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CMP: Okay. Say again why, Ken. I didn't understand
     that.

[458791]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CC:  Okay, this is just a precaution, Jack. If we
     park the optics with a 90-degree shaft angle,
     that will line up the slit's so it gives you the
     best airflow over that part of the heat shield
     and avoids a hot spot. If you don't remember
     it, I don't think it makes much difference. It's
     just good procedure.

[458812]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CMP: Okay.

[458815]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CC:  Okay. And after you've got it parked wherever
     you want it, well, turn the OPTICS POWER OFF
     and stow the optics.

[458834]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CMP: Okay. OPTICS POWER, OFF; stow the optics.

[458837]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CC:  Okay, that's good, Okay. The next thing we'll
     do is to initialize the EMS and that's on entry
     checklist page 2-1, step number 2.

[458860]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CMP: Okay, perform EMS initialization per entry
     checklist page 2-1, step 2.

[458866]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CC:  Okay, that's correct. Now we're coming up on
     EI minus 45 minutes, and we'll give you an entry
     pad and a final state vector.

[458892]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CMP: Okay, at minus 45, entry pad and final state
     vector from MSFN.

[458897]
_page : 657
_tape : 85/2O
CC:  Okay. Now we're going to perform what we call
     the Moon check. Rather than go into detail, if
     you already know what we're doing, just say so;
     otherwise, I'll describe the use of the 
     Moon-attitude set.

[458918]
_page : 658
_tape : 85/21
CMP: Maybe you better describe it.

[458921]
_page : 658
_tape : 85/21
CC:  Okay, Jack. You remember everybody in the past
     has commented on seeing Moonset just a couple
     minutes prior to EI, and your horizon will 
     probably be dark at the time that you get there;
     you're having an early morning entry; and coming
     in from the west, you'll still be looking at a
     dark horizon. So, just as a backup technique,
     just like you would track the horizon, we're
     going to give you an attitude which will be on
     the pad so that you can look directly at the
     Moon. This is an inertial attitude; it won't
     be changing, and you'll put the 36-degree window
     line on the Moon, and then just sit there and
     watch it. And just pr or to EI, the Earth will
     come up and occult it, and you will then have a
     good horizon check. And I have some times, and
     I'll give you that later. And if you just look
     at this thing now, at that point you can set the
     GDC or whatever you desire. And you will have a
     known attitude reference. It's just like a
     horizon check.

[458987]
_page : 658
_tape : 85/21
CMP: Okay, I maneuver to the Moon check attitude; at
     which time I put the 36 window line on the Moon,
     and just prior to EI, the Earth will occult the
     Moon.

[459003]
_page : 658
_tape : 85/21
CC:  That's correct. And that corresponds to the
     same inertial attitude that you'd have on the
     back of your entry card where it shows the 
     horizon attitude several minutes prior to EI; it's
     the same thing.

[459021]
_page : 658
_tape : 85/21
CMP: Yes, that's that one at 17 minutes prior. Okay.

[459024]
_page : 658
_tape : 85/21
CC:  Okay, and we're just getting it in a little
     closer. Okay, the next item on the check - checklist 
     here is an EI minus 40; we're going
     to panel 7, and it's BMAG NUMBER 2 POWER to
     WARM UP.

[459049]
_page : 658
_tape : 85/21
CMP: Okay, panel 7: BMAG NUMBER 2 POWER to WARM UP.

[459052]
_page : 658
_tape : 85/21
CC:  That's correct. Now, I'd like to verify the
     SURGE TANK and REPRESS PACKAGES are ON.

[459073]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CMP: Verify SURGE TANK and REPRESS PACKAGE are ON.

[459076]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CC: That's correct. On panel 5: circuit breaker
     ENVIRONMENTAL - CONTROL SYSTEM; WASTE WATER/
     URINE DUMP HEATER, two of them, closed.

[459104]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CMP: Panel 5: CB ECS, WASTE H<sub>2</sub>0/URINE DUMP HEATERS,
     two, to close.

[459111]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CC:  That's correct. SUIT COMPRESSOR number 2 to OFF.

[459127]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CMP: SUIT COMPRESSOR 2 to OFF.

[459129]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CC:  That's right, Jack, and what this - what we're
     planning to do in order to conserve power is
     we're going to run the suit compressor from an
     hour to this point at minus 40. And we'll be
     watching the PC0<sub>2</sub>; if that thing's working, we'll
     turn it off at the earliest time that we have a
     good cabin, and then we'll just leave it off.
     And in the event that the PCO<sub>2</sub> gage isn't working
     properly or something like that, well, we'll just
     go ahead and run it for this time frame.

[459160]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CMP: Okay, that sounds good.

[459163]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CC:  All right. Now we're at EI minus 30. SEQUENTIAL, 
     LOGIC, that's two of them, to ON, up.

[459177]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CMP: EI minus 30; SEQ, LOGIC, two, ON.

[459181]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CC:  Okay, in panel 7: the BMAG number 2 POWER to ON.

[459193]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CMP: Okay, we - you only gave that 10 minutes for the
     warmup, huh?

[459198]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CC:  That's okay.

[459200]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CMP: Okay.

[459202]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CC:  All right, and FDAI POWER to BOTH.

[459213]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CMP: FDAI POWER to BOTH.

[459216]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CC:  Okay. And we want to activate the primary
     evaporator.

[459234]
_page : 659
_tape : 55/22
CMP: Okay, activate the primary evaporator. All this
     time, Ken, what've we been getting our cooling?
     Right now, I think we have the radiators at PULL
     TO BYPASS.

[459243]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23
CC:  That's correct. We started out that way, and we
     turned the glycol pumps on, and we're just circulating 
     it internally. And we're counting on
     the command module being a heat sink; it's pretty
     cold soaked, and it looks like this is good
     enough. You got some relatively low heat loads - -

[459260]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23
CMP: Okay.

[459261]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23
CC:  - - and we'll keep watching the temps, and if
     we need it, why we'll start the evaporator early.

[459267]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23
CMP: Okay, that sounds good.

[459269]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23
CC:  Do you believe it's cold up there?

[459273]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23
CMP: Yes, and we used to call the command module the
     bedroom and it's now the refrigerator.

[459278]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23
CC:  Okay, just don't call it the reefer. Okay. At
     about EI minus 19, we get back into the standard
     entry checklist on page 2-2, where it starts
     with P61.

[459304]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23
CMP: Okay, at EI minus 19, we get back into the entry
     checklist at page 2-2, where we start entering
     P61.

[459314]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23
CC:  Okay, Jack. Now that's the - those are the
     time-line notes I had for you. I hate to tell
     you this, but I also have a couple of corrections
     to make to the entry checklist. They aren't corrections, 
     they just are pieces of the entry
     checklist which will correspond to what I've
     written - already read to you. And I'm ready to
     to on that whenever you are. And Vance tells me
     you can get into the descent water for drinking
     now.

[459342]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23
CMP: We can get into the descent water for drinking,
     huh?

[459345]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23
CC:  Yes.

[459347]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23
CMP: Sounds good.

[459348]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23

[459354]
_page : 660
_tape : 85/23

     will be good until LM jettison?

[459379]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CC: Okay, Jack. Looks like we're going to go on
     the ascent tanks and 128:30. And it looks like - -

[459389]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CMP: Okay, understand. We are going - -

[459390]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CC:  - - you have plenty of water. I'm sorry we cut
     each other out; say again.

[459394]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CMP: Okay, yes. I was going to say, understand we're
     going to go on the ascent tanks at 128:30.

[459400]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CC:  That's right; based on the current rate, that's
     what they predict and you can go ahead and drink
     the water. No sweat.

[459408]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CMP: Okay, real fine. And I've got the entry checklist 
     out and I'm ready to copy; just give me the
     page.

[459414]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CC:  Okay. Jack, you're starting to sound like an LMP.

[459424]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CMP: I think I'm probably the only CMP that's ever
     witnessed an - a LM burn from inside the LM in - in space flight.

[459434]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CC:  (Laughter) I hope it stays that way. Okay,
     Jack, we're starting on page 1-1.

[459441]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CMP: Go ahead.

[459443]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CC:  Okay, down in the middle of the page on line 9,
     we're just going to strike out the "Activate VHF
     for COMM checks," and line 10, "Verify the DSE."
     We're going to leave the DSE OFF, and that's to
     save power, as is the VHF activation.

[459462]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CMP: Okay.

[459465]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CC:  Okay, on page 1-2. At minus 2 hours, there's a
     title "Logic sequence" check; and we're deleting
     that entire sequence; that's included in what I
     read up to you.

[459483]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CMP: Okay, delete the logic sequence check at
     minus 2 hours there.

[459489]
_page : 661
_tape : 85/24
CC:  That's correct. And delete lines 23, 24, and
     25. That means a maneuver to SUPERCIRC entry
     attitude. Everything below that is deleted.

[459513]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CC:  Okay. Delete lines 23 through 28.

[459518]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CC:  That's correct. You got ahead of me. All right,
     on line 29 on page 1-3, we're going to put in a
     time of minus 00:55. That's the time we gave
     you for the boresight check.

[459535]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CMP: Okay - -

[459536]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CC:  That's your sextant check, really.

[459545]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CMP: Got that.

[459546]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CC:  Okay, on the top of page 1-4; where it said
     "1 hour and 15 minutes" next to line 32, we're
     going to change that to "Minus 2 hours and
     30 minutes."

[459562]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CMP: Okay, minus 02:30 opposite item 32.

[459565]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CC:  Okay, down at the bottom of the EMS entry check
     right there where we are, the bottom line now
     reads, "EMS MODE to STANDBY." Well, just above
     that - like to remind you to put a remark, "Do
     not initialize the range to go." This is because
     you're going to come into the EMS entry check,
     you're going to run through all these things;
     then we're going to remove power from the EMS.
     And just didn't want you to get ahead of yourself
     and initialize the entry parameters, because
     you'll lose them when we power up.

[459599]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CMP: Okay.

[459600]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CC:  And, after we go EMS MODE to STANDBY, like for
     you to add "Circuit breaker EMS, two, to open."

[459619]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CMP: Okay, "CB EMS, two, to open."

[459621]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CC:  That's correct. And we want to delete this "Set
     up camera" that's listed on the bottom of the
     page. We're deleting that for power reasons.
     That's line 33 Alfa.

[459634]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CMP: Okay, we're way ahead of you. We already got it
     stowed.

[459639]
_page : 662
_tape : 85/25
CC:  Okay. On the top of the next page where it says
     "Secondary water EVAP," just keep in mind we
     don't plan to use the secondary evaporators unless 
     the primary fails. On line 35 on page 1-5,
     next to "COmmand module RCS preheat," the time
     is not "Minus 06:30."

[459674]
_page : 663
_tape : 85/26
CMP: Okay, "minus 06:30," and the voltage reading 3.9
     still is good, right?

[459681]
_page : 663
_tape : 85/26
CC:  Okay, very good. Under "Final stowage," the
     first thing that's listed on line 36, page 1-5,
     is "Optics." And if you want to get started on
     your stowage, we'd like to leave the optics out,
     because we'll have the star check coming up quite
     a bit after this. The rest of that stuff can be
     taken care of at your convenience.

[459707]
_page : 663
_tape : 85/26
CMP: Okay.

[459708]
_page : 663
_tape : 85/26
CC:  All right, still on pace 1-5, line 37; the time
     is now "Minus 06:10."

[459723]
_page : 663
_tape : 85/26
CMP: Got that.

[459725]
_page : 663
_tape : 85/26
CC:  Okay, and this is one time it looks like we
     might actually do the preheat, so that's the
     reason we want to make sure that we know that
     not more than 20 minutes of time on the preheat.
     We may not be able to watch it at that time
     because you aren't powered up.

[459754]
_page : 663
_tape : 85/26
CMP: Okay. Either 20 minutes or until 3.9 volts DC.

[459758]
_page : 663
_tape : 85/26
CC:  That's correct, Jack. And now let's go to
     page 1-6. And about one-third of the way down,
     it shows "Panel 275 CB MAIN A, BAT C, closed,"
     we want to strike off that line, the next two
     lines, and we're going to strike out "MAIN A,
     BAT C, closed; MAIN B, BAT C, closed; and DC
     INDICATOR, MAIN B."

[459791]
_page : 663
_tape : 85/26
CMP: Okay. After that step on panel 275, strike out
     "CB MAIN A, BAT C; CB MAIN B, BAT C; and DC
     INDICATORS to MAIN B."

[459802]
_page : 663
_tape : 85/26
CC:  That's correct. Now reader panel 8, it tells you
     to "Close all circuit breakers EXCEPT," and I
     have four additions. The first one is CB SERVICE
     MODULE RCS HEATERS, QUAD Charlie, MAIN B, open.

[459830]
_page : 663
_tape : 85/26
CMP: SERVICE MODULE RCS HEATERS, QUAD Charlie, MAIN
     Baker, open.

[459835]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CC: Okay. And the same thing for SERVICE MODULE RCS
     HEADERS, QUAD Delta, MAIN A, open.

[459851]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CMP: SERVICE MODULE RCS HEATERS, QUAD Delta, MAIN A,
     open.

[459855]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CC:  That's correct. And Circuit breaker EMS, that's
     two of them, open.

[459905]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CMP: Okay, BAT's at volts and amps.

[459909]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CC:  That's affirmed. And let's go back to page 1-6,
     line 41. Let's put in a time "Minus 04:40."

[459920]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CMP: Minus 04:40.

[459922]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CC:  That's correct. On page 2-1, line number 2, put
     in a time of "Minus 55 minutes."

[459944]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CMP: Okay, minus 55 minutes.

[459947]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CC:  Okay. And the first thing you want to do under
     "EMS initialization," is circuit breakers EMS,
     that's two of them, to close.

[459961]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CMP: Okay. CB EMS, two, to close.

[459964]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CC:  That's correct. All right. Line 4 or step 4,
     where it shows "CM RCS check." That occurs at
     minus 04:30.

[459977]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CMP: Okay. Minus 04:30.

[459980]
_page : 664
_tape : 85/27
CC:  All right. Under "CM RCS checks," the fourth
     line down says "MANUAL ATTITUDE, three, to MINIMUM 
     IMPULSE." We'll have to use "ACCEL COMMAND"
     and the reason for that, Jack, is we don't have
     the SPS powered up so there's no minimum impulse
     generator.

[459999]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CMP: Okay. MANUAL ATTITUDE, three, to ACCEL COMMAND.

[460002]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CC:  That's correct. And on the same page 2-1, strike
     out the last three lines, starting with "RCS
     transfer to service module."

[460017]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CMP: Right. The last three lines are scratched out.
     We ain't got one of those things.

[460022]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CC:  That's correct. Okay, let's flip to page 2-2
     and strike out the first two lines.

[460031]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CMP: Okay. Now wait a second. I need to give you
     volts and amps, Ken.

[460034]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CC: All right. Go ahead.

[460039]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CMP: Okay. It's 39.6, 1.12.

[460045]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CC:  Sounds like you're getting there. Okay. I
     believe we scratched out the first two lines on
     2-2. Now, we're - right below that, it says
     "Separation checklist." So we're going to just
     delete that whole thing; it's included in the
     notes I gave you.

[460070]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CMP: Okay. It's included in the notations.

[460075]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CC:  All right. Line number 7. It says "Maneuver to
     horizon check attitude." We're going to call
     this the "Moon-check attitude" and this is the
     one we discussed, Jack. The angle of 265 is not
     correct. I'll have one of those for you first
     thing in the morning.

[460095]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CMP: Okay.

[460096]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CC:  Okay. And at the bottom of the page, step
     number 1. That will be at EI minus 19 minutes,
     and we're off and running through a normal
     sequence of events.

[460112]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
CMP: Okay. That sounds good. Ken, I guess if you've
     read this thing - Is it a comfortable time line?
     Any areas where you had problems with?

[460122]
_page : 665
_tape : 85/28
_extra : 
CC:  Jack, it is very comfortable. We've run it
     several times now and, in fact, it's being run
     right now, again. And we've run it both here
     at Houston and at the Cape. The only place where
     you might find that you need to stay ahead of
     things is during the platform-alinement period,
     when you're getting ready to close out the LM
     and then once you get into the command module and
     jettison the LM, why you're back on a very comfortable time. And, of course, we'll be watching
     and anything we can do, like keeping track of
     time for you, we'll remind you of that as we go
     along.

[460156]
_page : 666
_tape : Tape 85/29
CMP: Hey, that would be good - that would be good,
     Ken.

[460162]
_page : 666
_tape : Tape 85/29
CC:  Okay. Let me emphasize, Jack, that 2-1/2 hours
     is the earliest time we can start in on that
     powerup stuff. Everything else you can do the
     way you normally would, where you get as far
     ahead of the game as you can. But the 2-1/2-hour time is based on saving command module consumables. And if you do that, why we're fat;
     we've got plenty of time to give you some fans
     on the water even. So that's the one point you
     don't want to start early on. I do have a
     couple of more lines to run through on the entry
     checklist and two pages in the G&C. And I think
     that will clean us up.

[460214]
_page : 666
_tape : Tape 85/29
CMP: Okay, Ken. And G&C checklist now?

[460217]
_page : 666
_tape : Tape 85/29
CC:  Let me finish a couple more things in the entry
     book. You still got that?

[460223]
_page : 666
_tape : Tape 85/29
CMP: Yes. Go ahead.

[460224]
_page : 666
_tape : Tape 85/29
CC:  Okay. On - These are just cleanup items, Jack.
     On page 2-3, it lists now you separate, from the
     CM/SM SEP and all that, so, obviously, if we're
     on step 5 at 43 minutes down - that's all deleted.
     And that gets deleted all the way over onto
     page 2-4, up to the line where it says "15 minutes.'' And at that point, we pick back up and
     everything. From 15 minutes down is valid.

[460267]
_page : 666
_tape : Tape 85/29
CMP: Okay. Delete item 5 down to the point where it
     says "Minus 15 minutes."

[460274]
_page : 666
_tape : Tape 85/29
_extra : 
CC:  That's correct, Jack. Okay, on page 2-5. The
     top line where we had "Horizon check," that's
     now the "Moonset check" and the time is approximately 57:37. And that's minus 02:23. And that
     angle that's listed in the book there - 177 -
     that's really a horizon time at 2 minutes; we'll
     have you - can look that up on the back of your
     entry cue card, and I'll look that number up
     again for you tonight.

[460320]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
CMP: Okay.

[460321]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
CC:  Okay. Another thing is to remember when we begin
     blackout, which is around 05g, and you can write
     this in your checklist wherever it's convenient;
     once we've lost COMM, we're going to go ahead and
     power down the SCE POWER OFF and the PMP POWER
     OFF. And we just want to do that after you lose
     COMM, which comes up around EI. Any time after
     that, go ahead and secure the PMP and the SCE
     power.

[460362]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
CMP: Okay. When COMM is lost, SCE POWER OFF, PMP
     POWER OFF.

[460367]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
CC:  That's correct, Jack, and that completes the
     entry checklist. Let's look at the G&C book.

[460386]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
CMP: Okay. Ready to copy.

[460388]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
CC:  Okay. Let's go to page 2-1.

[460405]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[460407]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
CC:  Okay, Jack. The second line under "IMU powerup"
     says "FDAI POWER to BOTH," and we're going to
     make that a "1." The reason we're doing that
     is, again, to conserve power. There's no reason
     to drive the second FDAI before we get that
     information to put on it.

[460428]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
CMP: Okay. "FDAI POWER to 1."

[460433]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
CC:  All right. That's correct. On page 2-2.

[460446]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
CMP: Go ahead.

[460447]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
_extra : 
CC:  Okay. Under CMC powerup, line - or step 2 says
     "Flashing 3700, ENTER." The time we're going to
     use this, Jack, is going to be when you've just
     brought the computer up and it has a state vector
     in it that's way back many, many hours ago. So
     we want to do a VERB 96, ENTER to stop the integration to keep it from just sitting there
     ambling along. And when the ground gives you a
     new state vector, why then we can go through P00
     and we'll be back in business.

[460483]
_page : 668
_tape : Tape 85/31
CMP: Okay. You want me to go to VERB 37, ENTER; 00,
     ENTER; and then do a VERB 96?

[460495]
_page : 668
_tape : Tape 85/31
CC: When you come up, I guess you're going to - once
     you get the CMC powered up, you're probably going
     to be going - you're going to come up in a flashing 37, and if you'll just do a VERB 96, ENTER
     right there, that will take care of it.

[460508]
_page : 668
_tape : Tape 85/31
CMP: Okay.

[460509]
_page : 668
_tape : Tape 85/31
CC:  All right. And the last one I have for you is
     on page 2-4.

[460523]
_page : 668
_tape : Tape 85/31
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[460524]
_page : 668
_tape : Tape 85/31
CC:  Okay. Under the SCS powerup, the first line
     says "AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, to OFF." Okay. You
     can just delete that part. On the fifth line,
     it says "Circuit breaker SCS LOGIC POWER," that's
     really "LOGIC BUS, four of them, to closed."
     The DELTA-V CG is not important since we are not
     burning the engine. The "SIGNAL CONDITIONER/
     DRIVER BIAS POWER" lists "Two to AC 1." We are
     going to make that just one of them; make it
     "SIGNAL CONDITION/DRIVER BIAS POWER, one, to
     AC 1." The "BMAG POWER," which is the third
     line from the bottom, says "BMAG POWER, two, ON;"
     we are going to make that just one. We'll bring
     up number 1, and we'll make "FDAI POWER, number 1" and the last line "AUTO RCS SELECT, 16,
     enable," you can strike that off and replace it
     with "BMAG MODE, three of them, to RATE 1." You
     want to try reading that back?

[460618]
_page : 668
_tape : Tape 85/31
CMP: Okay. Delete "AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, OFF." Change
     "CB LOGIC POWER" to "LOGIC THRUST POWER - CBS
     CS LOGIC THRUST, four, to closed." Delete
     "DELTA-V CG," coming down here "SIGNAL
     CONDITIONER/DRIVER BIAS POWER, one, AC 1; BMAG
     POWER, 1, to ON," and it's the number 1 BMAG.
     "FDAI POWER to 1; BMAG MODE, three, to RATE 1,"
     deleting the "AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, to enable."

[460654]

     I can tell you something about that. And I do
     have an answer to your LM power question about
     the umbilicals. The umbilicals will be unpowered

_tape : Tape 85/32
CC:  Okay, Jack. It looks like we've closed up the
     loose ends here. Amazingly enough, out of all
     that stuff, it looks like we only generated one
     question on the floor, and we'll research that
     one. We'll even let you guess what it might
     have been. If you have any questions, after you
     mull it over, why, we're always available. Just

[465589]
_page : 691

CC: Okay. This will be JETS for RCS and THROTTLE
     for DPS.

[465600]
_page : 691
_tape : Tape 86/21
LMP: What I don't understand is, what is this MCC
     likely to be? I thought it was going to be an RCS.

[466099]
_page : 693
_tape : Tape 86/23
CC: Okay, Fred. Just two changes, comments to what
     we just gave you. The first is near the front
     at EI - in the section under "EI minus 2-1/2 hours,"
     power removal from CM LM umbilical." We'll let
     you turn to that.

[466124]
_page : 693
_tape : Tape 86/23
LMP: Okay, I'm there at "EI minus 2-1/2 hours, power
     removal CM LM umbilical."

[466129]
_page : 693
_tape : Tape 86/23
CC: Okay. Under LM, we have a step, BAT 2, LOW
     VOLTAGE, 0FF/RESET, than ON. Next we have a
     step BAT 2, HI VOLTAGE. OFF/RESET, then ON. We
     request that you wait in between these two steps
     for us to give you a GO. In other words, we'd
     like to look and see that all the relays closed
     and all that sort of thing before you throw BAT 2,
     HI VOLTACE, to OFF/RESET, and ON.

[466173]
_page : 693
_tape : Tape 86/23
LMP: Okay, After BAT 2, LOW VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET, I'll -
     then ON, I'll wait for a MSFN GO before proceeding.

[466182]
_page : 693
_tape : Tape 86/23
CC: Right-o. Okay. Next, at - Under the section of
     "EI minus 1 hour and 45 minutes" - No, change
     that. Correction, "EI minus 1 hour, 35 minutes,"
     refer to the ECS section, and we have a change.

[466213]
_page : 693
_tape : Tape 86/23
LMP: All right. Go ahead, Vance.

[466217]
_page : 693
_tape : Tape 86/23
CC:  Okay, Jim's right. We should cross out all this
     stuff with a couple of exceptions. FORWARD DUMP
     valve, closed, the first step, should remain.
     Ail other steps should be scratched, except for
     the last one, which is OVERHEAD DUMP valve, closed.
     That leaves two steps.

[466245]
_page : 693
_tape : Tape 86/23
LMP: Okay. Under ECS, we delete all except the first
     step, FORWARD DUMP valeve, close, and step 10,
     which is OVERHEAD DUMP valve, closed, and leave
     in verify transfer list.

[466266]
_page : 693
_tape : Tape 86/23
CC: That's affirm. Leave in what follows, which is
     verify transfer list and IVT and all that.

[466288]
_page : 693
_tape : Tape 86/23
CC: IVT, of course, meaning CDR transferring to the CM.

     quite as extensive as the CSM had, but still pretty
     long. Any comments or questions to the house
     here ?

LMP: No, it looks pretty good to me, Vance.

_page : 694
_tape : Tape 86/24
CC: Okay, Fred. We're going to try to refrain from
     calling you from now on, so that you can maybe
     get a couple of winks. We're getting a status

[477240]
_page : 697
_tape : Tape 88/2
CC: Okay, Jack. The time line between EI minus 02:30
     and 1 hour is real crowded, so you're really
     going to have to hustle, and we've decided to
     delete the EMS entry check at minus 02:30. That'll
     give you a little more time in there. What we've
     decided to do with it is wait until after EI minus 1,
     just before you initialize the EMS. If you have
     time, and only if you have time, do the EMS entry
     check. Otherwise, forget it and go right on into
     EMS initialization. You understand?

[477289]
_page : 697
_tape : Tape 88/2
CMP: Okay. You're going to delete between 2 hours and
     30 minutes and 02:15 there, and you're going to
     add it, if there is time, only if there is time,
     at EI minus 1 hour where the EMS initialization
     occurs .

[477311]
_page : 697
_tape : Tape 88/2
CC:  That's right. You got it correctly. Okay, Jack.
     One other item. Just before EI minus 2 hours

     VERB 74 ENTER. Over.

_extra : END OF TAPE
CMP: Hey, Jack, that's in work. And one thing,
     comparing Jim's checklist with my own, I find
     one difference there at EI minus 02:30. His
     checklist has me changing a - opening a EPS
     SENSOR SIGNAL circuit breaker right prior to
     turning off LM power. Is - I'd like to find out
     which checklist is correct.

[477665]
_page : 699
_tape : Tape 89/1
CC:  Hey, Jack. The LM checklist is just for information to Jim.
     It's just to tell him that - that
     you're changing back to command module power.
     Your checklist is correct. Over.

[477680]
_page : 699
_tape : Tape 89/1
CMP: Okay. And when do you figure that you'll be
     sending up the pads that you have?

[477842]
_page : 699
_tape : Tape 89/1
CC:  Aquarius, all of your pads will be coming up in
     about 3-1/2 hours, at EI minus 06:30. And one
     thing we want to remind you of, when you remove
     power from the command module LM umbilical, is
     to be sure that you open the LM POWER MAIN B
     circuit breakers, both of them, before you start
     throwing switches and circuit breakers in the
     LM. Do it as we've outlined it in the procedure,
     in that order. Over.

[477873]
_page : 699
_tape : Tape 89/1
LMP: Okay. That's the way we planned on it. We'll
     let Jack do his three and then he'll tell us
     when we're GO from there. What pages are those
     changes on?

[477888]
_page : 699
_tape : Tape 89/1
CC:  Okay, Fred. The one I've got for you is at the
     end of power removal from the command module LM
     umbilical. And just for your information, after
     you go through that entire procedure and about
     the time you're ready to transfer to the command
     module, at that time, power will be removed from
     the umbilical, and it's okay to disconnect it.
     That is, after you've thrown the switches in the
     LM. Is that clear?

[477921]
_page : 699
_tape : Tape 89/1
LMP: Roger. That's where I've got a remark here to
     check with you to see if it's all right to proceed.

[477928]
_page : 699
_tape : Tape 89/1
CC:  Roger. And that would be just after, on panel 16,
     you opening ASCENT ECA CONTROL breakers.

[477942]
_page : 699
_tape : Tape 89/1
LMP: Which step number is that?

[477963]
_page : 699
_tape : Tape 89/1
LMP: The confusing thing is, Jack, where they told
     me to wait for MSFN GC before proceeding was
     that BAT 2 LOW VOLTS OFF/RESET, then ON.

[477972]
_page : 699
_tape : Tape 89/1
CC:  Okay. That's still affirmative. We'll give you
     a go after waiting 5 seconds, and then down from
     there just a few steps, after you have opened
     the ASCENT ECA CONTROL breakers on panel 16, at that point, the
     umbilical is now powered, and it's okay to disconnect them should
     you care to do so.

[477995]
_page : 700
_tape : Tape 89/2
LMP: Okay. After the last step then, I'm free to
     disconnect.

[477999]
_page : 700
_tape : Tape 89/2
CC:  Right. And one other change we have is, shortly
     after that, where we're configuring for jettison,
     we have closed both the FORWARD DUMP valve and
     the OVERHEAD DUMP valve. And we don't want to
     get in a locked up position like that, so one
     way to get around it is to - After we close the
     FORWARD DUMP valve, turn the DESCENT OXYGEN valve
     off. Over.

[478037]
_page : 700
_tape : Tape 89/2
LMP: Okay. After the FORWARD DUMP valve, add a step
     in that says the DESCENT OX valve, off.

[478051]
_page : 700
_tape : Tape 89/2
CC:  Okay, Fred. That concludes the DELTAs. And
     perhaps you heard that our GAMMAs are still
     minus 6.03 and our DELTA-V will be a 2.8-foot-per-second RCS burn.

[478066]
_page : 700
_tape : Tape 89/2
LMP: Roger.

[478103]
_page : 700
_tape : Tape 89/2
CC:  Fred-o, we've got one more change we'd like to
     give you to clarify a question that Jack asked
     earlier. At EI minus 02'30 - -

[478115]
_page : 700
_tape : Tape 89/2

CC: At E mi - EI minus 02:30, during power removal
     from the umbilical, first thing we do is two
     steps with the CSM. We open the MAIN B, the LM
     POWER to MAIN B circuit breakers, and then there's
     a third step which says "Circuit breaker EPS
     SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open." Just delete that
     step. Over.

_tape : Tape 89/3
CDR: Okay, Jack. This is Jim. I just want to make
     sure that you're filtering the changes to the
     checklist that come up to make sure that they're
     absolutely essential. When we learn our procedures, we can only do it one time, and we can't
     make changes at the last minute. We'd like to
     do the best, the safest way possible, but unless
     the changes are really essential, don't bother
     sending them up.

[478317]
_page : 701
_tape : Tape 89/3
CC:  Roger. We won't. The chairman of the CPCB is
     still active, and one thing we're trying to do
     is to save you all the time we can between EI
     minus 02:30 and 1 hour.

[478330]
_page : 701
_tape : Tape 89/3
CDR: That's affirm. That's a real important time.

[478334]
_page : 701
_tape : Tape 89/3
F: Yes. For your information, Jim, I don't know
     whether you heard that originally, but that
     time from 2-1/2 to 1 in there has been run
     about three times, and it's pretty tight, so
     we've tried to weed out what we could, which
     isn't much, but I think the other message you
     might impress on Jack when you get around to
     alining that platform, don't try to get it
     down too neat. It doesn't have to be all
     that good. Just do a nice quick and dirty
     one, and that's going to be good enough anyway.

[478363]
_page : 701
_tape : Tape 89/3
CDR: I concur. I think for reentry we don't have
     to have a real accurate platform, but I haven't
     told Jack that.

[478370]
_page : 701
_tape : Tape 89/3
F: Roger. Hey, Jim, while you're up and things
     are nice and quiet, let me give you a couple of
     other things to think about. One specifically.
     I know none of you are sleeping worth a damn
     because it's so cold, and you might want to
     dig out the medical kit there around 01:35 or
     in that ballpark, and pull out a couple of
     Dexedrines apiece and try one about then, and
     another around 01:39 to 01:40.

[478395]
_page : 702
_tape : Tape 89/4
CDR: Well, I hadn't brought that up. We might -
     We might consider it.

[478397]
_page : 702
_tape : Tape 89/4
F: Okay.

[478419]
_page : 702
_tape : Tape 89/4
F: Wish we could figure a way to get a hot cup of
     coffee up to you. It'd probably taste pretty
     good about now, wouldn't it?

[478426]
_page : 702
_tape : Tape 89/4
CDR: Yes, it sure Would. You don't realize how cold
     this thing becomes when it's in a PTC mode that's
     slowing down, and I just clocked the cycles on
     my ... And it's about 11 to 12 minutes now, and
     the Sun is directly overhead, so it's shining on
     the engine bell of the service module and not
     getting down to the spacecraft at all.

[478456]
_page : 702
_tape : Tape 89/4
F: Hang in there. It won't be long now.

[478459]
_page : 702
_tape : Tape 89/4
CDR: Yes. That's right. As a matter of fact, doing
     this alignment on the Earth this time will be
     like making a landing with a fogged-up windshield.

CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[480128]
_page : 702
_tape : Tape 89/4
CC:  Okay, Skipper. We figured out a way for you to
     keep warm. We decided to start powering you up
     now, and what we want you to do - what we want
     you to do is take your entry LM PREP checklist
     and start at the top where it says "BAT 5 NORMAL
     FEED on," and then jump over as it says to your
     30-minute activation, and do all of the 30-minute
     activation up to, but not including, the burn.
     You copy?

[480172]
_page : 702
_tape : Tape 89/4
CDR: Okay. If I understand you correctly, then that
     gives me leeway to mareuver when we get up to
     activation complete, and we can be in position
     for the burn, but we will not burn. We don't
     have a pad anyway.

[480195]
_page : 702
_tape : Tape 89/4
CC:  That's affirm, Jim. You could maneuver to burn
     attitude, or you could maneuver to an attitude
     which should put the Sun in the windows to warm
     the place up.

[480203]
_page : 702
_tape : Tape 89/4
CDR: Sounds good, and you're sure we have plenty of
     electrical power to do this?

[480209]
_page : 703
_tape : Tape 89/5

     to do it. I can get you a number, though.

     up in a hurry in there is when you get your AC
     on to turn on the window heaters.

[480958]
_page : 704
_tape : Tape 89/6
LMP: Okay. I guess the only question I have is what
     it's liable to do to us with the - looks like
     almost a frost on it now.

_page : 704
_tape : Tape 89/6

_page : 705
_tape : Tape 89/7
LMP: And, Jack, I guess we haven't changed our angle
     much with respect to the Sun 93 million miles
     away, so it ought to be in about the same place
     in the AOT, isn't that Charlie?

     for P52s, the command module docking
     probe is right down the middle of - the docking
     light, rather, is right down the middle of the

     get a check on the Moon, again, to see if those

     We had the Moon centered, and it's pretty close
     to what we have on the 8 ball, I guess. Close
     enough for any entry that we'd like to do.

[486620]

_tape : Tape 90/6
CC: Roger. We'll pass the word.

[488301]
_page : 712
_tape : Tape 90/6
CC: Aquarius, Houston. We think we've figured out
     a way to save you some time at a very critical --
     very full schedule. And that's by doing a
     docked coarse aline, since we got the LM up now.
     That would save you a maneuver or two.

[488378]
_page : 712
_tape : Tape 90/6
CDR: Houston, Aquarius. It seemed to me a docked
     coarse aline might be quicker for - for Jack.

[488385]
_page : 712
_tape : Tape 90/6
CC:  Yes. We think it would be, and it'd save quite
     a bit of time at a place where you're going to
     be pretty busy. Also save you some petrol.

[488396]
_page : 712
_tape : Tape 90/6
CMP: Affirm.

[488413]
_page : 712
_tape : Tape 90/6
CC:  Okay, Jim. We're looking at doing this in the
     service module SEP attitude, and the optics will
     be pointed away from the Sun. So it should be a
     good attitude for a P52.

[488434]
_page : 712
_tape : Tape 90/6
CDR: Okay. So, we'll be going to the service module
     SEP attitude, at which time we'll do a docked
     coarse aline, and -

[488454]
_page : 712
_tape : Tape 90/6
CDR: Then you want - You want Jack then to do a P527

[488480]
_page : 712
_tape : Tape 90/6
CC:  The way we'll do that in our time line Jim, is
     to go ahead and do the service module JETT and
     then we'll just stay in that attitude and when
     it comes time in our time line as we've outlined,
     to bring the platform up, we'll proceed with the
     P52 - coarse aline, and then the P52.

[488500]
_page : 712
_tape : Tape 90/6
CDR: Okay. Are we going to use the same techniques
     that we normally do for LM activation? In other
     words, I try to maintain an attitude, smd give
     him some angles and then - Are you going to give
     him the angles? Then he does the 52.

[488517]
_page : 712
_tape : Tape 90/6
CC:  Basically, it's the same procedure just reversed,
     Jim.

[488521]

_tape : Tape 90/6
CDR: Okay.

[488522]
_page : 712

     done before.

[488560]

     you talk over with me what your plans are?

[488750]
_page : 714
_tape : Tape 91/1
CC:  Roger, Jack. Since we've got the PGNS up, we
     plan to use that information to give the CMC a
     dock coarse alone, and then we're in the service
     module jettison attitude, we'll wait until it
     comes time to power up the CMC, and we'll get
     the CMC a dock coarse aline, and we'll pick some
     good stars to give you a fine aline with, and it
     looks like we can pick some stars that are looking
     away from the Sun in which you can find in that
     service module jettison attitude; so, we'll save
     you quite a bit of gas: and save you some time
     in a very busy time.

[488925]
_page : 714
_tape : Tape 91/1

     procedure where we do the dock coarse aline.

[488945]
_page : 714
_tape : Tape 91/1
CMP: Yes, except in a way we did a lot of VERB 06

[488963]
_page : 715
_tape : Tape 91/2

     of VERB 06 NOUN 20, ENTERS simultaneously, reading
     you out the difference in the angles, and then
     MSFN furnishes the post-torquing angles, in
     order to get the platform fine alined. Do you
     plan something like that or Just three coarse
     aline angles.

[488993]
_page : 715
_tape : Tape 91/2
CC:  Jack, we're going to give you three coarse aline

     The following MCC-7, maneuver the LM to the

     LM SEP pad. It appears to me that in my configuration, I could probably use a VERB 49 loading in
     622, yaw, pitch, and roll, in that order; and then
     being able to fly out at 5018 in roll, pitch, and
     yaw. Is that correct?

[490777]

     or - I can't read it. Comes down just about the -
     oh, about the 20th one down, after panel 276,
     where it says CB INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL 3

     give that to me again?

     a VERB 49 maneuver to the LM jettison attitude
     because those are FDAI angles we gave you, they
     don't correspond to the gimbal angles for the

[493497]
_page : 720
_tape : Tape 91/7
LMP: Roger, Joe. Figured, if we're going to do this
     burn in PGNS now, I ought to give you an update
     on the contingency book pages 32, 33, and 34, because the last time we went through this portion,
     we were burning it in ACS.

[493522]
_page : 721
_tape : Tape 91/8
CC: Okay, Fred. Stand by. We've been talking about possibly having you do it in
     ACS. We recommend at this time that you fo an ACS to PGNS aline, the 400 plus 3 procedure only. Over.

[493544]
_page : 721
_tape : Tape 91/8
LMP: Okay.

[493579]

_tape : Tape 91/8
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[493584]
_page : 721
_tape : Tape 91/8
CC:  Roger. We recommend that you perform this burn
     in AGS, as you did the last midcourse manuever;
     we think it will save gas. Over.

[493596]
_page : 721
_tape : Tape 91/8
CDR: Okay. Joe, do you want me to line up the same
     way we did the last one, too?

[493602]
_page : 721
_tape : Tape 91/8
CC:  Stand by on that.

[493617]
_page : 721
_tape : Tape 91/8
LMP: And, Joe, Jack just handed me some injector 
     temperatures, if you want to read these on ... so I can
     plug them in.

[493625]

[493641]

[493751]
_page : 721
_tape : Tape 91/8
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[493753]
_page : 721
_tape : Tape 91/8
CC:  Okay, Jim. Our recommendation on this burn is that
     you maneuver to the bucn attitude, in PGNS MIN
     IMPULSE, then do a body-axis aline, 400 plus 5,
     followed by 400 plus 0, and then do the burn in
     AGS. Over.

[493774]
_page : 721
_tape : Tape 91/8
CDR: Okay. Now we're spinning it with the PGNS, what
     you gave us for a PGNS attitude. Is this the wrong
     one? Do you want me to just to aline up the Earth
     as I did before in the last midcourse?

[493786]
_page : 721
_tape : Tape 91/8
CC:  No. We don't want you to do that. Read me your
     FDAI angles, and let's compare them with what
     we have down here.

[493795]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CDR: Okay. You're looking at them in the DSKY. I've
     got roll of 8.47; pitch of about 0.51; and yaw
     looking at about 3.750.

[493818]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CC:  Okay, Jim. Those are very close - I guess all you
     need to do is trim them up a bit.

[493826]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CDR: I plan to do a final trim - AUTO trim, and then
     a four-jet translation.

[493840]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CC:  Okay, Jim. For fuel conservation, we'd prefer
     you to trim it up MIN IMPULSE, and there's really
     very little trim required; and then go ahead and
     do it AGS. We're on the expected fuel usage, but
     we're just being old ladies about it.

[493858]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CDR: Okay. Understand. My only question, Joe, is the
     fact that both the roll and the yaw needles did
     not go to null when I did an AUTO maneuver. I'd
     tried to go manually to the attitude; and then
     went to AUTO, but the roll and the yaw do not
     come in at all.

[493874]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CC:  Roger. I haven't got an answer on that yet, but
     your attitude looks very close.

[493880]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CDR: Okay. I can take it on ...

[493965]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CDR: And, Houston, Aquarius. I'm not sure that if I
     follow and null the needles, that will be the
     proper attitude.

[493982]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CC:  Okay. Stand by 1, Jim. We're talking about it.
     It's going to be very close; in any event, close
     enough.

[493990]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CDR: Okay.

[493996]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CC:  And, Jim, just for your information, I have the
     entry pad. I have the landing area weather
     summary, which you probably don't even have to
     copy, but which I'll read up to you when you're
     ready; and some stars for Jack that I'm holding
     for him for later on.

[494011]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CDR: Okay.

[494022]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
LMP: And, Joe, Jack says all the injector temperatures,
     he just checked them again, and they're all over
     3.9 - -

[494030]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
CC:  That they're all over 3.9 now. Thanks a lot.

[494038]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
CC:  You can tell him that it's looking good to us.
     They were even happy with the previous ones.

[494045]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
LMP: Okay.

[494102]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
CDR: And, my only question, Houston, is do you want me
     to null the PGNS needle manually?

[494108]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
CC:  Okay. Stand by 1 more minute, Jim.

[494207]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[494209]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[494211]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
LMP: Yes. I guess the basic question is comparing the
     balls here and out the window it doesn't look
     too unreasonable, and I guess Jim says the COAS
     is yawed and roll slightly off from what he might
     eyeball; but yet, the FDAI air needles for PGNS
     are showing a full scale left in roll and full
     scale left in yaw. ...

[494237]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
CC:  Okay. Go ahead.

[494243]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
LMP: Yes. It appears if we track those we, obviously,
     aren't going to be on the attitude that we burned
     the last midcourse.

[494250]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
CC:  Okay. Well, this attitude we passed you is not
     quite alined to the terminator, and stand by on
     this.

[494259]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
CC:  It should be off about 8 degrees, FLIGHT.
     END OF TAPE

[494437]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1
CC:  Oh, we're getting there, Jim. We're - we're all
     agreed that you're almost, but not quite, in the
     proper attitude, and we're just trying to get
     you one firm recommendation on how to proceed
     from here.

[494448]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1
CDR: Okay. I have nulled the null - roll needle and
     the pitch needle now and I'm yawed - rolled left
     now. I'm rolled left about 9 degrees.

[494459]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1
CC:  Okay. Understand the needles are nulled.

[494463]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1

[494467]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1
CC:  Roger that.

[494630]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[494632]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1
CDR: Go ahead.

[494633]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1
CC:  Okay. Here's the big story. Your attitude
     really looks quite good except in roll, and we'd
     like you to do the following. In MIN impulse
     PGNS, we'd like you to trim to zero pitch, which
     is about where you are now; to 008 degrees in
     roll, which is about 16 degrees from your present roll attitude; and to zero degrees in yaw,
     which is about where you are now. Then we'd
     like you to do the body-axis aline 400 plus 5,
     400 plus 0. PITCH and ROLL to PULSE, select
     AGS, do the burn in AGS. How does that sound?
     Over.

[494673]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1
CDR: Okay. I'm rolled the wrong way; that is what
     you're saying, right?

[494677]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1
CC:  That's right.

[494689]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1

     I've got to use TTCAs.

[494696]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1
CC:  That's right, Jim. Sorry.

[494786]
_page : 724
_tape : Tape 92/1
CDR: And you don't want me to automatically trim 5018,
     I take it.

[494802]
_page : 725
_tape : Tape 92/2
CC:  That's affirm, Jim. Don't trim 5018.

[494806]
_page : 725
_tape : Tape 92/2
CDR: Okay.

[494813]
_page : 725
_tape : Tape 92/2

     the average g and burn it out.

[494820]
_page : 725
_tape : Tape 92/2
CDR: Okay.

[494871]

[494874]
_page : 725
_tape : Tape 92/2
CC:  Just for your information, we see 3.0 in register 1. We read you up 3.1 on the pad. The
     actual DELTA-V was 3.05, and they warned me that
     it might come out 3.0.

[494891]
_page : 725
_tape : Tape 92/2

[494893]
_page : 725
_tape : Tape 92/2
CC:  Right.

[494976]
_page : 725
_tape : Tape 92/2
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Your attitude looks real
     good. We will give you a mark at 10 minutes to
     the burn, which is in 28 seconds.

[494986]
_page : 725
_tape : Tape 92/2
CDR: Okay. We'll burn it in AGS and use the AGS ball.

[494994]
_page : 725
_tape : Tape 92/2
CC:  Right. I was looking at the wrong clock, and
     we're a little under 10 minutes now. I'll give
     you a mark at 9 minutes. Okay?

[495005]

[495036]
_page : 725

_page : 726
_tape : Tape 92/3
LMP: Okay. You'd asked - you'd asked me before, Joe,
     to go 400 plus 3, which I did. I assume you've
     changed the script again.

[495488]
_page : 726
_tape : Tape 92/3

     ago, and it doesn't matter; you're looking good.

_page : 726
_tape : Tape 92/3
LMP: Okay.

[495590]
_page : 726

     scattered; visibility, 10; winds 060 at 10;
     wave heights are 4 feet, and the altimeter
     2986, if you care. Scattered showers less
     than 10 percent of the area. Recovery forces
     are as follows: the Iwo Jima will be at the
     touchdown point, the aircraft call sign will
     be Recovery 1, on station with swimmers on
     board. The - we have the constant g backup
     reentry area covered with the USS Hall, the

_page : 738
_tape : Tape 93/1

     the command module to ease the load on MAIN A.
     One of them is to verify or turn the CM/RCS
     HEATER switch to OFF. We're done with that, and
     even though the circuit breakers are pulled, the
     switches might be drawing a little current. And
     the second one is, we'd like him to turn SCS
     LOGIC POWER 2/3 to OFF; we don't need it now.
     It's called up in the checklist at the appropriate time, and we'd like him to turn that off.
     Over.

[500000]
_page : 738
_tape : Tape 93/1
CDR: Okay. I'll tell Jack to check that the CM/RCS
     HEATER switch is off, and, if not, we'll turn
     it off; and also to turn off the SCS LOGIC POWER
     2/3 switch, OFF, since it comes up later in the
     checklist.

[500014]

[500354]
_page : 738
_tape : Tape 93/1

     about 115 instead of about 91. I think Jack can
     use the optics a little bit better at that angle.

[500368]
_page : 738
_tape : Tape 93/1

     good for stars.

[500375]
_page : 739

     look at them a little bit better here.

[500381]
_page : 739
_tape : Tape 93/2
CC:  Okay. With the new attitude, our shaft and trunnion angles we were going to pass him don't mean
     anything, but it's more important to have a good
     star field.

[500985]
_page : 739

[500989]
_page : 739
_tape : Tape 93/2
CC:  Okay, Jim. We - We've been talking about your
     going to a different attitude than the pad attitude for better star field vision out the command
     module, and what we'd like to have you do is this.
     If you can predict now or sometime soon, what
     attitude it is that you would like to hold at
     that time, and go to that attitude now, we'd like
     to be able to compute the coarse aline gimbal
     angles for the CSM, and we can do that if you go
     to the selected attitude, hold it, call up a
     VERB 06 NOUN 20, and read us your LM gimbal angles,
     we can take those and compute CSM coarse aline
     gimbal angles on the assumption that, when we get
     back into the CSM coarse aline, you will return
     to that selected attitude. Does that sound okay?
     Over.

[501046]
_page : 739
_tape : Tape 93/2
CDR: Yes. I'll try to hold the attitude we select
     directly, while you're giving us the coarse aline
     attitude. We're not too sure what - what's the
     best attitude. I'm going to ask Jack again if
     115 is sufficient for him.

[501062]
_page : 739
_tape : Tape 93/2
CC:  Okay. You can take some time figuring out the
     best attitude, and then you won't have to hold
     it all the way from now until then, if you just
     get back to it.

[501178]
_page : 739
_tape : Tape 93/2
CDR: Houston, Jack would like to know what constellations are in his sextant, or scanning telescope,
     field of view at an attitude of about 105 pitch,
     zero roll, zero yaw. Can you give that to us?

[501195]
_page : 739
_tape : Tape 93/2
_extra : 
CC:  Okay. We'll sure give it a go. As I said, we -
     We have some stars. They're not - They're not
     centered with the shaft and trunnion zero. Let
     us take a quick look at 105 pitch, shaft and
     trunnion zero, and see if we can get you an
     answer.

_page : 740
_tape : Tape 93/3
CC: Roger. These - None of these stars will be
     exactly centered, but, at a pitch attitude of
     115, we had computed that Vega, Altair, Rasalhague,
     and Deneb would all be in the telescope field of
     view, and the first three were also in view at
     the 91-degree pitch, so he should be able to see
     one or more of those four stars. Over.

     if - if he's interested.

[501282]
_page : 740
_tape : Tape 93/3
CDR: Okay. Why don't you give us the shaft and trunnion for - say, Altair at 115, and I'll go up

     It looks pretty grim back there right now. It

     ahead and get the coarse aline to the gimbal
     angles that - that you're going to be holding
     for us; and we'll get the platform up, and then
     when you call P52 and you use PICAPAR, it probably won't be close enough to put the star in
     the sextant, but if you can see any kind of a
     bright star in the general vicinity, - and like
     general vicinity, I mean 2 to 3 degrees from the
     center of the telescope, so that you have some
     clue as to which way to go, then the identification problem shouldn't present much of a - of a
     difficulty. And once you get the thing in the
     sextant, then you can go ahead and treat it like
     any other PICAPAR.

[501858]

CDR: That sounds great, Ken. One little problem:
     there's all sorts of bright objects floating
     around us, and also that just staring at part
     of Aquarius; it's just reflecting light like
     mad. We can give it a try. There's no problem
     there; if we can see it, we'll get it.

[501878]
_page : 742
_tape : Tape 93/5
CC:  Okay. And in - in the event that that doesn't
     work, we're standing by with the original scheme,
     a set of LM FDAI angles to fly to that'll point

CDR: Okay. I take it that, if - if Jack cannot see
     stars at this attitude after you give him the
     coarse aline angles, we're just not going to
     read down to you our gimbal angles and have you
     figure out a target angle for Jack, but you want
     him to do sighting on the Moon and the Sun. Is
     that correct?

[502526]
_page : 743
_tape : Tape 93/6
CC:  That's roughly correct, Jim. Jack will coarse
     aline at that attitude. This is what we're having you maneuver to the - to that attitude for.
     We're going to compute coarse aline gimbal angles
     and pass them up to him, and the first thing he'll
     do when he gets there, per his checklist, is to
     coarse aline his platform. Then he'll go into
     the P52, and, if he can't see stars, we will
     quickly pass up to you the - your FDAI angles to
     put him in the Moon-view attitude, and he'll do
     his P52 on the Moon, and then have you maneuver
     on the Sun and complete the P52 of the Sun.

[502571]
_page : 743
_tape : Tape 93/6
CDR: Okay. But I'm going to have to maneuver to the
     Moon to help him out.

[502575]
_page : 743
_tape : Tape 93/6
CC:  Oh. That's - That's affirmative. If he can't
     see stars at the - at the SEP attitude that -
     that you'll be holding, you'll have to maneuver
     to the Moon attitude and then to the Sun attitude
     for him.

     reason, we run out of time or something and
     don't complete the Moon-Sun P52, Jack will have
     a platform coarse aline to the entry REFSMMAT,
     which we feel will be plenty good enough.

     the CSM coarse aline gimbal angles based on your
     being at the service module SEP attitude at the
     time that Jack cranks up the computer and - and
     coarse alines the IMU. That is, we assume that
     you're going to be at roll, 0; pitch, 091; yaw, 0;
     and, if you concur on that, I'd like to pass up
     the angles for - for Jack to have.

     the commencement of command module powerup, and
     we wanted to just mention to you for Jack's
     benefit that, although the batteries are looking
     real good, in case they're cool and have a little
     difficulty hacking the load just at first, we'd
     like him to monitor main bus voltage to 24 volts
     or above during the powerup procedure and, if it
     falls below, we'll have a couple of circuit
     breakers for him that - that will solve the problem.

[504093]

     If you do get into a bind and don't come up - 
     that's amp-hours - don't come up with Recovery,
     you can always power down and you can always
     put the pyro batteries on the line if you need

     it looks as though battery C will deplete around
