     we recommend 20 degrees there, and we recommend
     that you look for 8 degrees instead of 6 degrees

_tape : 
CC:  Okay. With the direct sunlight from the window,
     out of the TV camera field as it is now, we'd
     like you to open it up an f-stop or so and, if
     convenient, try to keep that bright spot out of
     the window.

[12280]
_page : 28
_tape : 
LMP: Okay.

[12374]
_page : 28

[12386]

      the monitor here.

[12621]

      pumping up Aquarius here.

[12714]
_page : 28
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. About all we see on this picture, Fred,
     are the bright spots with the lights around the
     tunnel area. The hatch itself is pretty dark.

[12717]
_page : 28
_tape : 
CC:  13, Houston. By the way, we'd like to know how
     the high gain antenna lockup worked. Our signal
     strength is a little bit lower than we thought
     it would be.

[12786]
_page : 28
_tape : 
CMP: It looked Just the way I expected it to, Joe. I
      had her sitting there in REACQ with the numbers
      cranked in and soon as we got pretty much through
      the rotation, I Just threw it down to HIGH GAIN
      and it appeared to lock right up.

[13014]
_page : 29

      any detail up in there at all? On the monitor

      he hit Baja in the picture now.

     you feel you're safely clear of the booster, and
     give us the GO to command the booster in its yaw
     maneuver.

[14679]

      her back up again yet.

[14695]

      wait, or do you want to do it right now?

      the TD and E fuel was?

[14769]
_page : 32
_tape : 
CC:  Jack, they're not willing to pin it down to a
     specific number right now because they say the
     tanks will warm up later on and the apparent
     consumption will go down. But it was nominal.

[14780]

     there for a few seconds, and we don't have one at
     this moment.

      it doesn't seem to be a lot of debris or vapor
      coming out of it.

     around facing the Earth again, that you catch
     another one of those pictures, and at the same
     time, you should probably start PTC again. We
     might have sent a confusing bit of info up to
     you. The "disable two quads" only applies to an
     early step in the procedure. We didn't mean that
     for the latter part of the procedure where we
     have the statement "enable all jets." Over.

[29318]
_page : 44
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. On checklist G/8-2 under step 5, there's
     a statement, "disable all jets on two adjacent
     quads," and that's what we were referring to when
     we called up saying "disable quads A and B." So
     that's all fine; however, going down now to step 7
     where it says "enable all jets," we hoped that
     you didn't think we meant leave A and B disabled
     there. In that case, it's as written. All jets
     should be enabled. Over.

[29360]
_page : 44
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Our checklist has "all jets" scratched out,
      and it says "enable couples on all axes." So what
      we'll do is - we'll reestablish this thing and
      come down to that step 7, and we'll enable all
      jets. That means enable quads A and B. Is that
      right ?

[29382]
_page : 44

[33851]
_page : 47
_tape : 
CC:  Jim, Houston here. Two items: first of all,
     your PTC is looking very good and it should
     carry you through the night; second point, have
     a procedure to give you, if you're ready to
     copy. We'd like to set three bits in the computer,
     and I'll explain why.

[33883]
_page : 47
_tape : 
LMP: Go ahead, Vance, we're ready to copy.

[33886]
_page : 47
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. The procedure is as follows: VERB 25,
     NOUN 07, ENTER; 1331, ENTER; 7, ENTER; and ENTER.
     Explanation as follows. During the P23s, there
     was one time when VERB 37 was entered into the
     computer at about 16 seconds after the OPTICS
     ZERO switch was flicked to ZERO. This is a very
     uncommon anomaly in that, if you do this during -
     0.4-second interval at around 16 seconds after
     you zero the optics, some OPT-mode bits are
     reset; and this would mean that, if you had a
     OCDU fail, it wouldn't be indicated; so all this
     procedure is doing is setting these three bits
     back again where they should be.

[33961]
_page : 47
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, Vance, and I guess I'll try to be slower
      on that VERB 37.

[33967]
_page : 47
_tape : 
CC:  Yes. Actually slower or faster, either one, I
     guess. Well, yes, slower. It's a very unusual
     thing to have that happen.

[33979]

     you turn in before that time, why it's okay as far
     as we're concerned down here to close it before
     that time just before you go to bed. The second
     point, we have some results on the P23s, and, if
     Jack's interested, we could give him the corrected
     altitudes we're getting, and so forth.

[41478]
_page : 54
_tape : 
CMP: Yes. I sure am, Vance.

[41486]
_page : 54
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. This is preliminary results, but it will
     give you some indication. Corrected altitude is
     turning out to be 17 plus or minus 4 kilometers,
     and the fact that it's plus or minus 4 kilometers
     indicates that you're being very consistent in
     judging the altitude. The effective altitude is
     turning out to be 10 plus or minus 12 kilometers.
     Comments are that, as I said before, you're being
     consistent on the horizon selection. The sub-
     stellar point error is averaging 15 arc-minutes
     and if you could hold the rates to a minimum, you
     might shoot for 5 arc-minutes. That's the only
     comment there. Over.

     and on time. And it's holding real firm now.
     For your information, and you don't need to copy
     this down, because it's still pretty soft, but
     we have an S-IVB impact of about 8.57 south and
     about 33.9 west, which is a little west and a
     little south of the flight plan value. We have
     it at a GET of about 77 plus 51 which is just
     before AOS, and the LOI pads are a little bit
     late, and as I say, it's still pretty soft, and
     we'll be updating you with firm numbers.

     "More specifically on item 2," and item 2 says,
     "Were there any significant changes in the noise
     vibration level during the single stage of
     powered flight?" Specifically, describe your
     observations during the early S-II center engine
     out-off, and approximately 90 seconds prior to
     TLI cut-off, you reported a high vibration in
     the S-IVB. We'd like you to describe the buildup
     of this vibration and its behavior through cut-
     off. Over.

[84302]
_page : 66
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Essentially, what you'd like us to talk
      about is vibration sequence during the early
      S-II cut-off of the center engine and also
      describe the vibrations that we encountered
      during the S-IVB TLI burn. Is that correct?

[84317]
_page : 66
_tape : 
CC:  That's it. Okay. The second extra question is
     for you, Jim, and it says, "Comparing this flight
     with your ride on Apollo 8, were there any sig-
     nificant differences in the powered flight
     environment?"

[84335]
_page : 66
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. We'll describe a comparison with 8 and 13
      as far as powered flight goes.

[84341]
_page : 66
_tape :

     did the ORDEAL ball look like during TLI? As
     you know, we passed you an update to that setting,
     and we'd like to know whether it was riding right
     on zero or what during the burn. Over.

     sports, what the heck. The Astros survived 8 to 7,
     the Braves got five or six runs in the - five runs
     in the ninth inning, but they just made it; and in
     the other important game of the day, the Cubs were
     rained out. I have all the rest of the scores,
     you can tell me if you want any of them. They
     had earthquakes in Manila and other areas of the
     island of Luzon. There were three tremors and
     they kept the buildings shaking for about a half
     an hour or so, and it was about a 5 on the Richter
     scale. Okay, let's see. The Beatles have an-
     nounced they will no longer perform as a group.
     The quartet is reported to have made in excess of
     a half billion dollars during their short musical

     for you right now is an update to your P37 pad
     for lift-off plus 35. This is a change to the
     pad we gave you yesterday. The reason for the
     update is for weather avoidance in the mid-Pacific
     landing area at 70 hours, which is the return time
     for this pad, and in case the question arises in
     your mind, we don't expect any problem there for
     the end of the mission. The weather area is
     20 degrees south of your end-of-mission landing
     point, and it appears to be moving to the south.

_page : 72
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Stand by 1.

[90720]
_page : 72
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Houston; 13. In answer to Question 1, the
      changes in noise level occurred mainly between
      the first stage and the other stages - the other
      stages were about the same in noise level, very
      quiet, with the first stage, of course, making
      quite a bit of noise in the beginning but - which
      built up during the high Q, and then ... went
      quiet just after high Q.

[90751]
_page : 72
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, copy that, Jim.

[90757]
_page : 72
_tape :

      first stage was not sufficient to be uncomfortable
      at all.

[90766]
_page : 72
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. And I assume COMM was okay.

[90770]
_page : 72

      throughout the entire flight. Much better than
      I expected.

[90777]
_page : 72
_tape : 
CC:  Okay.

[90784]
_page : 72
_tape : 
CDR: Now, in answer to Question 2, there was, of course,
      a vibration transient in the second stage that -
      due to the number 5 engine going out - which
      occurred shortly before the engine went out, and
      slightly after that then the S-II stage was very
      smooth.
      	Tape 17/2
      	Page 66
      

[90813]
_page : 73
_tape :

     is that you didn't notice the vibration before
     you saw the engine light.

[90819]
_page : 73
_tape : 
CDR: That's right. We - we noticed the vibration but
      it wasn't such that we thought something cata-
      strophic was going to happen; it just started
      vibration and then the EN light came on, and then
      the vibration went away and the stage itself was
      smooth.

[90839]
_page : 73
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, copy that.

[90843]
_page : 73
_tape : 
CMP: Yes, and that - it was all pretty - pretty short in
      span - Just a second or so before and like a second
      afterwards, Joe.

[90854]
_page : 73
_tape : 
CC:  Oh. Roger.

[90858]
_page : 73
_tape : 
CDR: And on the S-IVB, the vibration of the vehicle it-
      self wasn't what ... second ... powered flight - a
      very-high-frequency vibration.

[90873]
_page : 73
_tape : 
CC:  That was - was that during - just during TLI, or
     did you notice that at insertion?

[90885]
_page : 73
_tape : 
CDR: Well, it was a high-frequency viola - vibration
      but more noticeable during the TLI burn than it
      was during the ... flight.

[90899]
_page : 73
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, I - understand.

[90913]
_page : 73
_tape : 
CMP: I guess the S-IVB vibration during TLI was there
      all the time although it seemed to - to grow to
      us as the burn progressed, although that may have
      been just due to the boost weight decrease.

[90930]
_page : 73
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, you called this about 3-1/2 minutes, but I
     guess the thing was slowly building up throughout
     the whole burn. Right?

[90937]
_page : 73
_tape : 
CMP: That's right.

[90940]
_page : 73
_tape :

     vision to degrade or anything like that?

[90946]
_page : 73

      recalling the ride on 8, and the S-IVB was more -
      much more smooth than even it was on 13.

_page : 74
_tape :

      perience any unexpected transients except that
      all of us noticed the PU shift. We thought it
      was more pronounced than we had expected it to be.

[90999]
_page : 74
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Understand.

[91002]
_page : 74
_tape : 
CMP: Joe, on that. I guess most of every time that PU
      shift occurred we all - almost all of us glanced
      at the engine light. We could feel definite
      acceleration change.

[91013]
_page : 74
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. Understand, Jack.

[91018]
_page : 74

      Alfa meter, to my knowledge, nearly went above
      25 percent.

[91026]
_page : 74
_tape : 
CC:  Okay.

[91034]
_page : 74
_tape : 
CDR: In answer to number 4, we got a pretty good look
      at the thermal shroud and the IU after taking the
      LM away, and from our viewpoint, the shroud was
      completely intact. I saw no loose particles or
      parts of it floating at all.

[91050]
_page : 74
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. Understand.

[91060]
_page : 74
_tape :

      at any time did we have any communication problem
      during powered flight.

_tape : 
CC:  Roger.

[91079]
_page : 74
_tape :

      no. We saw no venting or suspected leak on the
      LM or the CSM ...

[91094]
_page : 74
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. I guess you described to us the non-
     propulsive venting on the S-IVB after the APS
     maneuver and we copied that at the time.

[91110]
_page : 74
_tape :

[91113]
_page : 74
_tape :

      that was also visible when it - of course, when
      it did its evasive maneuver when we were looking
      at it right close up.

[91124]
_page : 75

[91152]
_page : 75
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Joe. The last time we saw the S-IVB posi-
      tively was when Fred saw it venting at about - at
      about 5 hours. We think we might have picked it
      up later on. We saw a particle or something out
      there that was tumbling which might have been the
      booster or one of the SLA panels.

[91174]
_page : 75
_tape : 
CC:  And when was that, Jim?

[91181]
_page : 75
_tape :

      say 7:30 and 9 hours.

[91187]
_page : 75
_tape :

[91190]
_page : 75
_tape :

      The object I was looking at was definitely
      tumbling.

[91201]
_page : 75
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Fred. As I recall, it was stable then,
     although it's tumbling now.

[91208]
_page : 75
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. It probably was the SLA panel I picked up.

[91214]
_page : 75
_tape :

     ing 6 - -

[91217]

[91218]
_page : 75
_tape : 
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[91219]
_page : 75
_tape : 
CDR: I - I think we answer to number 9. We - at
      around 5:32, I think, was when we think the
      number 5 light came on in the S-II, and a
      definite vibration which was more than just a
      high-frequency vibration we got with the normal
      S-IV burn, and then the light came on. I called
      ECO thinking from the training that it was 7:42
      and looked up at the time and realized it was
      early. And then, soon after the light came on,
      the vibration stopped and the engine or the
      booster smoothed down. It was very smooth from
      there on.

[91259]
_page : 75
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. This may be a stupid question, but do you
     have any idea what the frequency of it was?

[91268]
_page : 75
_tape : 
CDR: Only to say that it was much higher - I couldn't
      really guess now. It was rather a rapid longi-
      tudinal vibration.

_tape :

      vibrations?

[91400]
_page : 76
_tape : 
CC:  I don't think so. When you get all done, I'll -
     I'll make a quick check to see if the booster
     people have any - any additional questions. You
     skipped number 8, Jim; could you go back to that
     for a second?

[91414]
_page : 76
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, stand by.

[91434]
_page : 76
_tape : 
CDR: Our only comment there, Joe, was that the burn on
      TLI, to our knowledge, was about 3-3/4 second
      longer than had been predicted and that was the
      only thing that we really noticed; otherwise,
      looked like PI [?] was nominal at cut-off.

[91451]
_page : 76
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, understand.

[91463]
_page : 76
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, on comparing the flight of 13 to Apollo 8,
      lift-off was about the same amount of vibration
      as I noticed on 8, but at the beginning of the
      flight, there was less of the sideways motion
      than we experienced on Apollo 8. The S-IC separa-
      tion felt more violent on 13 than it did on 8,
      maybe that's because I was in a different seat, I
      don't know. But there was about three sharp
      transients of the cut-off and a couple of big
      bangs where we were thrown backwards longitudinally
      on our straps before the S-II went off. And the
      S-II was, of course, Just as smooth on 13 as 8
      except for the number 5 engine. And we did not
      experience the vibration that we experienced on
      8 towards the end of the S-II burn. And the
      S-IVB was - had more vibration than we had on 8.

[91531]
_page : 76
_tape :

[91539]
_page : 77
_tape : 
CDR: The up - the update on the ORDEAL ball was a
      good one. At the burn, we were about - just
      about 8 degrees. We had to pitch down. The yaw
      was right on all the way through the entire burn,
      and just towards the end of the burn, the ball
      started going black in pitch a little bit.

[91563]
_page : 77
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, sounds good, we'll give Mike Wash a gold
     star on that one. Okay, Jim, stand by 1 while
     I see if we have any extra questions.

[91604]
_page : 77
_tape : 
CC:  Jim, while we're waiting to see if they have any
     more questions, I'd like to read you the booster
     people's preliminary analysis on the - the S-II
     cut-off. Over.

[91618]
_page : 77
_tape : 
CDR: That would be very interesting. Go ahead.

[91620]
_page : 77
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, preliminary analysis of the data indicates
     that the center S-II engine vibrated at a some-
     what higher amplitude than we've seen on previous
     flights, and it started at about 160 seconds into
     the S-II burn. As a result of these vibrations,
     the engine chamber pressure decreased to the level
     where the two low-level thrust sensors, the thrust-
     okay sensors, initiated center engine cut-off.
     Early evaluation of data indicates that no damage
     occurred to the engine, and the cause of the in-
     creased vibration amplitude is still under inves-
     tigation. Over.

[91663]
_page : 77
_tape : 
CDR: I thought it was the center engine.

[91668]
_page : 77
_tape : 
CC:  Yes, right.

[91678]
_page : 77
_tape : 
CDR: Joe, do you have any word on what marks we had
      for TLI?

[91684]
_page : 77
_tape : 
CC:  At the time of TLI, as I recall, you had 6 seconds
     longer than the nominal burn which was 3 seconds
     longer than the B-sigma low burn, and you were
     also GO for a second-opportunity TLI if we had re-
     quired one.

[91704]
_page : 77
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, we were just wondering because it appeared
      to us that we had a longer TLI burn than had been
      predicted.

[91710]
_page : 77
_tape : 
CC:  Yes, you did. We confirmed that - that - that
     cut-off time just about as you saw it, and I don't
     have an explanation for it, but it was within the
     B-sigma margin.

[95358]
_page : 78
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, Joe. Out window 5, I just picked up the
      tumbling object again so, for sure, it must have
      been a SLA panel. I don't think we could still
      be in the proximity of the S-IV at this time.

[95373]
_page : 78
_tape : 
CC:  I don't think so, Fred. It's several hundred
     miles aft of you. 700 miles is - is the number,
     I'm told. And since the SLA panel didn't make the
     midcourse correction, that might be it.

_page : 79
_tape : 
LMP: Yes, it's, I can't really tell for sure even
      through the monocular that it is, but it looks
      the same relative position to the stars. And
      the best I can tell about the same intensity and
      still about the same distance from us.

[95408]

     or is it a point?

[95419]

      side not only is facing me, it's not only much
      brighter, it also grows larger.

[95434]
_page : 79
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Very interesting. We'll see if we can
     figure out where that's relative to you. They
     keep updating the S-IV impact on us a little bit.
     The last guess we had was that it will impact
     about the same longitude we gave you but close
     to zero latitude and a little bit later. You
     still won't be able to see it. And they're say-
     ing it might make a - -

[95462]
_page : 79

LMP: Roger.

[95463]
_page : 79

[95479]
_page : 79

[108844]

[108861]
_page : 85
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Vance. We're pointed just a little ways
      off from looking directly at the Moon. Jim is
      holding the camera through window 3. The Sun is
      coming at about 40 degrees off our left side, and
      what we are going to show you in just a minute
      is about 30 seconds of waste water dump and just
      show you just what it looks like. It's really
      fantastic.

[108889]
_page : 85
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We'd like to see that.

[108929]
_page : 85
_tape :

     little while, Jack. Now we don't see anything.

[108940]
_page : 85
_tape : 
CDR: Actually, Vance, what you're looking at is solid
      water droplets coming out just about all the time.
      It lights up the whole sky around the Moon. It's
      Just far too fine for you to see. Now I think
      they're coming out a little thicker.

[108953]
_page : 85
_tape :

      be traveling in the same direction.

[109054]
_page : 86
_tape :

      the lower part of your screen.

[109061]
_page : 86
_tape : 
LMP: I've got the f-stop all the way open now, Vance;
      that's quad - quad 1 you're looking at with the
      LM should - The Moon should be in view Just over
      the top of the quad.

[109078]
_page : 86
_tape : 
CC:  Right. We see the nozzle of the quad, but it's
     dark and it's not easy to see.

[109108]
_page : 86
_tape : 
CC:  13, Houston. INCO suggests you try AVERAGE if
     you're in PEAK to see if that gives us a better
     picture.

[109121]
_page : 86
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. We're in AVERAGE now.

[109142]
_page : 86
_tape :

[109163]
_page : 86
_tape :

     from the bright area or else move it back to PEAK.
     Over.

[109208]
_page : 86
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, Vance. I cranked the focus down a little
      bit. Is the quad coming in any better now?

[109217]
_page : 86
_tape : 
CC:  It's coming in about the same, Fred, and you're
     a little weak now on the COMM..

[109232]

_tape :

[109250]
_page : 86
_tape :

     it's near the center of our screen, Just a little
     to the left. Very clear.

LMP: Yes. I show it just about at 38.

[109351]
_page : 87
_tape : 
LMP: I don't know if you can make out the features
      there, Vance, on the Moon, but it looks like the
      terminators are at central plains area somewhere
      around Descartes, maybe.

[109365]
_page : 87
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We're - We see it just as a bright portion
     of the lunar disk, and it looks a lot like you
     see it from Earth. Very bright. We are unable
     to see any features at all.

[109389]
_page : 87
_tape : 
LMP: It's pretty much the same with the eyeballs in
      here, and it looks a little bigger now. But the
      only way I could see it very good at all was with
      the monocular, a little while ago.

[109411]
_page : 87
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Fred. Very good. We'd be interested to
     seeing the cabin when you get ready for that, too.

[109419]

_tape : 
LMP: Okay. I'll set up now.

[109439]
_page : 87
_tape : 
CDR: And, Vance, we're counting down to midcourse-2,
      we're up to, in our checklist, to minus 6 minutes
      to go.

[109448]
_page : 87
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. Minus 6 minutes. Understand you're about
     ready to turn on the gimbal motors and all that
     sort of thing. Okay. We see the computer now in
     the upper middle part of the - the panel. I think
     we see somebody's checklist in the center couch.
     It must be Jim holding the checklist.

[109479]
_page : 87
_tape : 
LMP: Right. And what Jim's holding now, he's got a
      pen in his hand we've rigged on a string, as sort
      of a simple-minded accelerometer. This burn's
      pretty short and I'm not sure even that's going
      to show very much. But we'll see if it'll stretch
      out at the end of its string.

[109502]
_page : 87
_tape : 
CC:  Yes. We see the pencil at the top of the picture
     floating around. And Jack's coming into view now.

[109510]

      for a push there, Vance. I didn't see the accel-
      erometer do a whole lot and it was a little sur-
      prising how slowly the injector valves opened,
      at least on the indicators.

      hidden away. It's been pretty interesting doing
      all the camera work here to get a little extra
      training running the TV here, hopefully for when
      we get on the ground at Fra Mauro. The monitor
      does make it pretty easy though.

     knowing is what you do after the burn in the way
     of configuring switches back. We - We heard you
     go through the checklist. But, I guess right
     now, basically, you probably have all the switches
     back in position and you're in the mode to con-
     tinue on with - Okay. What does the flight plans
     say? You're going to be doing cislunar naviga-
     tion. So, Jack you're going to be down in the
     LEB. Is that correct?

_tape : 
LMP: And what I wanted to point out, I don't know if
      it's apparent, but ... to show the advantage of
      doing all the dumps just before the burn, we're
      looking again at the same scene over quad 1 at
      the Moon. And now you don't see all the sparkly
      frozen particles outside there any more. We've
      sort of run off and left them.

[111082]
_page : 97
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. We - We don't see anything out there any-
     more in the way of particles leaving the space-
     craft. We'd suggest, maybe you zoom the Moon in
     a little bit again so we can see the shape of it
     better.

[111131]
_page : 98
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Now you can see a few of the spark -
      sparkling particles going across the screen.
      Those are being emitted from the thrusters.
      Jack's maneuvering the spacecraft now.

[111154]
_page : 98
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We can see those very poorly. Well,
     actually, they are coming in better now. It
     looks like little specks going from the upper
     left part of the screen across to the right, and
     understand those are from the thrusters.

[111419]
_page : 99
_tape : 
CDR: While Jack is getting the sleep station rolled
      up, I thought I would show you one interesting
      corner. We've got a temporary stowage bag here
      and that's where all our wastepaper and all that
      goes while we're - after every meal. It's in
      the right-hand corner down by our dump system.

[111436]
_page : 99
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. Understand. We're looking at the
     wastebasket.

[111446]
_page : 99
_tape : 
CDR: And the age-old question that is always asked us
      is how do we get rid of liquid waste and that
      line that you see, I think you can see it now,
      it goes right outside where we open up the over-
      board drain dump, and all of our waste products,
      liquid waste products, go out through that line
      and get dumped overboard.

[111465]
_page : 99
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. Understand, and we can see somebody's
     foot, as well.

[111471]
_page : 99
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Fred is now going down there, and he is
      going to try to get underneath the sleep station
      on his side where we have a sleep restraint. And
      the whole object of that is to ... to position
      the body between the - between the bottom of the
      spacecraft and - so it doesn't float up between
      that and the bottom of the couch.

[111494]

     coming into view underneath the couch. It's the
     white object.

      right now. It's the black lines in that white

      When we first heard about them in the design of

      they turned out to be very nice devices to sleep
      in.

      you how it works. I keep floating up, though,
      but maybe we can get a little shot here.

     NOUN 88 values are R<sub>1</sub> plus 34717, R<sub>2</sub> minus 08028;
     R<sub>3</sub> plus 35075. Take three photos one each at 5-,
     20-, and 60-second time exposure using manual
     optics. Shaft will be 000.8 degrees, trunnion
     12.5 degrees. Comment: Strip off about 50 frames;
     that is, 2 seconds of - at 24 feet per second be-
     fore the first frame and after the last frame of
     the photos. That is, 2 second - 2 seconds at

LMP: Okay. The time is - The event will be at 32:00;
      and we're to maneuver to the following attitude;
      roll 101.0, pitch 090.0, yaw all zips. High
      gain angles will be pitch minus 23, yaw 93. And
      we're to use normal PTC procedures to damp the
      rates. And after damping the rates and before
      spinup, we're to put the DAC on the sextant with
      the magazine G, very high-speed black and white
      film. Then, we're to take three photos, one each
      at 5-, 20-, and 60-seconds' time exposure using
      audio - AUTO optics. Our NOUN 88 values R<sub>1</sub>
      plus 34717, R<sub>2</sub> minus 08028, R<sub>3</sub> plus 35075. Thence,
      three more photos, one each at 5-, 20-, 60-seconds'
      time exposure using manual optics. Shaft 0.8 de-
      grees, trunnion 12.5 degrees. And we're to take
      2 - second bursts at 24 frames per second, before
      and after these pictures.

     reminder on the PTC that R<sub>1</sub> should be 375 -
     0.375 degrees as last night, to get 0.3-degree
     rotation rate. The second one - -

[115020]
_page : 103
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Copy that.
      	Tape 21/3
      	Page 97
      

[115022]
_page : 104
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. The second one, at 32 hours looking at
     Bennett's Comet - we want the pictures taken when
     the spacecraft is as stable as it's going to be
     before starting PTC. The stability requirement
     is very high. We weren't sure if you understood
     that from what we passed up. In addition, the
     photographs might not show as much as the eye
     can see of the comet, so if you see anything
     interesting about the structure of the comet,
     why, sketching it is in order and is encouraged.
     Over.

[115070]
_page : 104
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Vance. What we'll do is, when we get to
      attitude, we'll disable the quads and do like we
      did last night; we'll let GUIDO and you people
      down there tell us when you think we are stable
      enough; then we'll do all this work with the DAC
      on the sextant, first; and then when we get that
      done, we'll go back and put the sextant eyepiece
      back on and see what we can observe visually.

[115098]
_page : 104
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. That sounds good. Also, while you are
     waiting for the vehicle to stabilize, it might
     be interesting to have the eyepiece on and be
     looking at it visually. Okay. Next item: your
     SPS burn had no anomalies whatsoever. It was a
     very good burn.

[115132]
_page : 104
_tape : 
CMP: OKay. Very good.

[115135]
_page : 104
_tape : 
CC:  Next item: request hydrogen tank 1 HEATER OFF for
     balancing purposes.

[115162]
_page : 104
_tape : 
CC:  And Apollo 13, another item: something that we
     have observed and you might be seeing is a slight
     TCE fluctuation on fuel cell 3. This fluctuation
     has been going from about 152 to 160 over a
     37-second period. It has been seen on other
     flights in the past. No one is worried about it,
     but the usual fluctuation is about 1-1/2 degrees
     instead of 7 seconds, so I thought you should be
     aware of it.

[115207]
_page : 104
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Vance. And one other slight distinction
      we've noted is the flow of hydrogen versus the
      oxygen is not exactly matched on fuel cell 3
      either.

[115226]
_page : 104
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We copy. And the last item: we'd like
     to send you an IRIG update, so at your convenience,
     request P00 and ACCEPT.
     	Tape 21/4

[115246]

[115249]

_tape :

[115280]
_page : 105
_tape : 
CMP: Quad C and D are disabled, Vance.

[115284]
_page : 105
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. Disabled. And down here, we see that
     your hydrogen and oxygen on the fuel cell are
     exactly matched, so we suspect it's purely a
     spacecraft read-out problem.

[115300]
_page : 105
_tape : 
CMP: Okay.

[115466]
_page : 105
_tape :

      the DSKY so we can load NOUN 88?

[115480]

[115856]
_page : 105
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. You're go for the pictures.

[115861]
_page : 105
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Vance. We tried our AUTO OPTICS and couldn't
      pick it up there. We're pointing pretty much
      right into the Sun, and things are pretty well
      washed out. And I've gone to MANUAL OPTICS and
      I'm trying to get 0.8, 12.5 on the shaft and
      trunnion, and I still can't pick it up. So -
      it's very light in the sextant, so I kind of think
      maybe we're too near the Sun to see it.

[115888]
_page : 105
_tape : 
CDR: That's right, Vance. The sextant is all - it's -
      it's all milky and it - any comet that could be
      seen through there is just going to be missed in
      the background.

[115901]
_page : 105
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, we copy that. We got some discussion.
     Stand by.

[116015]
_page : 105
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Vance, it isn't - we're not looking into the
      Sun - what we are getting is a large reflection
      from the Sun behind us off the LM; and it is -
      it is coming on that quad i there, and that quad
      is reflecting back into the sextant.

[116034]
_page : 105
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jack. Understand. Just a question: if you
     look through the telescope, can you see the comet
     at all? Over.

[116047]
_page : 105
_tape : 
CMP: No, I can't, Vance. It's - it's still too light.

     here on your trying to observe the comet, and this
     reflection is not unexpected. And give us another
     minute, and we'll be back with you on something
     on that.

[116306]
_page : 106
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. I doubt very seriously though, if we take
      any photographs with high-speed black and white
      with the light coming into the sextant that you're
      going to get anything out of it.

[116322]
_page : 106
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Unanimous opinion is that you're right, and
     we'll scratch all of this Bennett Comet stuff on
     the way out, with the hope that conditions will
     be more favorable after TEI. Over.

[116344]

     we can generate the pads that we have yet to
     send up before the sleep period, so we could sup-
     port an earlier sleep period if you so desired.
     And - but, it will take us 30 minutes to get that
     stuff. The other thing is any time you're ready
     to copy, I can read up the solo book changes.
     Over - And, also, two pages in the flight plan.

[117841]
_page : 107
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Vance. We're about ready to copy the solo
      book changes and the flight plan changes, and
      whenever your pads are ready, we'll take those.
      And as far as moving up the sleep period, that's
      fine, but we'll - if we don't go to sleep right
      away, we'll use it to get out some of our lunar
      maps and study them.

[117861]
_page : 107

[118475]
_page : 110
_tape :

     and all in parentheses after that, like the

     scratch out "PRO to start pitch rate." In paren-
     theses, "0, 230 slash 018, 0."

[118510]
_page : 110
_tape :

[118512]
_page : 110
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Looking to the right, the LM attitude or
     rather the CSM attitude will be incorrect, so
     you can cross that off. And beneath the picture
     of the moon, cross out the - in parentheses,
     "108.19" and the "0 230/018, 0"

_page : 110
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. The information beneath that starting
     with "Configure camera earthshine photos" down
     through "Replace dark slides" is optional. So
     just put in "Earthshine optional" as a comment
     there, and in the camera settings, in the block
     that has "f:2.8 125, infinity," cross out the
     "125" and put in "one-eighth," 1 slash 8, in
     other words.

[118638]
_page : 110

     This is "Earthshine optional."

     near the top of that section that we called
     optional, where you have "bracket MIR f:0.9, 125,"
     cross out the "125" and put in "1 slash 60."
     In other words, one-sixtieth. Over.

      60."

     "Solar corona, optional," and on that first line
     of that optional where it says "VERB 49, maneuver
     to solar corona and limb brightening attitude,"

     well, on the right-hand half of the page, there's
     a line which states "Visual target 16, south,
     180 plus 1:11, Gassendi, f:15." Request you
     cross out that line.

     Cross out "Maneuver to contamination field
     photography attitude," and all other lines
     below that through "Enable thrusters A3, C4,
     B3," et cetera.

[119946]
_page : 116

      tion field photography," and we cross out every-
      thing down to and including "Enable thrusters A3,
      C4, B3, and D4."

[119956]
_page : 116
_tape :

     changes - flight plan changes we have. And Ken
     is coming on now and later sometime when we get

     work your way from east to west and the charts

     is, all of your P23 batch - two marks have been
     evaluated and - Hey, congratulations. Looks
     real good; they're very happy with it. You're
     down to 4 arc-minutes on the substellar-point
     aspect of it, and that's the first thing to
     mention. The second is, unless you see a need,
     I don't see any need for you to read back the
     information we gave you on the solo book and so
     forth. Do you concur?

[121880]

_tape : 
CMP: Roger. I think I got it. I remembered a lot of
      it, and so I think with what you gave me and what
      I remember, I'm pretty sure we got it right.

[121896]
_page : 118
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, and the third item, I was just about to
     call that your rates were stabilized to start
     the PTC, but it looks like they're Jiggling around
     again from a dump, so we'll stand by some more.

_tape : 
CC:  Jim, Just an item for you amd Fred to be thinking
     about in case you haven't been briefed on this,
     something that's now being talked about a little
     bit. These conservative people would like to
     have you read the SHe tank pressure when you go
     into the LM for the LM familiarization at
     58 hours. If there's no midcourse-3, and it
     looks like there's a good chance that there will
     not be, why, they might want to move the LM
     familiarization up from 58 to 55 hours. Over.

[127670]
_page : 122
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. If we don't have a midcourse-3, then we'll
      probably move LM FAM up to 55 hours, in which
      case we'll go in there and read SHe tank pressure.

[127682]
_page : 122
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. Along with the other FAM stuff, and it's
     not certain that we want to do this, it's just
     being talked about, so this is Just the informa-
     tion for you.

[127698]

      block data if you have it for us.

[171512]
_page : 129
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Got it right here, Jim, and it follows.
     This is the P37 pad for lift-off plus 60. The
     reason for the update is for weather avoidance
     in the MPL at 119 hours. It's the same one we
     passed you yesterday, and it's the same weather,
     but we still don't expect a problem at the end
     of the mission. GETI is 060:00, DELTA-V<sub>T</sub> 6079,
     longitude minus 153, GET 400K 118:04. Over.

[171569]
_page : 129
_tape :

     update for you, Jim, if you're ready for that.

[171581]
_page : 129
_tape : 
CDR: Ready to copy.

[171583]
_page : 129
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. As of 47 hours, RCS total 1096, quad Alfa
     270, Bravo 278, Charie 270, Delta 278, and the
     H<sub>2</sub> - - They gave me the H<sub>2</sub>s in percent, 76 per-
     cent; and on the O<sub>2</sub> we have 81 percent. However,
     we show the O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 reading off-scale high now.
     We're quite sure it's a sensor failure. We'd
     like you to verify it with your onboard reading.

[171629]
_page : 129
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Stand by.

[171647]
_page : 129
_tape : 
CDR: Joe, we confirm. Our gage reading is - on the
      number 2 O<sub>2</sub> tank is reading off-scale high now,
      but Jack just tells me that it was okay when we
      first looked at it this morning.

[171660]
_page : 129
_tape : 
CC:  We verify that. At 46:115 we had 82 percent and
     apparently when he stirred the, the cryos, the
     sensor broke.

[171679]
_page : 130
_tape : 
CC:  So it's no problem. You're above nominal on all
     your consumables. On the H<sub>2</sub> tank problem, we
     have a procedure that we'd like you to carry out
     which is simply turning the H<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters
     to OFF at this time s and we want to see whether
     that won't solve the problem of the tank pressure
     setting off caution and warning. We want to look
     at it that way for a few hours.

[171707]
_page : 130
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. You want both H<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters to OFF.
      Is that correct?

[171711]
_page : 130
_tape : 
CC:  That's negative; just tank 2. We want tank 1
     to stay in AUTO.

[171717]
_page : 130
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Tank 2 heaters off at this time.

[171720]
_page : 130
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Good deal. That's been the high tank
     and apparently while waiting for that pressure
     switch to close, to start the heater cycle, the
     tank 1 pressure has been dropping even a little
     bit lower and just setting off caution and
     warning, so we feel if we turn off the tank 2
     heater and let tank 1 activate the heater cycle,
     we won't get into the caution and warning range.

[171894]
_page : 131
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Jack's still off COMM. We'll hold off
      on that a little bit and then we'll pick it
      up when he gets on COMM.

[171901]
_page : 131
_tape : 
CC:  Okay; fine. I've got two updates for you, Jim.
     One is a procedure for looking for Comet Bennett
     at about 49:45, and I'll wait till Jack gets up
     before passing you the details on that. The
     other update is concerned with going into the
     LM 3 hours early, and I think Vance mentioned
     to you last night that this was a possibility,
     that we'd like to look at the SHe tank pressure
     early. And since we're not going to do midcourse
     3, we'd like LM entry at 55 hours. Is that
     okay with you?

[171941]
_page : 131
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Right, that's fine with us. We'll move
      up LM entry to 55 hours.

[171948]
_page : 131
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. I've got some details on the flight plan
     for you as follows. Of course, since there's
     no MCC-3 you'll be deleting all the midcourse 3
     stuff including the - the P52, which is called
     out at about 54-1/2, and we'll be slipping that
     until later, which I'll - which I'll tell -
     which I'll tell - which I'll tell you in a
     minute. Okay. Then you - we want to move the
     battery charge up 3 hours to about 52:30. And
     we want to move the - moving the LM tunnel vent
     valve to LM/CM DELTA-P up B hours to 52:45, and
     at that point you can simply go to the 57-hour
     point in the flight plan and change your number
     from 57 hours to 54 hours and start through that.
     In the remarks section at about 57:50 it says,
     "0<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste water dump," here.
     If not performed earlier, we want you to do that
     at 54 hours and 50 minutes. The TV pass then,
     will be at 55 hours to 55:30. You'll go right
     through the LM Activation checklist stuff. I'm
     losing you; let's wait a minute.

[172061]
_page : 131

_page : 131
_tape : 
CDR: We're back with you.

[172160]
_page : 131
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. I've gone through the battery charge, the
     LM vent valve, the fuel cell purge, and then
     	Tape 31/4
     	Page 125
     
     stop PTC at 55 hours, and your roll attitude	# continued from previous page
     there will be 285 degrees, which is per the
     flight plan. The high gain antenna angles are
     slightly different, pitch 23 and yaw 267 degrees.
     The TV pass till 55:30, the standard LM acti-
     vation except for some special steps we'll give
     you to take a look at SHe tank pressure, which
     I don't have yet. Restart PTC at about 56:30
     or whenever you're through with the LM activ-
     ities, and after that, at your convenience,
     we'd like you to - to do the P52 option 3 that
     we cancelled at 54-1/2 hours. Over.

[172227]
_page : 132
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. That last comment was that we'll do the
      P52 after we start PTC at about 56:30.

[172231]
_page : 132
_tape : 
CC:  That's right. Any time after that; it's not
     time critical.

[172243]
_page : 132
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Let's see if I have some of this, Joe.
      Around 52:30 we're to do the battery charge
      on BAT - battery B.

[172252]
_page : 132
_tape : 
CC:  That's correct.

[172254]
_page : 132
_tape : 
CDR: And then about 52:40 we're going to do the LM
      tunnel vent valve, and the LM/CM DELTA-P which
      has been written up at 55:40.

[172264]
_page : 132
_tape : 
CC:  That's correct.

[172269]
_page : 132
_tape : 
CDR: We're deleting midcourse-3 and we've moved up
      the LM entry to 55 hours. So we'll merely
      follow all the - We'll follow all the procedures
      that leads up to LM entry that was originally
      scheduled for 58.

[172289]
_page : 132
_tape : 
CC:  That's correct. You can start at 57 in the
     flight plan; call it 54 hours and press right
     on.

[172308]
_page : 132
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Then whenever we're finished with the LM,
      which we anticipate around 56:30, we'll commence
      PTC and sometime after that we'll do a P52.

[172319]
_page : 132
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirmative. And did you copy the new
     high gain angles for 55 hours? The ones we
     had - -

[172332]
_page : 132
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. We're going to stop the PTC for LM entry
      at roll 285, and high gain angles are pitch 23
      and yaw 267.

      the LM usually.

      	Page 127
      

[172616]
_page : 134
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. The word on that, Jim, is that they
     want to insure the proper 0<sub>2</sub> concentration in
     the LM when you get to the surface, and this
     is a method of doing that by bleeding out
     additional nitrogen.

[172632]
_page : 134
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Thank you.

[172641]
_page : 134
_tape : 
CC:  And, 13, Houston. If Jack is up, I'd like to
     talk to him about the P52, briefly.

[172649]
_page : 134
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. He's here.

[172651]
_page : 134
_tape : 
CMP: Go ahead, Joe.

[172652]
_page : 134
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jack. What they'd like you to do on this
     P52 at 49 hours, they've been observing a slight
     jitter in the optics shaft angle of about 0.2 of
     a degree plus or minus. Before you come out of
     the OPTICS ZERO position, at the start of this
     P52, they'd like you to just observe the shaft
     readout, and see if the jitter occurs on your
     direct readout there, and also they'd like you
     to briefly call up a VERB 16, NOUN 91 so we
     can look at the shaft and trunnion angles.

[172691]
_page : 134
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Let's see if I got it right. On the P52
      at 49 hours, before coming out of ZERO on the
      OPTICS, observe the shaft and also call up
      16, 91 and let you look at the shaft and trunnion
      angles to observe a possible jitter. See
      whether it occurs in the ZERO position as well
      as out of ZERO.

[172713]
_page : 134
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, Jack. That's correct; and if you have
     time, now, I've got a flight plan update for
     you on looking for the Comet Bennett.

[172730]
_page : 134
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Stand by 1, Joe. And the commander's
      going off the air briefly.

[172738]
_page : 134
_tape :

[172802]
_page : 134

[172804]
_page : 134
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jack. I'm going to read it to you, and
     then add some comments and we'll talk about it
     a little. This should occur sometime after
     49:30. After the P52 realine at 49 hours, if
     time permits we would like the crew to investi-
     gate while in PTC if there is a roll angle in
     	Tape 31/7
     	Page 128
     which the comet can be observed for photos. If # continused from previous page
     there is, record the optimum roll angle for
     possible photography, prior to reinitiating PTC
     at 56:30 or so, whenever the guys are done in
     the LM, use P52 planet option, and the following
     half-unit vectors for tracking Comet Bennett at
     about 49:46. Are you ready to copy half-unit
     vectors? Over.

[172865]
_page : 135
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Go ahead, Joe.

[172867]
_page : 135
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. R<sub>1</sub> plus 0.34202, R<sub>2</sub> minus 0.07374,
     R<sub>3</sub> plus 0.35719. Read back.

[172893]
_page : 135
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Copy R<sub>1</sub> plus 0.34202, R<sub>2</sub> minus 0.07374,
      R<sub>3</sub> plus 0.35719.

[172908]
_page : 135
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. That's correct and the last sentence on
     the update is that you can expect AOS of the
     comet at a roll of 45 degrees and LOS at a roll
     of 155 degrees. Now, the deal here, Jack,
     according to the plots they showed me is, the
     comet appears to be about 10 degrees away from
     the Sun, and due to the geometry of the LM there
     shadowing the Sun, it would appear that you will
     be able to see the comet through the sextant
     without getting Sun shafting between roll angles
     of about 45 degrees and 75 degrees. It appears
     that as your roll gets higher than 75 degrees,
     although the comet is still in the field of view,
     the Sun is also in the field of view, and you
     probably will not have any success between 75
     and 155 if you haven't got it from 45 to 75.
     If you do find that you can see the comet some-
     where between 45 and 75 or 80 degrees, just note
     that roll angle and then if it's feasible we'd
     like you to photograph it after the LM entry
     part of the checklist. Over.

[172990]
_page : 135
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Joe. Let me give it back to you and see
      if I've got it here. After the P52, during our
      PTC you want us to use P52 and observe Bennett's
      Comet through the sextant; note a roll angle if
      we can find it visible. It would be visible
      somewhere between - ideally between 45 and 75
      degrees, and we should lose it about 155 roll,
      and if we do see it, make an observation of
      whether it is photographable, note the roll
      angle for photographs to be taken after or
      prior to initiation of PTC at 56:30.

CMP: Okay, Joe. I got into P52 about 49:34. We loaded
      the planet - or Bennett Comet vectors into the
      planet option, and P52 tracked it all the way
      across except that it was always occulted by the
      LM, and we're in a roll angle of 155 now.

     roll angle were you able to start tracking it,

[179004]
_page : 138
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. At the time we entered it there, we were
      about 66 degrees roll, so either we started too
      late, or maybe somehow we got a wrong calculation
      on the roll angle.

[179020]
_page : 138
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Let me have G&C comment on that. I sus-
     pect that the roll angles we gave you were calcu-
     lated for exactly 90 degrees pitch, and you're
     probably wobbling enough that they're not exactly
     correct.

     with some - with some better numbers based on
     the cone angle that - that you're traveling
     through, whether there are any roll angles that -
     that are available to you. And if there are,
     and we have time, we might give it another try;
     if not, we just will forget it.

_tape :

     figuration on the CRYO O<sub>2</sub> TANKS and give you
     the reason. Right now, we'd like you to go to
     HEATERS tank 1, OFF; tank 2, AUTO, which is the
     opposite of the way you've got them now. Over.

[179395]
_page : 139
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jack. We're getting you back, and I hope
     you copied my - my correction of my mistake.
     I'm talking about the H<sub>2</sub> CRYO TANKS. We'd like
     the tank 1 HEATER to OFF; tank 2 to AUTO. Over.

[179409]
_page : 139
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. We lost you again. Here's our heater
      configuration now. H<sub>2</sub> HEATERS 1, OFF; 2, AUTO.
      Both O<sub>2</sub> HEATERS are in AUTO.
      	Tape 32/4
      	Page 133

[179423]
_page : 140
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. That's the configuration we want you in,
     and here's what we're thinking about. When we
     went to tank 1 AUTO, tank 2 OFF; we found that
     the heater cycle had a tank 1 pressure of about
     233 psi, which is well above the caution and
     warning limit, and if we go to that configuration
     for sleep, we'll keep from getting CAUTION AND
     WARNING lights during the sleep cycle. Okay.
     In order to do that comfortably, we want to spend
     the rest of the day using more H<sub>2</sub> out of tank
     number 2, so as to get an unbalance in favor of
     tank 1, so at the end of the sleep cycle it'll
     all come out even. And that's why we have you
     in tank 1 OFF, tank 2 AUTO, now. We expect to
     get about a 3-percent unbalance over the next
     10 hours; and prior to sleep, we'll call you to
     reverse the configuration again. Now the only
     disadvantage here is that, during tile day, you
     will probably get a few CAUTION AND WARNINGS,
     and we just figured it would be better to get
     them now than while you were sacked out. Over.

[179495]
_page : 140
_tape :

[179497]
_page : 140
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Good deal. One other detail
     for you, Jack; G&C tells us that the OPTICS
     jitter is very similar to what we had on
     Apollo 12. It's no problem, but when you're not
     using the OPTICS, we recommend that you turn the
     OPTICS POWER switch to OFF to guard against a
     possible degradation as the flight progresses.

     observe at 55 hours, and the rationale for it.

_page : 142
_tape : 
CDR: Go ahead, Joe.

[181645]
_page : 142
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Before you start copying, this procedure
     is - is basically simply to activate the supercritical 
     helium pressure gaging so that you can
     read it. And the concern here is lest this
     supercritical helium pressure reach 1800 psi by
     103 hours, at which point we'd be within a pos-
     sibility of rupturing the burst disk when you
     activate the DPS. Now, based on the pressure at
     launch, and based on a nominal rise time of about
     6-1/2 psi per hour between then and now, the pressure 
     should read about 710 psi. Stand by, 13,
     until we get better COMM.

[181723]
_page : 142
_tape : 
CDR: Houston, you were cut out. Would you say again
      about the helium pressure.

[181729]
_page : 142
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. Based on the prelaunch pressure in the
     SHe tank and the nominal rise time of about
     6-1/2 psi per hour, the pressure should be about
     710 at 55 hours. Are you reading? Over.

     Stand by 1.

[181874]
_page : 143
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. i'll put her back to OMNI B if you all
      want to take command again?

[181909]
_page : 143
_tape : 
LMP: And the last thing we heard, Joe, was that the
      SUPERCRIT should be reading about 710 psi.

[181916]
_page : 143
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. That's the last thing I passed up. And
     while we're waiting for INCO to decide here, let
     me continue. The deadband that is considered
     acceptable is between 660 and 770 psi. In other
     words, any rise time that'll give you one - a
     pressure between those two, will keep you below
     the critical pressure at 103 hours or so. So,
     we expect it to read in that - in that band and
     if it does, there will be no problem. If it
     reads between 770 and 800 psi, we will want you
     to check the pressure again at about 59 hours,
     and I'll get the detailed procedures in a minute.
     If the pressure is equal to or greater than
     800 psi, we're going to have to go into some more
     detailed procedures; we're going to try to - to
     get PCM data on it, for one thing. We may have
     to have you sit there and stare at the gage for
     a while to find out when it clicks up and get an
     accurate rise time on it, and then in extreme
     case, we are even thinking about a DPS burn, but
     we don't really think that will happen. Now, if
     you are ready to copy, what I have for you is a
     change or an addition to the LM Activation checklist 
     between pages TLC-1 and TLC-2, which consists
     of seven steps, and if you can find a blank side
     to write it down on, I would like to pass it up.
     Over.

     1 while we get INCO synced up.

[182040]
_page : 143
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. The rest of your update was that it's okay
      if it is anywhere between 660 and 770 psi. If
      it's above 770, you are going to ask us to con-
      sider going back in at 59 hours and either get
      PCM going or sit there and give you gage reading
      changes on the basis of that. And you said something 
      about an extreme measure. We may have to
      consider some sort of DPS maneuver.

     request, perform step 9." In other words, you
     wait for us to decide what to do and that's
     according to the gouge we've already given you.
     And step 9, I'll give you now, is "HELIUM MONITOR
     to OFF, INVERTER to OFF." Over.

[182805]
_page : 146
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Step 8 says, "Set in an MCC hold." Step 9
      says, "On MCC' s words, HELIUM MONITOR OFF, IN-
      VERTER OFF."

[182820]
_page : 146
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. That's correct. Step 10 is, "Configure
     circuit breaker panels per Activation 3 and 4."

[182844]
_page : 146
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Configure - step 10, "Configure circuit
      breakers per Activation pages 3 and 4."

[182851]
_page : 146
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. That's correct. Step 11 is, "Deactivate
     the utility lights if you activated them," and
     step 12 which is the last one is, "Transfer to
     CSM power, usual observations, and report time to MCC."

[182900]
_page : 146
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Step 11, "Deactivate utility lights."
      12, "Transfer to CSM power and note the usual
      observations and report the GET."

[182911]
_page : 146
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. That's it. And, of course, Houston will
     be requesting you to go to step 9 if the pressure
     is less than 770. If the pressure is between
     770 and 800, we will be asking you to do the
     following, if you're ready to copy.

[183026]
_page : 147
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. We'll hold off on that. It was a short
     three-step procedure which said, "Repeat activation pages 
     1, 1A, and 2, "but there was another
     step in it that nobody understands. So, essentially what 
     we'd recommend in that ease would be
     that you would repeat the procedure that we just
     passed up for reading the SUPERCRIT pressure. If
     we need to, we'll clarify it later on. And that's
     all we've got.

      surize CSM to 5.7 psia, we're going to move that

     not going to have to crank up the TM. That's
     the number we were looking for.

[197546]
_page : 156
_tape : 
LMP: Very good. Okay. Do you want me to back out
      of this in reverse at least as far as getting
      this part of it powered down?

      just cranking up high gain now.

[198080]

[198088]
_page : 157
_tape :

[198100]
_page : 157
_tape :

     high gain yet. We're still looking at you.

[198147]
_page : 157
_tape : 
CC:  13, Houston. In this attitude, we'd suggest
     pitch 5, yaw 237 on the high gain. Over.

[198159]
_page : 157
_tape : 
CDR: Pitch 5, yaw 237. Roger.

[198312]
_page : 157
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Jack. Can you - can you read the high gain
      now?

[198324]
_page : 157
_tape : 
CC:  Affirmative, Jack. We've got you on a high gain
     and it appears to us that we're in wide beam - wide beam width.

[198332]
_page : 157
_tape : 
CMP: Yes. We can't get it to come down to narrow.
      We tried to switch to AUTO track or REACQ, and
      it - yaw drives around from 270 to 0. And pitch
      goes from about 6 degrees around to 90. I'm
      trying - we're fitting it manual now at the
      angles that you gave us, and I'll try and get
      you in medium and narrow beam widths picking it
      up manually here.

[198366]
_page : 157
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, Jack. Meanwhile, we'll look at the
     situation you describe there.

[198373]
_page : 157
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. And it does it on both sets of servo
      electronic power.

[198435]
_page : 157
_tape : 
CMP: Jack, what it looks like is that, when we hit
      239 degrees at this attitude, it hit some sort
      of scan limit or something and drops off.

[198453]
_page : 157
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, Jack; thank you.

[198457]
_page : 157
_tape :

      now.

[198474]
_page : 157
_tape : 
CMP: Can you pick up the TV in this condition here
      at all?

[198487]
_page : 157
_tape : 
CC:  Negative, Jack. We'll have to have the narrow
     beam width.

[198494]
_page : 157
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Can you give us, maybe, a slight maneuver?
      	Tape 36/4

_page : 158
_tape :

     circuit breakers down in panel 25. Check your
     high gain group 2 and your high gain in the
     flight bus. Over.

[198559]

     We suggest that you go to roll 285 and try
     pitch 90 and yaw 0. Over.

[198657]
_page : 158

[198904]
_page : 158
_tape : 
CDR: Roger, Houston. What we plan to do for you
      today is start out in the space shipper [sic]
      Odyssey, and take you on through from Odyssey
      in through the tunnel into Aquarius. And show
      you a little bit of the landing vehicle, and
      your TV operator is now resting on the center
      couch, looking at Fred Haise, whose head is now
      Just about at the beginning of the tunnel, and
      his back is against the lower-equipment-bay
      optical area. And Fred will now transport him-
      self into the tunnel, and into the spaceship
      Aquarius.
      	Tape 36/5
      	Page 152

[198948]
_page : 159
_tape : 
LMP: You know one thing I noted, Jack, when I first
      came across here, that starting upright in the
      command module and heading down in Aquarius,
      there's a little bit of an orientation change
      that, even though I'd been through it once in
      the water tank, it still pretty unusual. I
      find myself, now, standing with my head on the
      floor when I get down inside the LM.

[198985]
_page : 159
_tape : 
CC:  That's a great picture, Jim. You got the light
     just right.

[199000]
_page : 159
_tape : 
LMP: And one of the nice things, Jack, particularly
      for a novice like myself, is the - the ease of
      moving around in here. It's, of course, as you
      know from working in the command module simulator,
      it's really quite a boon to have zero gravity
      as an aid. Because you get - pretty confining,
      really, at one g, to move around very much in
      there, and it's quite easy in this environment.
      The LM, as you can see, it looked pretty clean,
      I found a couple of loose washers about it and
      the - a little plastic cap off the sequence
      camera had come loose and I found it lodged over
      by the ED panel. Okay. Right under Jim, now,
      he's actually standing on a - what looks to be
      a can here. And, for the sake of all the people
      back there, housed inside this can is the - the
      LM ascent engine where, hopefully, you can see
      my hand resting on top of right now - the engine
      that we use to get off of the Moon. Immediately
      adjacent to the engine cover here, I have my
      hand on a white box now, which has been shown
      before. This happens to be Jim's PLSS, or the
      backpack which'll supply oxygen and water for
      cooling while on the lunar surface. This device
      we hope to make use of for - a planned 4 hours and
      possibly up to as much as 5 hours. Right - right
      behind the PLSS, a couple of little square pack-
      ages I now have my hand on here, one here and
      one right below, are our OPSs, which are, in
      essence, the emergency oxygen supplies, which
      are good for some 40 to 45 minutes. These are -
      when we get ready to mount up and head outside,
      will be placed up on top of the PLSS.

[199164]
_page : 159
_tape : 
LMP: The second backpack is mounted down on the LM
      floor, I hope, positioned right between the two
      of us. I have my hand on it at this time.

[199391]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, and we see Fred looking in the vacuum
     cleaner there now.

[199402]
_page : 161
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, what I have out now, Jack, is LEVVA, which
      has also been shown before. It's a head garment
      for wearing out on the surface, and I - I'm
      bringing Jim's out here to show a couple of MODs.
      One problem before is that the cast of characters
      down on the surface haven't been able to be dis-
      tinguished apart very well. So, not only Jim's
      suit has some red stripes on it, but as you can
      see his LEVVA also has a - a red stripe. And
      now you can see one other MOD here too, Jack,
      which I hadn't really seen myself before. I
      guess on 12, Pete and A1 had commented about
      the - commented about having trouble with sun-
      light in the eyes, so on our LEWAs they put on
      a new center section which you can pull down
      and use sort of like a baseball cap.

[199496]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Jack. Who fixed up our LEVVAs?

[199512]
_page : 161
_tape : 
LMP: How's the detail on this one, Jack?

[199515]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CC:  Say again, Fred.

[199519]
_page : 161
_tape : 
LMP: Can you see any detail in this picture now, or
      am I blocking out too much of the sunlight?

[199526]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirmative. We've got a good picture
     of the LEVVA there, and it's coming through loud
     and clear.

[199535]
_page : 161
_tape : 
LMP: Okay.

[199554]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Jack, while Fred is putting away my helmet,
      you are looking over into Fred's station now.
      How's this picture, is it okay before - or do I
      have to adjust it?

[199566]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CC:  We have a hunch that the setting might be in
     PEAK but we recommend AVERAGE on the ALC if you
     haven't got it there already.

[199576]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CDR: We're in AVERAGE, Jack.

[199578]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. And we're getting a good picture of the
     LMP side with the DEDA over there.

[199589]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CMP: Hey, Jack, one question on the command module
      here. Do I - I have the DAP right now wide deadband. 
      Do you want me to begin setting up nar
      deadband and nulling the rates to start PTC

[199607]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CC:  Stand by, Jack.

[199651]
_page : 162
_tape : 
LMP: What I'm fishing out now, Jack, is another new
      piece of hardware that we are taking along this
      time as a result of some comments made on the Apollo 12 flight.

[199672]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CDR: What Fred is opening up - is a drink bag
      that we place inside of our neckring that will
      allow us to drink while we are on the lullar surface. 
      They - Pete and A1 - did not have that on
      Apollo 12 and they, consequently, got very
      thirsty. But we hope to alleviate that situation
      by having our own little bag of water which, with
      very little effort, we can have a sip or two
      while we are looking around and doing our geology work.

[199713]
_page : 162
_tape : 
LMP: So if you hear any funny noises, it is just
      probably the drink bag.

[199730]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CDR: Fred, the bag's empty.

[199756]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CDR: Fred is now looking through our optical device.
      It's an instrument in which to aline our platform, 
      and Fred is now looking into it just to
      see what kind of an outside picture he might
      be able to get. We might be able to use a TV
      camera to look through our optical instrument
      to the outside of the command module. A few
      minutes ago while we first came in, we did
      manage to look to the outside of the side hatch
      of the command module through our optical instrument. 
      Stand by. We'll try to see what we can do here.

[199789]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, Jim. Break, Jack, we'd like you to
     stay in the deadband you are now in, and we'll
     make a change when the TV is over. Another
     thing we would like you to do is check your
     pitch and yaw on your high gain meter so we can
     compare it with what we're seeing down here.

[199811]
_page : 162
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, it's showing about - say 28 degrees and 267.
      	Tape 36/9

[199821]
_page : 163
_tape : 
CMP: 28 - 28 and 267.

[199845]
_page : 163
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, Jack, have you got that picture now?

[199849]
_page : 163
_tape : 
CC:  Fred, about one-quarter of our screen is lighted
     and it's impossible to determine what you are
     looking at right now. Maybe you could give us a
     little verbal description.

[199862]
_page : 163
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. It's looking through the AOT in position 4,
      right rear. And we're looking back toward the -
      over the side hatch at the aft side of the service module.

[199888]
_page : 163
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Is - is it too dark a picture, Jack? You
      think the f-stop open may help?

[199894]
_page : 163
_tape : 
CC:  No, Fred, it's got to be centered up a little
     bit. That's primarily what you have to do.

[199903]
_page : 163
_tape : 
CDR: Jack, we can't center it up any more, because
      the side hatch is only one part of the AOT. The
      rest of that blackness you see is really space.

[199931]
_page : 163
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. We'll try another one, and it's a little
      better centered. In fact, the only other one we
      have that shows the whole picture. We're in the
      forward D-10 of the AOT now, position 2, and you
      should be seeing something familiar like a radar
      antenna.

[199961]
_page : 163
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, we see you moving the camera up to the AOT
     lens, and we got a real good picture now.

[199983]
_page : 163
_tape : 
CDR: And -

[200003]
_page : 163
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, Jack, I'm looking out the right window now,
      and not too far off in the distance now, you can
      see the objective, and I'll zoom in on it here a
      little and see if it brings it in better.

[200037]
_page : 163
_tape : 
LMP: And it's actually beginning to look a little
      bigger now. You can see quite distinctly some
      of the features with the naked eye. And so far,
      I guess I have to even agree with Jim that it's
      still looking pretty gray with white spots.

[200079]
_page : 163
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Fred. We're getting a good picture of your
     destination there.
     	Tape 36/i0
     	Page 157

[200104]
_page : 164
_tape : 
CDR: Jack, you've been looking at the - at Fred's
      workshop now, and you can see the abort guidance
      computer. And over there on the - tucked away in
      his armrest, is our activation checklist, which
      we'll be using very shortly. Up on the top of
      the window, we have our camera already mounted
      ready for photographing the descent. And now
      Fred's engaged in his favorite pastime, I found
      out on this flight so far.

[200147]
_page : 164
_tape : 
CC:  He's not in the food locker, is he?

[200152]
_page : 164
_tape : 
CDR: That's his second favorite pastime. He's rigging
      his hammock for sleep on the lunar surface now
      to find out - to see what it's going to be like.

[200163]
_page : 164
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. Sleeping and then eating.

[200189]
_page : 164
_tape : 
LMP: It's kind of difficult here, Jack, getting into
      a hammock in zero g. I'm not sure if I keep
      floating away from it or it keeps moving away from me.

[200210]
_page : 164
_tape : 
CDR: If you notice a few things floating around, we
      found just about one or two washers occasionally.

[200217]
_page : 164
_tape : 
LMP: And for the benefit of those that may wonder
      where Jim sleeps. Be a little difficult to rig
      his hammock in here right now with the hatch open,
      but his runs laterally in this direction, fore
      aft. So he has the upper berth and I get the
      lower berth.

[200254]
_page : 164
_tape : 
CDR: And now while Fred's taking his hammock down and
      restowing it, I might give you some idea of what
      sort of confusion of attitudes since there is no
      up or down, and I 'm situated on top of the ascent
      engine just at the entrance to the tunnel. I'll
      reverse the camera 180 degrees and go from Fred,
      look through the tunnel again back at Odyssey,
      and we might pick up part of Jack.

[200305]
_page : 164
_tape : 
CC:  There he is. We see him.

[200336]
_page : 164
_tape :

      viewers, we've just about completed our little
      inspection of Aquarius, and now we're proceeding
      through the hatchy-gap into the tunnel and going
      back toward the Odyssey.

[200362]
_page : 164
_tape :

      slide on through the tunnel here

[200474]
_page : 165
_tape : 
CDR: Houston, 13. Are you still on TV?

[200477]
_page : 165
_tape : 
CC:  Yes, we sure are. We've got a good picture of
     the skipper there.

[200482]
_page : 165
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. What we can show you now, a little added
      benefit, we've got the drogue on Fred's couch
      in the command module right now. We stowed it
      temporarily while we're checking out the - out
      Aquarius and underneath his couch, we've got the
      probes stowed. Quite a big cumbersome device,
      and we'll get a shot of it for you.

[200533]
_page : 165
_tape : 
CDR: You're looking now at our probe, the place on
      the nose of Odyssey. It's a very heavy thing
      but I suppose in zero gravity it weighs nothing,
      and it's much easier to move around. As a matter
      of fact, both Fred and Jack commented, as many
      people in the past have, of how much bigger the
      spacecraft appears in actual flight when you have
      such ease in moving compared to our simulator
      which make training rather difficult.

[200578]
_page : 165
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We're seeing a good picture of the probe
     there, Jim, and looks like the characters shaved
     before the show this time.

[200590]
_page : 165
_tape :

[200597]

      Jack.

[200601]

      ing some of our time away on our transit to the
      Moon, and it's rather odd to see it floating like
      this in Odyssey while it's playing the theme from
      "2001." And, of course, the tapes wouldn't be
      complete without "Aquarius."

     and just - by the way, how long do you expect to
     keep the TV on this evening?

[200718]
_page : 166
_tape :

_tape : 
LMP: Yes, I got them with the cabin repress valve
      again there, Jack.

_tape : 
CDR: Every time he does that our hearts - our hearts
      jump in our mouth. And, Jack, any time you want
      to terminate TV, we're all set to go.

[200761]
_page : 166
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. It's been a real good TV show. We
     think we ought to conclude it from here now.
     What do you think?

[200771]
_page : 166
_tape : 
CDR: Roger. Sounds good. And this is the crew of
      Apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening,
      and we're just about ready to close out our inspection 
      of Aquarius and get back for a pleasant
      evening in Odyssey. Good night.

[200790]
_page : 166
_tape : 
CC:  Thank you, 13.

[200920]
_page : 166
_tape : 
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. The next thing we'd like you
     to do is to -

[200925]
_page : 166
_tape : 
CMP: Go ahead.

[200926]
_page : 166
_tape : 
CC:  - - we'd like you to roll right to 060 and null
     your rates for photography of the Comet Bennett.
     To do that, we would like you to enable quads C
     and D. For the maneuver, use all your quads.
     And in precisely 1 minute, we'd like you to ter-
     minate the battery charge on battery B. One
     other request, we'd like to have you verify - -

[200952]
_page : 166
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Will do.

[200954]
_page : 166
_tape : 
CC:  One other request, we'd like you to verify your
     high gain configuration. We'd like to know what
     track mode, what SERV0, and what beam width.

[200965]
_page : 166
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Jack, during the TV, we were AUTO TRACK,
      NARROW BEAM WIDTH, and the PRIMARY ELECTRONICS.
      And we had a good lockup. Just after we started
      the maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get
      real good signal strength, and it just seemed
      that right there at about 239 degrees in yaw,
      that the signal strength would just drop off and
      yaw would go to zero and pitch would go to 90.

      on the battery B.

[201098]
_page : 167
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. We see it, Jack. And we got a reading
     of minus 2 degrees on the docking index. We'd

      whatever DPS burns you give us?

LMP: We've lost - The only advantage to doing it early;
      if we can power back - the LM back down. The only
      advantage doing it early is you can do a big burn
      now and a midcourse and then power the LM down.
      Otherwise, we got to keep the LM powered up clear
      until we get around the Moon. Plus it would be
      inside on the burn. I Just hope the G&N hangs up
      on - hangs in on this one - I'd sure hate to do

     pressurized the RCS, we got an increase in pres-
     sure in the ascent tanks, and so we want to have
     you verify that the ascent feeds are closed. In
     order to do that, on panel 11, close the ASCENT
     FEED 1 and 2 circuit breakers on - and cycle the

_tape : 40/13
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. And down here we're getting re-
     grouped, trying to work on your control modes and
     trying to set up something for PTC and taking a
     look at consumables as opposed to flight plan,
     and so forth, and as soon as we get all that in-
     formation, we'll pass it up to you. We also have
     the 14 backup crew over in the simulators looking
     at dock burns and also trying to see what kind of
     alinement procedures they can come up with for
     looking at stars out the window. So if you ever
     are able to see any stars out there and think you
     can do an alinement out the window, why let us
     know.

[215020]
_page : 212
_tape : 40/13
CDR: Okay. Jack, right now we're not able to. The
      sunlight's reflecting off the thrusters and what-
      ever debris came away at the time of the mishap
      is still with us, such that the stars are hard
      to find, and why - what respect do you want us to
      do the stars out the window - Just to check the
      LMS run, is that correct?

[215044]
_page : 212
_tape : 40/13
CC:  That's affirmative. We'd like to correlate the
     information we get with your's, so that if we can
     use it to update the platform, we can. What we're
     really trying to do, Jim, is see if we can do a
     COAS aline so we can power down the platform.

[215123]

     want to know what capability you have to do a
     coarse and fine aline. We read your conversation
     about being unable to see out the window very
     good. How about out the AOT?

LMP: He's looking now.

[216329]
_page : 214
_tape : 40/15
CC:  Okay. And the other thing we thought you might
     try is to put the service module between you and
     the Sun and then to see if you can see anything
     out the window in that attitude.

[216348]
_page : 214
_tape : 40/15
CC:  The reason that we think that that would work
     is that it worked on Apollo 10. It made the
     constellations all recognizable when we put the
     the service module - in our case a LM, between
     us and the Sun.

     me, now?

[217374]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CDR: Okay, we're reading you loud and clear, Jack.
      I hope it stays this time.

[217378]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CC:  Okay. We'd like to brief you on what our plan
     is. We're, at this time, water critical in the
     LM. So we'd like to use as little as possible.
     To do this, we're going to plan to make a free-
     return maneuver of 16 feet per second at 61 hours,
     which is 37 minutes from now. Then we're going
     to power down the PGNS, and then we'll - at
     79 hours, we'll go ahead and make another abort
     maneuver to kick what we got. But we'd like to
     get that PGNS powered down as soon as possible.
     That would be after the midcourse and - so how
     do you feel about making a 16-foot-per-second
     burn in 37 minutes?

[217429]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CDR: Well, we'll give it a try, Jack, if that's all
      we've got. That's a 16-foot-per-second DPS burn
      in 37 minutes?

[217437]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CC:  Roger. We're working up a pad for it, but we'd
     want to know what you think about doing it at
     that time.

[217448]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CDR: Well, we'll do it. Could you give us a little
      bit more time?

[217470]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CC:  Okay, Jim. We'd like to get a suggested time
     from you. We can figure out a free-return
     maneuver for any time you want to give us, so
     if you'll give us the time you'd like to shoot
     for, we'll figure out a pad.

[217487]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CDR: Okay, that sounds good. I think if we have a
      little bit more time; we want to do it right.
      Stand by 1.

[217504]
_page : 216
_tape : 41/1
CDR: Let's shoot for an hour if we can, Jack. How's
      that.
      

[217515]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CC:  Okay, Jim. How about 61 hours and 30 minutes?
     That's an hour and 5 from now.

[217524]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CDR: Okay. We'll do it and we want to be sure we talk
      back and forth now to make sure we get this burn
      off right.

[217531]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CC:  Affirm.

[217535]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
LMP: Okay, in the interim, Jack, I looked around again
      and I saw that we have a radar and a landing-
      radar heater breaker in. Can I pull those out?

[217546]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CC:  Affirmative. Pull them both out.

[217552]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CC:  And now we want to ask you a question about
     alinements, and so forth. We wanted to know if
     you can see any stars out of the AOT. We also
     wanted to know if you could use the service
     module to cast a shadow on the LM windows and
     then look out the windows to see stars for a
     PS1 COAS alinement.

[217574]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CDR: Okay, in this attitude, Jack, that we're pitching
      around, I cannot use the AOT to see stars. We -
      we're just not able to see them at all. Now we
      may be able to maneuver off in yaw or - and/or
      roll and see stars. Right now, we haven't been
      able to. The AOT is useless. The command module
      structure is just radiating too much light into
      the - into the telescope.

[217601]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CC:  Okay, and how about using the service module to
     cast a shadow on the commander's window? If you
     do that, can you see stars for a COAS alinement?

[217615]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
CDR: We could give that a try, Jack, although I don't
      know how successful it will be. We tried to do
      it - The light shines off our quads which makes
      it difficult to see stars. We do have the Earth
      and the Moon, if that can be of assistance.

[217638]
_page : 217
_tape : 41/2
LMP: Another problem - Right now, Jack, I'm looking
      out the right window and it's pretty dark out
      that window but there are about a thousand or
      so false stars out here from - left over from
      some of the debris. It's hard to discern what's
      real and not real.
      

[217658]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. That's good information and during the
     time that we see you're continuing to pitch, if
     you ever get in a position where you think the
     AOT might be of some use, we'd like you to
     periodically look out of it and see if you can
     see some stars that would enable us to get a P52.

[217679]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, will do. And also, let me ask you a ques-
      tion. In this configuration, docked, we have to
      use the TTCA to control pitch and roll. And,
      just how much can we use that without really
      changing our trajectory? We only have 60 miles
      to play with.

[217701]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, we'll put that to them.

[217725]
_page : 218
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, Jack, are you ready to go to work with me
      on the 2-hour DPS activation and contingency
      book, page 1?

[217734]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, we're ready to go.

[217745]
_page : 218
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Item one, we can - one through five, we
      can scratch off, as done. Is that correct?

[217754]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CC:  Stand by 1, Fred.

[217818]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Fred, let's go ahead. Step 1, page 1.
     Everybody's listening.

[217828]
_page : 218
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, I've looked around, and I've essentially
      done steps 1 through 5 with the exception of
      floodlights and utility lights and I think we'll
      just do without those.

[217840]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. Your choice.

[217847]
_page : 218
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, on EPS activation, we're through step -
      we're through that - bottom of that page. That's
      all done.

[217858]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CC:  We concur, page 2.

[217873]
_page : 218
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, in essence, we've circumvented step 4, and
      we're not sitting with all 4 aps - descent BATs
      on high-voltage taps, so I'll scratch off step 4.

[217888]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, and in step 5, we want to leave INVERTER 1
     circuit breaker OPEN.
     

[217897]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
LMP: Roger. In step 5, we'll leave INVERTER 1 CB
      OPEN.

[217901]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
CC:  Omit step 6.

[217913]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
LMP: Okay, for the time being, our mission timer is
      the computer so, mission timer activation scratch
      off.

[217925]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
CC:  Roger.

[217929]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
LMP: Okay. We've done the primary glycol loop
      activation.

[217935]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
CC:  We verify it.

[217949]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
CC:  Aquarius, we recommend you leave the caution and
     warning off on page 3.

[217957]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
LMP: Okay. I was going to say that next. Page 3,
      we'll just scratch item 1. And item 2, I've
      already got the RCS heaters on. And I don't
      know if I gave you the time or you got the time
      on the PRIMARY EVAP FLOW number 1, OPEN.

[217984]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
CC:  We got the time.

[217990]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
LMP: Okay. Let's go to the CB pages now.

[218009]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
CC:  Fred-o, did you close the engine control breaker
     in panel 11?

[218018]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
LMP: What control is that, Jack?

[218020]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
CC:  Did you close the S and C engine control breaker
     on panel 11? As we got step 1 there on page 3.

[218029]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
LMP: Okay. Okay, yes, the EPS DESCENT ECA CONTROL
      breaker is CLOSED on 11.

[218040]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
CC:  Roger, and how about the - on panel 11, S and C
     ENGINE CONTROL, CLOSED? AFT OMNI, Fred.

[218056]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
LMP: Okay. We're AFT OMNI, and we have the S and C
      ENGINE CONTROL breaker CLOSED.

[218064]
_page : 219
_tape : 41/4
CC:  Roger. Let's go on with the circuit breaker
     panel checkout.
     

[218074]
_page : 220
_tape : 41/5
LMP: Okay. I'll just give you - I think it'll be
      easier to give you what I got in. Okay, in the
      top row on 11, we have the four AC BUS TIE
      breakers IN and the AC BUS VOLTS breaker IN,
      and that's it. Second row, we have the four TCA
      breakers IN. We have the GASTA under FLIGHT
      DISPLAYS and COMMANDER's FDAI. And likewise under
      AC BUS A, we have a GASTA and a COMMANDER FDAI
      breaker IN. That's it. On row 3, we have a
      SIGNAL CONDITIONER 1. We have the ATCA (PGNS).
      We have the ENGINE CONTROL breaker, ATTITUDE
      DIRECT CONTROL breaker, and the - under LIGHTING,
      ANUN/DOCK/COMPONENT breaker IN. And one other,
      ED LOGIC POWER A - ED LOGIC POWER A is also IN.

[218141]
_page : 220
_tape : 41/5
CC:  Copy.

[218145]
_page : 220
_tape : 41/5
LMP: Okay, under the fourth - fourth row, we got all
      the QUAD HEATER breakers IN, SUIT FAN 1. Under
      ECS, GLYCOL 1 and 2; and under COMM, we have
      COMMANDER AUDIO IN, and PGNSs LGC/DSKY, IMU
      STANDBY, IMU OPERATE, and that's it. Okay, in
      the bottom row, EPS, we have the BAT FEED TIE
      both IN, and we have the CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS
      IN, the X LUNAR BUS TIE, DESCENT ECA CONTROL,
      DESCENT ECA, and the DC BUS VOLTs breaker.

[218198]
_page : 220
_tape : 41/5
CC:  Roger. We copy. - -

[218199]
_page : 220
_tape : 41/5
CMP: That completes it for panel 11. Okay. Stand by.
      Okay.

[218214]
_page : 220
_tape : 41/5
LMP: As I see it, some of the short ones are - we need
      the DECA GIMBAL in sooner or later.

[218220]
_page : 220
_tape : 41/5
CC:  That's affirmed. Close the DECA GIMBAL.

[218221]
_page : 220
_tape : 41/5
LMP: And probably - Okay, DECA GIMBAL, and sooner or
      later, we're going to need DECA POWER, I guess,
      also.

[218235]
_page : 220
_tape : 41/5
CC:  All right, DECA POWER will come up later in the
     procedure, Fred-o.

[218241]
_page : 220
_tape : 41/5
LMP: Okay.

[218321]
_page : 220
_tape : 41/5
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. On your circuit breaker
     checklist, on panel 11 and 16, we want you to
     configure the panels as outlined in the checklist.
     

[218337]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
LMP: Okay. You want us to configure as per checklist.
      Okay. We'll do that.

[218343]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CC:  That's right. Close the black ones and open the
     white ones.

[218352]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
LMP: Yes. I think we can manage that.

[218359]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CDR: With the activation power up, we're starting
      right now.

[218412]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CDR: Houston, we might as well leave our RCS TCAs IN,
      right?

[218423]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CC:  Affirmative, Jim. Leave your RCS TCAs in - -

[218426]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
LMP: Check that - -

[218427]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CC:  - - on panel 11.

[218430]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
LMP: - - Yes. I used my Pentel pen and made those
      white ones black ones.

[218435]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CC:  Roger. Same on 16, Fred.

[218440]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
LMP: Roger.

[218446]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CDR: And you might look there, Houston, to see what
      circuit breakers aren't required, like the tape
      recorder.

[218452]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CC:  We're looking.

[218501]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CC:  Okay, Jim. On panel 11 over there, you can also
     leave open the RENDEZVOUS HEATER breaker and the
     LANDING RADAR HEATER breaker, in addition to the
     tape recorder.

[218515]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CDR: They're out.

[218524]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
LMP: I'm leaving a few in, Jack, too, like the SUIT
      FAN 1 is still IN, RCS SYSTEM is still IN, the
      TCAs. ATTITUDE DIRECT CONTROL is IN.

[218538]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CC:  Roger.

[218553]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CDR: How about if I leave the VHF A and B OFF?

[218561]
_page : 221
_tape : 41/6
CC:  Switch to FORWARD OMNI.
     

[218573]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
CC:  Okay. We can leave the VHF powered down, too.

[218581]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
CDR: And, do you want the SECONDARY S-BAND?

[218584]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
CC:  Negative on SECONDARY S-BAND. Leave them open.

[218593]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
CDR: UP DATA LINK is IN. Do you want that in or out?

[218601]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
CC:  Leave the UP DATA LINK open. We'll call for it
     when we want you to put it in.

[218676]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
LMP: Okay, Jack, on panel 11 on the top row, do you
      really want the PROPULSION PQGS and ASCENT HELIUM
      REGs in?

[218694]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
LMP: And, also the SYSTEM ENGINEER X- POINTER breaker.

[218699]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
CC:  Roger. Negative on the PQGS. Negative on the
     ASCENT HELIUM REG, and negative on the CROSS-
     POINTER.

[218717]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
LMP: Okay. On the second row, I'm going to leave the
      FLOODLIGHT breaker open.

[218724]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
CC:  Concur.

[218731]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
LMP: And we're again up to - Do you want the CWEA
      enabled?

[218739]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
CC:  Negative on the CWEA.

[218744]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
LMP: Okay.

[218762]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
LMP: Okay. Since we're - are we going to power up
      the AGS or should I concern myself with the ATCA
      breaker?

[218774]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
CC:  Negative on the AGS. However, Fred, we need the
     ATCA breaker in.

[218788]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
LMP: Okay. ATCA breakers IN. Yes. I guess for the
      backup power supply. Hey, how about ATCA AGS.

[218803]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
CC:  Negative on ATCA AGS.

[218825]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
LMP: And I'm leaving the SUIT FLOW CONTROL breaker
      open.

[218840]
_page : 222
_tape : 41/7
CC:  Let's close the SUIT FLOW CONTROL breaker - -
     

[218842]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CDR: And, now ...

[218843]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CC:  - - so it doesn't take any current.

[218850]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
LMP: Okay. Without suits, it doesn't do us much good
      either though.

[218872]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
LMP: Okay. And are we going to continue to be able
      to operate off the OMNIs, Jack. So can I leave
      the S-band antenna powered down?

[218898]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CC:  Okay, Fred-o. We don't plan to use the steerable
     antenna, although we want to leave the heaters on.
     So it looks you ought to open up COMM S-BAND
     ANTENNA, but leave S-BAND ANTENNA HEATERS closed.

[218913]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
LMP: Roger. COMM S-BAND is OPEN, S-BAND HEATER breaker
      is still CLOSED.

[218966]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
LMP: And, on the bottom row, Jack, I'm going to leave
      the HEATER DISPLAY breaker out, which we had
      pulled before, and EPS DISPLAY. But I question,
      do we want the ASCENT ECA breaker in, as
      prescribed?

[218987]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CC:  Stand by. That's a negative on the ASCENT ECA
     breaker. Leave it open.

[219002]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CC:  And, Aquarius, we need P00 and DATA - -

[219004]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CDR: And that's a - -

[219005]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CC:  - - and we'll give you state vector and target
     load.

[219012]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
LMP: Okay. We need the UP LINK breaker in then now.

[219017]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CC:  That's affirmative.

[219023]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CDR: Okay. And, Jack, will you give us that - how
      about the ORDEAL breaker? Can I pull that?
      We don't need that, do we?

[219032]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CC: Negative on the ORDEAL. Leave it open.

[219048]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
LMP: And how about the ASCENT ECA breaker on panel 11?
      Jim has it in over there.

[219062]
_page : 223
_tape : 41/8
CC:  And panel 11 ASCENT ECA can be open.
     

[219067]
_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
CDR: It's open.

[219087]
_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're GO on the circuit breaker
     configuration as you have it now.

[219096]
_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
SC:  Roger.

[219124]
_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
CC:  And, Aquarius, tests in the simulator just showed
     that if you want to let the PGNS DAP hold your
     attitude for you, it will.

[219136]
_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
CDR: Okay, very well.

[219150]
_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
CDR: And, Jack, because it will take quite a while to
      get back to the attitude, I think we ought to
      think about going there very shortly.

[219157]
_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
CC:  Roger. I have a pad for you. I have a P30
     maneuver pad.

_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
LMP: Go right ahead, Jack.

[219178]
_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
CC:  Okay. We want you to hold your maneuver until
     we finish making the load. We haven't completed
     it yet. Are you ready to copy P30 maneuver pad?

[219187]
_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
CDR: That's affirm.

[219189]
_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
CC:  Okay. Here we go. The purpose is midcourse
     correction for free return. NOUN 33: 061:29:42.84;
     minus 0021.3, plus 0004.1, minus 0031.2; HA and
     HP are NA; DELTA-V 0038.0; 031, 120, 298,
     minus 00213, plus 00041, minus 00312; COAS NA.
     And I have your LM GDA angles. Pitch 5.86,
     roll 6.75. Your DPS throttling, 5 seconds at
     10 percent, burn the rest at 40 percent. Your
     ullage will be two jets for 10 seconds.

[219297]
_page : 224
_tape : 41/9
LMP: Okay, Jack, we have a P30 maneuver pad, a mid-
      course for free return. NOUN 33: 061:29:42.84;
      minus 0021.3, plus 004.1, minus 0031.2; HA and
      HP N/A; DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> 0038.0; 031, 120, 298;

      GDA angles; pitch 5.86, roll 6.75; DPS throttle
      5 seconds at 10 percent; burn the rest at 40 per-
      cent. And we need a two-Jet, 10-second ullage.
      

[219362]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
CC:  That's a good readback, Fred. I'd like to verify,
     however, in NOUN 81, in V<sub>Y</sub>, it's plus three balls
     41.

[219374]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
LMP: Okay. NOUN 81, V<sub>Y</sub> is plus 0004.1.

[219381]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
CC:  Good readback. Let's press on with the checklist.

[219387]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
CDR: Okay. And, Jack, find out about using TTCA to
      maneuver with.

[219392]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
CC:  Okay. We're finished with the computer, it's
     yours, and we recommend using the TTCA to
     maneuver with.

[219401]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
CDR: Roger.

[219403]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
LMP: Okay, I'm back on the checklist, page 6. Jack,
      under PGNS turn-on and self-test. We've done
      everything except the self test here on this
      page. Do you want to do that at this time?

[219448]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
CC:  Okay. Aquarius, negative on the PGNS self test.

[219457]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
LMP: Okay. I'll scratch page 6 and on page 7, we're
      not going to activate the - or rather we had the
      S-band activated, ECS Activation I have all done.
      And, at the bottom of the page, the docked IMU
      coarse aline is done.

[219483]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
CC:  Roger.

[219494]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
LMP: We've - Okay, we've also completed, I guess in
      essence, all of page 8.

[219502]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
CC:  That's affirmative and page 9 to boot. Scratch
     VHF. We've done the T<sub>ephems</sub>.

[219516]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
LMP: Okay. You've updated it, that's right. We
      cranked in the time.

[219532]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
CDR: And, Houston, let's go to activation - or get
      into page 10 and see what we did there.

[219538]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
CC:  Okay. The only item on page 10 is to deploy the
     landing gear.

[219546]
_page : 225
_tape : 41/10
CDR: Okay, we'll do that now.
      

[219610]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
LMP: Okay. The landing gear are down and locked,
      Jack, and looking ahead now at page 11, we've
      done all of that.

[219624]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
CC:  We verify that. Page 12.

[219631]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
LMP: Okay, and I assume in amongst all those numbers
      you pumped up, we got a REFSMMAT and STATE
      VECTOR, is that correct?

[219639]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
CC:  That's affirmative. You've got that. So you
     can delete page 12.

[219652]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
LMP: Hey, on 13, you've read us up the fine aline
      angles and we've cranked those in.

[219661]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
CC:  Affirmative.

[219668]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
LMP: Okay, so now we're up to - we've got to do DAP
      set, the gimbal/throttle test.

[219673]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
CC:  That's - Okay, Aquarius. We recommend omitting
     the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test - Just make
     sure the gim - DECA POWER and DECA GIMBAL cir-
     cuit breakers are closed.

[219693]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
LMP: Okay, we're going to proceed now with the DAP
      set, gimbal/throttle test, is that correct? Or
      did you say delete it?

[219700]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
CC:  Aquarius, delete the DAP set, gimbal/throttle
     test. Just ensure that the DECA POWER and the
     DECA GIMBAL are closed.

[219709]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
CDR: Okay. Houston, DECA POWER is OPEN at this time.
      Do you want me to close it?

[219714]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
CC:  Affirmative, Jim. Close the DECA POWER.

[219720]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
CDR: It's CLOSED. We deleted that.

[219747]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
LMP: Okay. Also out of that list, Jack, we need the
      COMMANDER's THROTTLE set to THROTTLE and MIN.

[219778]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
LMP: Houston, if I recall the launch set of the
      gimbals, the GDAs are not correct here, and where
      are we going to get those set for the burn?

[219794]
_page : 226
_tape : 41/11
CC:  Stand by 1.
     

[219813]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
CC:  Okay. Here's the word on the DAP set, gimbal/
     throttle test. Let's do step 1 and step 2, and
     that'll get our gimbal set.

[219830]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
LMP: Roger.

[219860]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
LMP: Okay, Jack, we're going to have to back up on
      this, if we're going to follow the procedure here,
      which has us go MODE CONTROL; PGNS, AUTO, we're
      going to have to pull the TCA breakers to keep
      from firing jets.

[219893]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
CC:  Stand by, Fred.

[219928]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
CC:  Stand by on step 1, Fred. We're getting the
     word for you. How do you like this SIM?

[219942]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
CDR: It's a beauty.

[219969]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
CC:  Okay, Aquarius, we recommend you do the DAP set
     and gimbal/throttle test as per the checklist.
     Go PGNS AUTO and proceed.

[219981]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
CDR: Well, we're going to fire our thrusters as soon
      as we go to AUTO because we've got those thrusters
      in - the thruster circuit breakers. Do you want
      us to do that and stop?

[220010]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
CC:  Okay, Aquarius, we're recommending you go to
     AUTO. Let the thrusters fire and settle down
     and proceed with the test.

[220026]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
CDR: We're in PGNS AUTO.

[220029]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
CC:  Roger, your DAP is set, you're in wide deadband.
     That ought to do the trick.

[220035]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
CDR: Roger.

[220039]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
CC:  Okay, we're looking at it, Aquarius. We're
     ready to proceed with the test.

[220046]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
LMP: Okay, we're proceeding.

[220072]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
LMP: Okay, and Houston, you - you're looking at the
      weights now. Those are still good, right?

[220081]
_page : 227
_tape : 41/12
CC:  You're GO on the weights.
     

[220145]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to recycle on
     the DAP load and change your DAP to 32021. Over.

[220265]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're looking at your gimbal
     and we notice that we got a four-jet ullage
     loaded in the DAP and we gave you two jets on
     the pad. But, let's go with what we've got loaded.
     It'll be a four-jet ullage.

[220278]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
LMP: Okay.

[220300]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
LMP: Okay, Houston. How does the GDAs look now?

[220305]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  The GDAs are GO as they are. Press on.

[220329]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CDR: Okay, Houston, we're going to do the DPS
      pressurization and checkout.

[220336]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Stand by 1.

[220354]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Okay, your gimbals are within 0.3 and we're ready
     for the DPS pressurization and checkout.

[220413]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
LMP: Okay, Houston, do you want to follow up on
      page 15 with RCS checkout? In essence, we've
      kind of already done that.

[220427]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  You're right, Aquarius. Let's delete the RCS
     checkout. And a DPS looks GO.

[220543]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CDR: Houston, we're going to do a PGNS AUTO maneuver
      to the attitude.

[220549]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Stand by on that. Aquarius, we recommend
     driving it around there manually with a TTCA.

[220558]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CDR: Okay, we'll have to use the TTCA. Roger.

[220870]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CDR: We're going to AUTO now, Houston, to try to damp
      the rates. We're at the attitude.

[220882]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Roger, Jim. We verify the attitude.

[220887]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CDR: Roger.

[221017]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
LMP: And, Houston, we'd like to confirm, do you
      want the VERB 65 ENTER in there?

[221025]
_page : 228
_tape : 41/13
CC:  Affirmative on the VERB 65.
     

[221029]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Okay.

[221052]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Okay, Jack. I got another question on page 18.
      At 1 minute, I concur with MASTER ARM ON, but
      I wonder why I have to have the ABORT STAGE
      breaker in. We sure don't want any staging now.

[221078]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  Aquarius, delete the ABORT STAGE circuit breaker
     CLOSE. Leave it open.

[221086]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Roger. Will delete.

[221095]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Okay. Also, Jack, since we have four-jet ullage
      versus two, do you want - still want 10 seconds
      ullage or do you want 5 now?

[221109]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  Okay, Aquarius, we'll use automatic ullage.

[221118]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Okay. We'll just let the 7-1/2-second AUTO
      ullage do it.

[221123]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  Roger, and we'd like to do this in manual throttle,
     so on page 17 about two-thirds of the way down,
     THROTTLE CONTROL, MANUAL, vice AUTO.

[221135]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Okay. We're set to MANUAL.

[221158]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CDR: What's the 203 ... ?

[221165]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  ENTER on the 203, Jim.

[221171]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CDR: We've got 203 in the DSKY now and it looks as
      though it requires work, can we pass it?

[221176]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  Aquarius, ENTER on the 203.

[221182]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CDR: Wait a minute.

[221211]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  Aquarius, we'd like to verify that your throttle
     is in the MIN position.

[221218]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CDR: That's affirm.

[221220]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CC:  And, in the event that you have to do a manual
     takeover, turn the ENGINE GIMBAL OFF, MODE CONTROL
     to ATTITUDE HOLD, and use the hand - use the TTCA.

[221236]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
CDR: Roger.

[221294]
_page : 229
_tape : 41/14
LMP: Okay, 1 plus 30 to burn.
      

[221300]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Roger.

[221325]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
LMP: Okay, MASTER ARM's ON; 1 minute.

[221333]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Roger, Aquarius. You're GO for the burn.

[221395]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CDR: 40 percent.

[221404]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. You're looking good.

[221425]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CDR: AUTO shutdown.

[221440]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
LMP: Okay. You're looking at 1685 now, Jack.

[221446]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Okay. You're GO in the residuals, proceed.

[221455]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
LMP: Okay. When you say GO on the residuals, you
      mean don't trim them. Is that right?

[221460]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  That's affirmative. No trim required.

[221466]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CDR: Roger.

[221468]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
LMP: Okay.

[221537]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Aquarius, check your MASTER ARM OFF, please.

[221564]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CDR: Okay, Houston. Burn's complete. Now we have to
      talk about powerdown, and what do you want us to
      do with the PGNS?

[221572]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Roger. We're looking at that right now, and
     you'll be the first one to get the word.

[221599]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CDR: And, Houston, it's doubtful right now whether
      we'll be able to see the stars in this configura-
      tion. The only way we could possibly get aline-
      ment is with the Earth and the terminator or the
      Moon and its terminator and I'd sure like to
      have you look at a powerdown - keeping the PGNS
      if at all possible.

[221629]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Roger, Jim. We'll get the word for you.

[221724]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CDR: And, Houston, we're in an ATT HOLD mode, can we
      turn off the buses?

[221740]
_page : 230
_tape : 41/15
CC:  Stand by on that one, Jim.
     

[221893]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're working on what's going
     to happen next. In the meantime, we'd like to
     take some high-power items off the line, so on
     panel 11, open DECA POWER, and open DECA GIMBAL.
     On 16, open the ATCA breaker.

[221916]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
LMP: Okay, on 11, we got DECA POWER, DECA GIMBAL, OPEN.
      On 16, we got the ATCA breaker OPEN.

[221977]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CDR: And, Houston, while you're thinking, see if you
      can come up with a procedure of perhaps using
      the command module optics with manual drive to
      perhaps look for stars.

[221991]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CC:  Roger.

[222084]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CDR: And, Jack, Aquarius. While you're thinking -
      before we had our COMM problems, we were wanting
      to know what to - whether we should hook up the
      side hatch urine dump system. So we wouldn't
      freeze up the normal urine dump system.

[222105]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CC:  Roger. We gave you a GO on that earlier. Sorry,
     you must have missed it. Use the side hatch for
     urine dump.

[222114]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CDR: Okay.

[222116]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CC:  And, how are the stars out the window now?

[222133]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CDR: Well, I'll look again, Jack, but at this attitude,
      the Sun is reflecting off of - off of quad 4 so
      bright that it's ruining any night vision and
      we still got particles floating around us; I'll
      have to take a long look and see if I can see
      any star patterns.

[222154]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CC:  Roger. And Aquarius, we're going to have to hand
     you over to a different site now, and we think
     maybe things will work better if this time we
     turn off the S-band transmitter/receiver, and
     bring it back up in 5 minutes. You copy?

[222179]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CDR: Okay. Stand by 1.

[222190]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CDR: Okay. I understand you want us to turn off the
      S-band transmitter/receiver and bring it up in
      5 minutes. Is that correct?

[222195]
_page : 231
_tape : 41/16
CC:  That's affirmative.
     

[222200]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
CDR: Tell us when.

[222222]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
CDR: And you want us to maintain attitude control.

[222226]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17

      tain auto attitude control.

[222236]

_tape : 41/17
LMP: Okay, Jack, I'm back on the line now. On the
      S-band, you want me to turn off the transmitter/
      receiver and the power amps are off for 5 minutes.
      Is that - when you give me the word - is that
      what you want?

[222250]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
CC:  Aquarius, leave the power amplifier the way it
     is. Turn the transmitter/receiver off for
     5 minutes. Now.

[222259]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
LMP: Okay. You tell me - you tell me when.

[222262]
_page : 232
_tape : 41/17
CC:  Okay. Turn it off now. See you in 5 minutes.

[222266]
_page : 232

_tape : 42/1
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

[222772]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
LMP: Okay. You're loud and clear there, Jack.

[222774]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
CC:  Roger. Same here. We're - We're still discussing
     the next move.

[222784]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
LMP: I figured it. Let's just make it a good one.

[222798]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
CC:  We're looking real close at water usage profiles,
     and right now things are kind of swinging toward
     leaving the IMU powered up and powering down the
     LGC, but we'll have more word for you shortly.
     And we recommend for sleeping that you leave one
     guy on watch. We recommend you don't make any
     urine dumps if you can help it, because it'll
     make the debris problem worse than it is now.
     And we have some items that you might want to
     transfer to the LM, some towels, some penlights,
     fecal bags, UTS. And do you have any more items
     that we can help you out with at the moment?

[222857]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
LMP: Okay. Stand by on your latter list there, Jack.
      I understand no urine dumps. I guess we'll work
      through the UCD and all the bags we got; and
      real quick there, can you give a DAP load that
      we want in here now to conserve the RCS.

[222921]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
CC:  Okay. For attitude control coordinates, we're
     recommending manual control VERB 76 and watch
     your middle gimbal angle. Your DAP load that you
     have now looks good.

[222937]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
LMP: Okay. It's ATT HOLD VERB 76 for the guy on
      watch. And the DAP load we got right now is okay.

[223097]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
CC:  Aquarius, our decision for the time is to leave
     the IMU powered up, power down the LGC, and power
     down other nonessential items. We'll be coming
     up with a more precise checklist as soon as we
     can get it. Over.

[223116]
_page : 233
_tape : 42/1
LMP: Okay. The decision is to keep the platform,
      power down the computer, and we'll be standing
      by for further word on the powerdown, Jack.

[223127]

[223173]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CC:  And, Aquarius, for your information, we now have
     136-mile perigee. Confirmed by Doppler.

[223187]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
LMP: Okay. 136-mile perigee now. That's very nice.

[223209]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
LMP: Oh, wait a minute, Jack. Did you say pericynthion
      or perigee?

[223213]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CC:  I meant pericynthion.

[223218]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
LMP: Ah. That's better.

[223519]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CDR: And, Houston, we pulled out your UPDATA LINK
      circuit breaker, so if you want to update it for
      anything, let us know and we'll put it back in.

[223527]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CC:  Roger, Jim. We will.

[223781]

_tape : 42/2
LMP: Houston, do you read Apollo 13?

[224070]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CC:  This is Houston. Go ahead. Reading you weakly.

[224076]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CDR: Okay, Jack. We don't want to bug you, but you
      ought to be thinking - or what your thoughts are
      concerning what the next burn will be. I got to
      figure out a watch schedule and the sleep schedule
      and Just how we can meet the next maneuver.

[224095]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CC:  Roger. We're getting you a flight plan update.
     We're still computing on your next burn, and we're
     getting ready to give you a procedure for
     powerdown.

[224194]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CC:  Aquarius, one idea on managing the OMNI antennas.
     It might make it easier on everybody if we disabled
     the UPLINK SQUELCH and managed the antennas by
     switching when we hear the noise. Over.

[224218]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CDR: Roger. Will do.

[224767]
_page : 234
_tape : 42/2
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. Here's what we're going to do.
     We'd like you to point the LM X-axis either north
     or south. That's the positive X-axis. It appears
     to us that it would be closer to orient the LM
     plus X-axis toward the south. Do that with the
     LGC powered up using the TTCA. After that, we
     
     propose to power down the LGC to save some power.
     However, this means that we lose the use of the
     TTCA, and we'll have to control the spacecraft
     with the hand controller in the DIRECT mode.
     Request your - your position on these two items.

[224854]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

[224865]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CDR: Okay, Jack. Understand. You want us to point
      the LM X - plus X-axis to the south using the
      TTCAs with the LGC powered up. Then, by powering
      down the LGC, we'll lose a TTCA. I wasn't too
      successful in controlling the spacecraft in at-
      titude only, but I might be able to keep it out
      of gimbal lock.

[224894]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. We'd keep your ball
     powered up and go to DIRECT on the hand controller.
     And maintain attitude in a DIRECT position.

[224919]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CDR: Okay. Understand; and do you want some sort of
      a PTC mode, Jack?

[224927]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  Affirmative. We'll take whatever PTC mode you
     can set up, Jim.

[224934]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CDR: Okay. And since you know our approximate attitude,
      how about Just getting me something to find you
      on the DSKY for a southerly plus X-direction.

[224944]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  Roger. Stand by 1.

[225035]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CDR: And one other question, Houston. When you say
      power down the DSKY or the LGC, do you mean going
      into 06 or multiple circuit breaker?

[225048]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  Stand by on powering down the DSKY, Jim. We'll
     give you the procedure for that. The procedure
     that we - -

[225057]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CDR: Okay.

[225058]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  - - the procedure that we have is listed in several
     places. It's in the Contingency checklist under
     "Power down" on page 1, second paragraph.

[225081]
_page : 235
_tape : 42/3
CC:  And we'll give you that word when we want you to
     do that. That's LGC only, not to power down the
     IMU. But we'd like to have you hold off on that
     until we send you the word. Over.
     

[225098]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
CDR: Understand.

[225237]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
CC:  And, Aquarius, while we're working on this, we
     have a proposed flight plan update for your work-
     ing and resting cycles. And - You ready to copy?

[225254]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
LMP: Okay. Do you want me to write this in the flight
      plan, per se, Jack?

[225259]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
CC:  You can probably write it on a piece of scratch
     paper. This is pretty easy.

[225271]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
LMP: Okay. Go ahead. We got a lot of scratch paper.

[225279]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
CC:  Okay. We're suggesting that the LMP rest while
     the CMP and CDR are awake. LMP ought to hit the
     sack at about 63 hours, coming up in 25 minutes.
     And you get to rest for 6 hours. You get up at
     69 hours. At 70 hours, the commander and the
     command module pilot sleep for 6 hours until
     76 hours. Around 70 - 76-1/2 to 77 hours, we'll
     do a P51 and a 52. At 78:30, we'll load P30 and
     aline AGS to PGNS. Our ignition time for a second
     burn will be, presently, 79:25:26.5, and we'll
     have a pad for you shortly. We suggest that all
     of you eat after the burn. That'll be 81 to
     82 hours. Let the CMP and CDR eat while you are
     sleeping. And that you grab a bite as soon as
     you can. Over.

[225425]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
LMP: Okay, Jack. As I read that, the LMP is to go to
      sleep at 63:00 for about 6 hours. During that
      period, the CDR and CMP should try to get a bite
      to eat. I'm to awake at 69 hours. CDR and CMP
      sleep at 70 hours, and they are to awake at
      76 hours. And we should plan on doing our P51,
      P52 at 76 hours or 76:30. At 78:30, we're going
      to load a P30 and aline AGS to PGNS. Second
      maneuver is to take place at 79:25:26.5 for
      ignition time. Then we're all to eat at 81 to
      82 hours.

[225485]
_page : 236
_tape : 42/4
CC:  Okay. With a minor modification, your P51, P52
     will be about 77 hours, and that's the period of
     darkness. And the commander and the CMP ought to
     eat around 68 to 69 hours, and you should eat
     between 69 to 70 hours just after you get up. We
     have left an hour in there where everybody is
     awake together to talk things over. Go ahead.
     

[225524]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
LMP: Okay. I'll eat after I wake up between 69 and 70.

[225533]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CC:  All right we have additional - -

[225535]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
LMP: - - and I've got the correction to P - -

[225539]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CC:  Go ahead, Fred.

[225540]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
LMP: Yes. We got the word the P51, P52 is going to be
      done around 77 hours, while we're in darkness.

[225551]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CC:  That's affirmative. And we have a work-rest cycle
     laid out for further on, which we can relay to you
     later.

[225562]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
LMP: Okay.

[225580]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CDR: Okay. And, Houston, you have advice on what
      attitude you want me to go to.

[225590]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CC:  Okay. That'll be the next bit of information.
     I'll get that for you, Jim.

[225596]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CDR: Okay.

[225703]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CC:  And, Aquarius, just to get you thinking in that
     direction, we've run a fairly thorough analysis,
     and we've found out that it's going to be cheaper
     to keep the LGC and the DSKY up and turn the
     inverter and the ball off. It's going to save us
     1 amp and also some water, so it looks like what
     we're going to do. And we'll have to monitor the
     middle gimbal angle. And we'll get the procedure
     on that, and it'll also be an easier control mode
     where we'll be able to use the TTCA through the -
     through the DAP.

[225737]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CDR: That sounds great, Jack.

[226048]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We've got a procedure for you.
     Ready to copy?

[226060]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CDR: Ready to copy.

[226062]
_page : 237
_tape : 42/5
CC:  Okay. It's pretty easy. We see you've already
     got VERB 16 NOUN 20 called up there and so we
     want you to, in maneuver and PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD,
     use the TTCA. We want you to, on the commander's
     ball, pitch to 267.5 and yaw to minus 4.5. And
     when you do this in VERB 16 NOUN 20, on the DSKY,
     you ought to read plus 00120, plus 26750, and
     plus 00450. Go ahead.
     

[226114]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
LMP: Okay. We're to drive the commander's ball to a
      pitch of 267.5, yaw minus 4.5. And we should have
      in 16 20 at that time, plus 00120, plus 26750,
      plus 00450.

[226136]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CC:  That's a good readback. We'll watch the maneuver.

[226585]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[226587]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[226591]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CDR: Roger. You didn't mention roll on the ball. Do
      you want roll zero?

[226602]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CC:  The roll ought to be plus 1.2, Jim.

[226609]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CDR: Roger.

[227021]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[227024]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[227028]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CDR: Okay. We're just about there in pitch and in ...
      middle gimbal angle, but that other gimbal angle
      didn't look like it pulled the right way. I
      tried both methods.

[227042]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CC:  Yes. I been looking at that, too, and we're ask-
     ing why, and we'll get an answer for you.

[227060]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
LMP: Yes. Houston, I wonder if you're accounting for
      being a bit off the bellyband here, and I've gone
      through GASTA.

[227078]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CC:  And, Fred-o, I know you're supposed to start
     sleeping here pretty soon, but we got a new PC
     plus 2 pad, P30 maneuver pad for you.

[227096]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CDR: Stand by.

[227132]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
LMP: Okay. Go ahead, Jack.

[227135]
_page : 238
_tape : 42/6
CC:  Okay, Fred. P30 maneuver purpose is PC plus 2,
     DPS to this time, we're going to the MPL. And
     NOUN 33, 079, 27, 4013, plus 08144, minus 00443,
     minus 02226, apogee is N/A, perigee is plus 00205,
     08455, 420, 268, 261, plus 08155, minus 00443,
     minus 02187, COAS is N/A. Your GDA ought to be
     okay as it is from the last burn, but pitch ought
     to be at 5.85; in roll, it's 6.74. Your ullage
     will be two jets for t0 seconds. Your DPS
     
     throttle will be 10 percent for 5 seconds, 40 per-
     cent for 21 seconds, and the remainder at full
     throttle. And for your information, this will
     put you in the water at 142 plus 47. Over.

[227266]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
LMP: Okay. DPS, pericynthion plus 2 into the MPL,
      079, 27, 4013, plus 08144, minus 00443, minus
      00226, N/A, plus 00205, 08455, 4 plus 20, 268,
      261, plus 08155, minus 00443, minus 021, 2187,
      N/A. GDA should be okay as is, which hopefully
      is pitch 5.85, yaw 6.74. Two-jet ullage for
      10 seconds, the DPS throttle 10 percent for
      5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, 100 per-
      cent for the rest of the burn. And this should
      put us into the water at 142 plus 47.

[227343]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
CC:  Okay, Fred. I have a correction in NOUN 81.
     DELTA-V<sub>Z</sub> is minus 02226. Read back.

[227362]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
LMP: Okay. DELTA-V<sub>Z</sub> in NOUN 81 is minus 02226.

[227368]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
CC:  Okay. Good readback.

[227381]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
LMP: Somehow that didn't add up with the DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> to
      give a DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> of that magnitude. It seems like
      it'd been bigger.

[227392]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
CC:  Okay. We'll take another look at it, Fred.

[227549]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
CDR: Okay, Houston. I'm not having too much luck hold-
      ing this particular attitude.

[227562]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
CC:  Okay, Jim. Stand by 1.

[227657]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. When you get her pretty much in
     attitude there, and it looks like you're as close
     as we need to be, we'd like to try a control mode
     and see if it will work; sort of a semi-PTC. We'll
     leave the ball powered up for this, and if this
     doesn't work, why, we'll have to revert to
     ATTITUDE HOLD mode. But - Stand by 1, please.

[227703]
_page : 239
_tape : 42/7
CC:  We'd like you to think about this control mode,
     Jim, and see if you think it might work from
     what you know right now. We're a little skepti-
     cal, but we'd like to put it to you. So, once
     you get in a pretty good attitude, monitor in
     VERB 16 NOUN 20, go to PGNS MINIMUM IMPULSE,
     VERB 76, as we have, and set up a yaw rate - yaw
     rate to the right. Monitor the middle gimbal on
     
     R<sub>3</sub> on the DSKY and see if she'll kind of stabilize
     out. If not, the only other suggestion we've got
     is to go to PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD. We'll keep the
     ball up until you make this evaluation.

[227745]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CDR: Okay, Houston. You cut out, say again.

[227751]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CC:  Okay. Where'd you lose me, Jim?

[227756]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CDR: I lost you when you said try the control mode;
      you're a little skeptical.

[227761]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CC:  Okay. From what you say, we have to be a little
     skeptical of this procedure, but we'd like to
     have you try it and have you evaluate it. You
     can monitor the middle gimbal on R<sub>3</sub>. Before we
     power down the ball, we want your evaluation.
     The next best choice is PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD. Over.

[227784]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CDR: Okay. I'll try it.

[227813]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CDR: Okay. Go ahead with the control mode procedure.

[227850]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CDR: Hello, Houston; Aquarius.

[227853]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[227856]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CDR: Okay. I'm not ... you. I can monitor register 3.
      I can probably keep it out of ... - going into
      gimbal lock.

[227869]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CC:  Roger. How are pitch and roll?

[227920]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CDR: Okay. I think I can control the gimbal angles in
      16 20 with the compressors the way they are, but
      I'll have to try MINIMUM IMPULSE - Just a minute.

[227944]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8
CMP: Okay, Jack. I've a question - one more question
      about Odyssey.

[227948]
_page : 240
_tape : 42/8

     END OF TAPE
     
     

[227954]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CMP: Okay, I still have the PYRO A sequence A and
      PYRO B sequence B circuit breakers in. Do you
      want those out?

[227963]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CC:  Stand by 1.

[227977]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CC:  Odyssey, Houston. The two circuit breakers
     you referred to, leave them in.

[227985]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CMP: Okay. Copy. Leave them in.

[227999]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CDR: Okay, Houston. I can control yaw in minimum
      impulse, but stand by on pitch.

[228017]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CC:  And, Fred-o, the DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> resultant computes
     with the components.

[228029]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CDR: Fred's off the COMM now, Jack.

[228032]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CC:  Roger. Your PAD is good.

[228035]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
LMP: And, Jack, we didn't get that whole sentence
      there.

[228039]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CC:  Okay. I said that the DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> that Fred
     questioned computes well with the component -
     its rms.

[228049]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
LMP: Okay. Copy.

[228054]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CDR: Okay, now. Jack, let's go over this once more.
      You wanted me to try out control of the space-
      craft in the PULSE mode. Is that correct?

[228063]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CC:  That's affirmative. Set up a yaw rate and moni-
     tor the middle gimbal angle.

[228076]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CDR: Okay. I can do that. I'm not too sure whether
      I can control roll or pitch in pulse, but I can
      control yaw in pulse - yaw in pulse on the ball.

[228090]
_page : 241
_tape : 43/1
CC:  Roger. And remember we're not going to have a
     ball there, so that we're going to be monitoring
     CDUs on the DSKY, and if we get it off, it will
     be pretty hard to figure out where to fly back
     to; and, well, in addition, have to control the
     OMNIs while we're doing this.
     

[228112]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: Roger.

[228126]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: Without the ball, I still have use of the TTCA
      for control of the - angles.

[228132]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CC:  Affirmative. You'll have the TTCA for pitch and
     roll.

[228138]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: Okay. I think I can do that without the ball,
      and if you Just give me the TTCAs I think I can
      control the spacecraft using 16 20.

[228151]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: I'm going to yaw right.

[228169]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: Okay, Jack. I am now - The REGISTER 1 is in the
      DECREASE mode.

[228216]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: And, Houston, do you see anything wrong with
      this spacecraft motion?

[228226]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CC:  We have a data drop on right now, Jim; we'll
     look at it as soon as it comes up.

[228292]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're going to dispense with
     this control mode. We'd like you to fly the
     machine back to the original attitude that you
     had, and we'll go PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD, and then
     we've got to get that ball off the line to save
     some power. And then, in order to keep even
     heating, every 15 or 30 minutes, we'll give you
     a call to give us 90 or 180 degrees of roll -
     of yaw.

[228327]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: Okay. You want me to go back to original attitude.
      I'll be going back to it now.

[228516]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I'm flying it back over
      towards the initial angles you gave me of a pitch
      of 257. I'll get near the bellyband in roll and
      yaw; then I'll go to PGNS ATT HOLD.

[228527]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. And then we're going to
     have you go through a powerdown procedure.

[228536]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: Okay.

[228542]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CC:  And you'll need VERB 77 with ATT HOLD when you get
     there.

[228548]
_page : 242
_tape : 43/2
CDR: Will do.
      

[228708]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CDR: Okay, Jack. Have I gotten your 360 on yaw and
      roll? I'm going to go to ATT HOLD.

[228716]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CC:  Roger. And then we want to get the ball part
     down.

[228722]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CDR: Okay. Stand by.

[228772]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CDR: Okay. I'm now in PGNS ATT HOLD. And are you
      reading my DSKY angles?

[228778]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CC:  Roger. We see them.

[228783]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CDR: Now, you want me to power down the ball, and
      if you'll give me the procedure for that, I'll
      do it right away.

[228786]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CC:  Okay. We'll buy what you've got on the DSKY
     there, and we'd just like to go through an
     overall powerdown procedure, and in so doing
     we'll catch the ball and inverter and it will
     only take a few minutes. So are you ready to
     start on panel 11?

[228803]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CDR: Roger. Jack will copy, and I'll do the work.

[228807]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CC:  Okay. Panel 11, top row, open all the circuit
     breakers.

[228815]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CDR: All circuit breakers on top row coming open.

[228828]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CDR: They're all open, top row.

[228830]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CC:  Okay. Second row, close the first six on the
     left through the ISOL VALVE and open all to the
     right of that.

[228847]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CDR: Okay. First six on the left are closed - That's
      through the ISOL VALVE, but I opened up every
      one from there on.

[228853]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CC:  Okay. Third row, open up the next five -
     correction - Open up the first five on the left,
     close AOT HEATER, close SIG CONDITIONER 1.
     Close ATTITUDE DIRECT, and open the rest on row
     three.

[228886]
_page : 243
_tape : 43/3
CDR: Do you want ATCA (PGNS) open?
      

[228893]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CC: Leave ATCA (PGNS) closed; four breakers on the
     third row must be closed. AOT HEATER, SIG CON-
     DITIONER 1, and ATCA (PGNS), ATTITUDE DIRECT
     CONTROL. Our mistake, good going.

[228913]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CDR: Okay. I'm opening up ENGINE START OVERRIDE
      right now. And that row's taken care of.

[228930]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CC:  Okay. On the fourth row. Open - From the left,
     open the first five - correction - Close the
     first five, and open CABIN FAN 1. Close the
     three GLYCOL PUMP circuit breakers; open all the
     COMM breakers, except for COMMANDER'S AUDIO;
     close it. Ail the PGNS breakers, open - correc-
     tion - Open the first three PGNS breakers, close
     LGC/DSKY, IMU STANDBY, IMU OPERATE.

[228983]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CDR: That's complete, Jack.

[228987]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CC:  Okay. And EPS, close BAT FEED TIES, CROSSTIE
     BAL LOAD, and open the CROSS TIE BUS. Close the
     next three; open ASCENT ECA CONTROL, ASCENT ECA,
     and INVERTER 1. Close DC BUS VOLT. Go ahead.

[229022]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CDR: That's complete, Jack. Panel 11 is configured.

[229029]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CC:  Okay. Let's go over to panel 16, top row,
     and starting from the left - Open the first four.

[229047]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CDR: Stand by, Jack.

[229058]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CDR: Okay. Starting from the left, open the first
      four.

[229063]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CC:  Okay. And close the ISOL VALVE, keep your TCA
     breakers closed, close the CROSSFEED, open the
     next two displays. Close the MAIN SOV and the
     PROPULSION breakers should all three be open.

[229088]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CDR: Roger. The main valves are closed, and the
      DISPLAY ENGINE OVERRIDE LOGIC's coming open,
      and the PQGS and ASC He REG are open.

[229098]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CC:  That's affirmative. The second row: they should
     all be open except for three breakers under in-
     strumentation. Close SIG SENSOR, PCM/TE, and
     SIG CONDITIONER 2. Over.

[229121]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CDR: Roger. Do you want SUIT FLOW CONTROL open?

[229137]
_page : 244
_tape : 43/4
CDR: ENGINE ARM coming open and ASA I guess will be
      open. Is that correct?
      

[229141]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CC:  We just got a change on that. Let's keep the
     ASA closed.

[229149]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CDR: How about SUIT FLOW CONTROL and ENGINE ARM?

[229162]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CC:  Okay, Jim. SUIT FLOW CONTROL can be open, and
     ENGINE ARM - ENGINE ARM open.

[229180]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CDR: Okay. Let's go to row 3.

[229184]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CC:  Okay. Row 3 under COMM. Open DISPLAYS, close
     SE AUDIO, open VHF A TRANSMITTER and B RECEIVER,
     close the PRIMARY S-BAND circuit breakers, both
     of them. Open the S-BAND ANTENNA, PMP closed,
     TV open, and all the rest of them open under
     ECS, except CO<sub>2</sub> SENSOR, closed.

[229224]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CDR: Roger.

[229231]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CC:  Okay. Under row 4: under HEATERS, your RCS QUAD
     heaters should - four of them - be closed, open
     DISPLAYS, open S-BAND ANTENNA, open SEQUENCE
     CAMERA. Under EPS, open DISPLAYS, close DC BUS
     VOLT, open INVERTER 2, open ASCENT ECA CONTROL
     and ASCENT ECA, close DESCENT ECA, DESCENT ECA
     CONTROL, TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE, close CROSS TIE BAL
     LOADS, open CROSS TIE BUS, close BAT FEED TIES.
     Over.

[229289]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CDR: That's been completed, Jack.

[229315]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CC:  Okay, Jim. And we've already got a change to
     what we just told you. Under ECS, close the
     CABIN REPRESS, and insure that the ASA BREAKER
     is closed under S and C.

[229336]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CDR: The ASA BREAKER is closed, but I closed the
      CABIN REPRESS.

[229345]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CC:  Okay, Jim. Looks like what we have to do is - In
     order to maintain even heating, we just have to
     yaw the whole machine about 90 degrees per hour
     in increments. So we'll give you a call when it's
     time to yaw 90 degrees.

[229384]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CDR: Okay. We have to YAW the machine as I understand
      it, Houston, and you'll give it to me in incre-
      ments of 90 degrees.

[229391]
_page : 245
_tape : 43/5
CC:  That's affirm.
     

[229456]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CC:  Okay, Jim. Your present configuration has
     the following features. We got the electrical
     BUSES cross tied through the BAL LOAD circuit
     breakers, and we have AUTO CABIN REPRESS. One
     thing we'd like to do right now is to give you
     an uplink, so immediately we have to, on panel 11,
     close the UPDATA LINK circuit breaker. Go to
     P00 and DATA. Over.

[229492]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CDR: Okay. We're going to P00 and DATA. The circuit
      breaker is closed.

[229737]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CDR: Houston, Aquarius. Did you say that you had a
      new pad for us to copy?

[229742]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CC:  Jim, I passed that newest pad that we have to
     Fred about 30 minutes ago. That's our latest.
     It's PC plus 2, and it begins with NOUN 33 of
     79 hours 27 minutes and 40.13 seconds. You got
     that one?

[229765]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CDR: Okay. We've got that one. What kind of a ATT
      HOLD MODE do you want us to do? Do you want us
      to do WIDE DEADBAND? I didn't ... on the DAP.

[229780]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CC:  Jim, the deadband is good the way it is. It's
     5 degrees, if you want to stay in it. And stay
     in the PGNS ATT HOLD mode.

[229789]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CDR: Okay.

[229833]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CC:  Two things, Jim. We want you to know that there's
     some pretty big attitude errors in, so if you go
     to AUTO, the computer is going to try to crank
     you around, and the other thing is don't drink
     water out of the LM.

[229854]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CDR: Okay. You might think about this. You know we
      lost our oxygen pressure in the command module.

[229916]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CC:  Aquarius, we're finished with the uplink. The
     computer is yours, and you can open the UPDATA
     LINK circuit breaker.

[229938]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CDR: Okay. We've opened up the UPDATA LINK, and we've
      gone OFF of DATA, and I've get 16 20 in the
      computer.

[229948]
_page : 246
_tape : 43/6
CC:  Roger, Jim. I guess we're going to just kind of
     perk away here now.
     

[229957]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CMP: Okay, Jack. One more question about Odyssey here.

[229965]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CC:  Go ahead, Jack.

[229970]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CMP: Okay. How about the service module O<sub>2</sub> supply
      valve? Do you want that off?

[229981]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CC:  Affirmative. Service module O<sub>2</sub> supply off, Jack.

[229986]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CMP: Okay. On the way.

[229997]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CC:  And, Jim, we see a PROGRAM ALARM in there. We
     think it's just got to do with pulling the UPDATA
     LINK circuit breaker - UPLINK too fast.

[230010]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CDR: Roger. I don't see it. Should I reset?

[230020]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CC:  Go ahead and reset, Jim.

[230171]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[230176]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[230181]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CDR: One thought that might occur here is that if we
      have low descent water pressure, we might con-
      sider taking the PLSS water and fill it in re-
      verse. If that works, you might look at a
      procedure for that.

[230194]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CC:  That's a good thought. Let us bounce that around
     a little.

[230232]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CC:  Okay, Jim. That's a good thought, and we've
     looked at that, and it looks like that's feasible.
     So if and when we need to do that, we will.

[230291]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CDR: And, something else, Jack. When it's time for
      me to make my 90-degree yaw, what I planned on
      doing was going to NOUN 76 hold and just pulse
      and yaw several times until the yaw start and hope
      that pitch and roll stay within the limit.

[230317]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CC:  Roger. It sounds like a good plan and you can
     use your TTCA in MIN IMPULSE to take care of
     pitch and roll.

[230327]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CDR: Okay.

[230421]
_page : 247
_tape : 43/7
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We see ASCENT O<sub>2</sub> tank num-
     ber 2 building up again, so we'd like to use
     something out of it, so turn on ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank
     number 2 and turn off descent O<sub>2</sub>.
     

[230439]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CDR: Roger. Opening up ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2, and
      turning off descent.

[230581]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CC:  And, Aquarius, Houston. We're starting to think
     about CO<sub>2</sub> buildup up in the command module there
     so we've got a recommendation, and what we're
     recommending is that you take the commander's
     hoses in the LM and put a cap over the red return
     hose and then figure out a way to fasten those
     hoses so they blow up into the CSM by extending
     them up through the tunnel as far as possible.
     And we'll get some flow out the blue side,
     circulate up and around the command module and
     to keep the CO<sub>2</sub> level down.

[230623]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CDR: Roger. We're thinking of that too, and one
      problem is that the COMM is connected securely
      to the hose, so we've got to get the COMM.cable
      off somehow to get that - So we'll still have
      COMM down here in the LM and you have the hose
      up there.

[230710]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CDR: Houston, we're trying to extend that commander's
      hose by use of the vacuum hose.

[230722]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CC:  Sounds like a good plan if you can work that
     out, Jim.

[230818]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CC:  Aquarius, if you can shake Jack loose there,
     I've got a - some procedures for him to write

[230857]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CC:  Oh, it's about 12 - 15 lines. It's a matter of
     verifying some valves and so forth.

[230870]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[230873]
_page : 248
_tape : 43/8
CC:  Okay. We want you to go in when you can and
     verify the following valves and leave them as we
     outline here. REPRESS PACKAGE valve, off;
     EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE, off; DIRECT O<sub>2</sub>, off;
     DEMAND REG, off; both WATER ACCUMULATORS, off;
     MAIN REG A and B, open; WATER GLYCOL - correc-
     tion - WATER and then GLYCOL TANK INLET and
     OUTLET, both. Now if you want to get some water,
     we recommend that you momentarily turn the SURGE
     TANK on to pressurize the system and then turn it
     off and take out water as required. Over.
     

[230973]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CC:  That's it, Jack. And another note on taking
     water; if you don't drain enough water so that - -

[230989]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CC:  Say again, Aquarius.

[230993]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CDR: That wasn't us, Jack.

[230998]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CC:  Okay. One more note on the water, Jack. If
     you don't bleed the pressure off when you -
     don't take enough water to bleed the pressure off
     completely, the pressure that's left on there is
     going to drain away in a period of 1 to 3 hours.
     So it's a small amount of oxygen, but we might
     as well save it. So if you want to eliminate
     that problem you could completely drain the pres-
     sure off by putting the water in a water bag and
     saving it that way.

[231036]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CMP: Okay. That's a good idea.

[231038]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CC:  So that's the end of my - -

[231039]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CMP: What I'll do - let me repeat - Okay. Let me
      repeat it all back to you. REPRESS PACKAGE VALVE,
      off; EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE, off; DIRECT O<sub>2</sub>,
      off; both the DEMAND REGs, off; both H<sub>2</sub>O ACCUMU-
      LATORS, WATER GLYCOL ACCUMULATORS, off; MAIN
      REG A and B, open; WATER and GLYCOL TANK INLET
      and OUTLET, open; for water, momentarily pres-
      surize the SURGE TANK, take out water as re-
      quired. You're recommending drain out all the
      water until I can't get any more water out of
      it in order to conserve the oxygen.

[231094]
_page : 249
_tape : 43/9
CC:  Okay. We just want you to turn off the water
     accumulators and not the glycol accumulator.

CC:  Okay, Jim. We've come up with a COMM recommen-
     dation which we hope will save some power by
     powering down the power amplifier, if it works.
     And I'd like to read up the steps to you and
     have you think about them for a minute, and we
     recommend trying it before the first yaw
     maneuver. Over.

[233263]
_page : 250
_tape : 43/10
CDR: Okay. You can read up the steps.

[233268]
_page : 250
_tape : 43/10
CC:  Okay. Step 1, BIOMED off; step 2, go to LOW BIT
     RATE; step 3, go to DOWNVOICE BACKUP; step 4,
     POWER AMP to PRIME; step 5, panel 16, POWER AMP
     CIRCUIT BREAKER open; step 6, RANGE FUNCTION
     switch, off. Read those back to me, and then
     I'll have a remark.
     

[233319]
_page : 251

      BACKUP; POWER AMP to PRIME; circuit breakers,

      RANGE FUNCTION switch, off.

[233336]
_page : 251
_tape : 43/11
CC:  Okay. And the note says that you should be able
     to hear us. If we can't hear you in a couple of
     minutes, you should close the POWER AMP circuit
     breaker on panel 16, and we expect to save an
     amp or more on this. It should work in the pres-
     ent attitude. When we go to the new yaw attitude,
     we're thinking about powering up the steerable,
     leaving the POWER AMP off and, if we can get
     good COMM in that mode, we'll still save some
     power. So if you concur, why don't you go ahead.

[233384]
_page : 251
_tape : 43/11
CDR: Okay. In this mode, you should hear us - or we
      should hear you, but if you can't hear us, then

     cannot monitor the DSKY for program alarms,

     you to do so on board, you push in the following
     circuit breakers: On panel 11 and panel 16 the
     ANUNCIATOR/DOCK/COMPONENT circuit breakers. That
     will allow you to monitor your DSKY warning

_page : 259
_tape : 44/7
CDR: Joe, it appears that the best detent possibly
      to put the stars in the AOT, would be either
      number 2 or 4. The rendezvous radar antenna
      is now in the way. You might think of a pro-
      cedure to get rid of it with minimum power
      and then we maybe we'll be able to see stars
      in a couple of minutes here in a lower detent.

[237108]
_page : 259
_tape : 44/7
CC:  Okay, Jim. I think I understood that the
     rendezvous radar antenna is in the way and you
     would like a procedure to get it out of the
     way. Is that right?

[237120]
_page : 259

[237569]
_page : 259

     apparently they want to make sure that they
     lockup with you and not the IU.

     VOICE BACKUP COMM configuration, which is pulling
     the power amd circuit breaker and going to DOWN
     VOICE BACKUP. If we get into a COMM problem, all

     don't want to power up the command module before
     EI minus 2 hours. That doesn't mean we can't
     start our procedure a good deal before that,

      been living on the LM, now?

[250176]

_tape : 46/6
CC:  Okay, the time of transfer to LM power was
     57 hours, 11 minutes. For your information,
     we seem to be reasonably fat on power. In fact,
     we are looking at a procedure that we might
     recommend to you later on after the burn and so
     forth of powering up one of the command module
     main buses via the LM umbilical. This would
     enable us possibly to charge up the command
     module batteries. Over.

[250216]
_page : 272

     looking good. We can't yet explain the attitude
     error needle thing, but I suggest you continue
     on in your maneuver.

[268001]
_page : 302
_tape : 
CC:  13, Houston. We see you now in the AUTO maneuver.
     How are your error needles looking now?

[268010]
_page : 302
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. They look like they are working their
      way in, Vance.

[268014]
_page : 302
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. You think maybe they are working right
     now?

[268020]
_page : 302
_tape : 
CDR: Yes. Because we got a 270-degree roll, our pitch
      and yaw needles are reversed.

[268026]
_page : 302
_tape : 
CC:  Okay.

[268042]

[268133]
_page : 302
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We appear to be there -
      at the burn attitude. And now do you want us to
      change the DAP?

[268141]
_page : 302
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, Jim. We have a procedure to give you
     for widening the deadband to 5 degrees for the
     PTC in the next 3 or 4 hours, if you're ready
     to copy.
     	Tape 50/2

[268169]
_page : 303
_tape : 
CDR: Go ahead.

[268170]
_page : 303
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. VERB 21, NOUN 01, ENTER; 3011, ENTER;
     44, ENTER. Now, that's the procedure for
     widening the deadband to 5 degrees with the DAP.
     Later on, prior to the burn, you would return
     the deadband to 1.4 degrees, and if you're
     ready to copy, I'll read you that.

[268211]
_page : 303
_tape :

[268213]
_page : 303
_tape :

[268238]
_page : 303
_tape : 
CDR: Go ahead.

[268240]
_page : 303
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. To return the deadband later to
     1.4 degrees: VERB 21, NOUN 01, ENTER; 3011,
     ENTER; 200, ENTER. Over.

[268263]
_page : 303
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, Vance. To widen the deadband, we'll enter
      a VERB 21, NOUN 01, ENTER; 3011, ENTER; 44, ENTER.
      Before the burn to go back to narrow deadband,
      it's VERB 21, NOUN 01, ENTER; 3011, ENTER;
      200, ENTER.

[268282]
_page : 303
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, Readback correct.

[268350]
_page : 303
_tape :

_page : 303
_tape :

[268393]
_page : 303
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, that's affirm. You'll be doing the PTC
     in yaw, and we'll give you a call at each time
     you change yaw - yaw attitude. Aside from that,
     request low bit rate off; then DOWN VOICE BACKUP
     OFF; then POWER AMPL OFF; and then FDA OFF.

[268422]
_page : 303
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, Vance. On the power down, we go low bit
      rate; DOWN VOICE BACKUP, we'll pull the POWER
      AMPL breaker; and we'll power down the FDI and
      the AC.

[268435]

_tape : 
CC:  Fred, one - one point on the PTC requests that,
     about an hour or less from now when you make
     your 90-degree change, that you do it in PGNS
     AUTO as opposed to ATT HOLD. Reason is that if
     you're in ATT HOLD, it establishes a new null
     point each time you stop the - the maneuver.
     Over.

[269470]
_page : 305
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. You want us to make the maneuver with
      PGNS AUTO rather than the PGNS ATT HOLD. Is
      that right?

[269478]
_page : 305
_tape : 
CC:  Yes. That's correct.

[269493]
_page : 305

     maneuver.

[269513]
_page : 305
_tape :

     It will be a manual maneuver, but with the PGNS

     updates. We've got some vectors for you and a
     P30 pad. And we'll - when you get to that state,
     we'll let you know when we want to uplink. Okay.
     Under "AGS Activation and Self Test," perform
     the entire procedure. On page 13, under "AGS
     Aline," do step 1; under "DAP Set, Gimbal/
     	Tape 50/8
     	Page 302

     "AUTO." Over.

[270433]
_page : 309
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. I'll catch up here. On page 12, you'll
      give us MSFN updates, some vectors, and a P30;
      and we're to do the entire "AGS Activation and
      Self Test." On page 13, we'll do the "AGS Align"
      and under "DAP Set, Gimbal/Throttle Test,"
      step 1, I've changed "THROTTLE CONTROL MANUAL"
      to "THROTTLE CONTROL AUTO."

[270463]

     Over.

[270495]
_page : 309

      changed to 31021. I assume you will give us any
      updated weights if we need any, and after the
      NOUN 47, a "VERB 34, ENTER." So, I - you're
      saying our gimbals look all right.

[270515]
_page : 309
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirmative on the gimbals, Fred. Nothing
     else on page 14. Proceed to page 15, and under
     "RCS CHECKOUT," we'd like to scratch that wording
     and just say "Verify the following switches:
     GUIDANCE CONTROL, PGNS;" step 3 - correction -
     it's line 3, change "ATTITUDE CONTROL (3)" to
     "MODE CONTROL;" "MODE CONTROL (BOTH)" to "AUTO."
     Verify ACA PROP, LMP ENABLE; ACA/4 JET, LMP
     ENABLE; TTCA/TRANSLATION, LMP, ENABLE. That is
     all on page 15. Over.

[270585]
_page : 309
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. On page 15, we'll change the heading
      "RCS CHECKOUT" to "Verify following switches,"
      and those switches are "GUIDANCE CONTROL, PGNS;"
      third line, "ATTITUDE CONTROL (3)" to "MODE
      CONTROL" now; and then "MODE CONTROL (BOTH)" to

_page : 310
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. And you can forget the "APS Follow-up,"
     too. Okay, on page 17, perform all of the AGS
     entries and at 4 minutes, we got a change.
     First line, CB(16) INVERTER 3, CLOSE; line 2,
     scratch out "Select INVERTER 1." At - proceeding
     on down the page, after "ATTITUDE MONITOR," we' d
     like you to place the RATE SCALE to "25 degrees
     a second." Okay, proceeding on down four more
     lines to "BALANCE COUPLE," we'd like to turn
     "BALANCE COUPLE-OFF." That's to keep the
     upfiring jets off of the CSM, in case we have
     to damp any rates in AGS, though we don't think
     we will. Then perform the rest of that page as
     written. Over.

[270764]
_page : 310
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, on page 17. Do the AGS load at minus
      4 minutes; it's CB(11), INVERTER 2, CLOSE, and
      scratch "Select INVERTER 1." RATE SCALE changed
      to "25 degrees a second." "BALANCE COUPLE,"
      we'll turn "OFF;" and, incidentally, on the AGS
      dampen rates point, it brings up the discussion
      we'd had before, Charlie, on takeovers. You
      might discuss what it's going to cost us DELTA-V-
      wise, if we get a control problem, to just shut
      her off and it take 30 minutes to regroup for a
      good manual burn.

[270806]
_page : 310
_tape : 
CC:  Fred, we already got that story for you, pretty
     well in hand. We're reviewing it right now.
     	Tape 50/10
     	Page 304
     
     And I'd like to defer that question until later
     on. Basically, we're just going to shut down
     and take what we got, and we got a midcourse
     of about - the maximum of 5 foot per second,
     anywhere in the burn to get back to free return.
     That - that's basically the story. We'll give
     you the mission rules for this burn momentarily.
     I'd like to proceed on to page 18, at minus
     1 minute, scratch "MASTER ARM - ON." Stand by.

[270847]
_page : 311
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, on page 18, and I've already done that at
      1 minute; "MASTER ARM - ON," I'll scratch - -

[270854]
_page : 311
_tape : 
CDR: - - Slipped that ... and I won't have anything
      to do - -

[270855]
_page : 311
_tape : 
LMP: - - I've already scratched "CB(16) ABORT STAGE -
      CLOSE" for the previous burn.

[270860]
_page : 311
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We want you to close the CB(16) ABORT
     STAGE. Over.

[270873]
_page : 311
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. You got some special reason for that?

[270876]
_page : 311
_tape : 
CC:  Yes, sir. We like - In case we don't get a
     manual ON - I mean, an AUTO ON, we're going to
     back up using the abort stage in the descent-
     engine command override at ignition plus 1 second.
     Backing up to page 17, at minus 4 minutes, you
     read "CB(11) INVERTER 2," it should be "CB(16)
     INVERTER 2." Over.

[270903]
_page : 311
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, I got you, Charlie. 17, "CB(16) INVERTER 2,
      CLOSE."

[270908]
_page : 311
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, back to page 18. We'll continue on as is
     at 30 seconds, 10 seconds, 7 seconds, minus
     5 seconds. At "ignition," no ignition and we'll
     add here, "no ignition, START pushbutton - push;
     still no ignition, DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND
     OVERRIDE, ON." Over.

[270945]
_page : 311
_tape :

      closer.

[270958]
_page : 311
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, on channel - on page 18, right on down the
      line, everything holds until after "ignition";
      "if no ignition, START puskbutton -push; still
      no ignition, DESCENT EN3INE COMMAND OVERRIDE
      switch ON."

[270974]
_page : 312
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, good readback, Fred-o. At plus 15 seconds,
     scratch "MASTER ARM - OFF;" and at - proceeding
     on down to "At Engine Cutoff," it's - after the
     "MODE CONTROL: PGNS to ATT HOLD," we'd like a
     "VERB 76," and the "Damp Excessive Rates Via
     the LM Y, Z Translation." Over.

[271008]
_page : 312
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, scratch "MASTER ARM - OFF" at plus 15, and
      "At Engine Cutoff" after "MODE CONTROL: PGNS -
      ATT HOLD," we want a "VERB 76 ENTER," and "Damp
      Excessive rates Via LM Y, Z translation." And
      a question on the - propellant quantity, we expect
      it to get down below 37 percent on this burn.
      Does that compare with that burn time when you
      get down to it.

[271036]
_page : 312
_tape : 
CC:  That's negative. At this - this burn, we're
     looking at - not reaching 37 percent, so I
     don't think wetll have to perform that step.
     We will verify that for you. Okay. One other
     statement: "At Engine Cutoff, if manual start,
     then at 30 feet per second to go, throttle to
     40 percent. At DELTA-V equals zero, stop push-
     button, push." Over.

[271091]
_page : 312
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, Charlie. If a manual start, that was
      throttle to 40 percent at - Was that 30 foot
      per second to go?

[271099]
_page : 312
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirmative. At 30 foot per second to go.

[271110]
_page : 312
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Then it's stop pushbutton at VGO equals
      zero?

[271116]
_page : 312
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirmative. What we want to do, if we
     got a manual start, we're going to have to shut
     down manually, and, to get a better guided cut-
     off at 30 foot per second to go, we want you to
     throttle at 40 and acceleration is within reason
     there, and we feel like we can get a good manual
     cut-off. 0ver.

[271136]
_page : 312
_tape : 
LMP: Okay.

[271139]
_page : 312

     That's all. We'll have the powerdown checklist
     for you momentarily, and we'd like to ask you

     the same comments apply about the manual start:
     "At the ignition time, if no start, manual START
     pushbutton, push; if still no start, DESCENT
     ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE, ON." And the same
     comments apply to shutting down at manual start.
     Over.

[271314]
_page : 313
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. The same comments. I'll start at the top
      again here. Okay. "BALANCE COUPLE" should be
      changed to "OFF." Under TTCA, it should be
      "LMP TTCA" to "JET." Scratch "400 plus 1" at
      minus 2; scratch "MASTER ARM, ON" at minus 1.
      Add at minus 10 seconds "MANUAL ULLAGE"; add
      ignition - can add the comment about "If no

     the computer is yours again. The second thing,
     no PTC maneuvering will be required from now
     until burn, so you can just sit in the burn
     attitude. And the third thing is we'd like to
     back out of this procedure we just put you into
     to updata link, which would mean going from TM
     bit rate HI back to LO, RANGING to OFF, VOICE
     to DOWN VOICE, PRIMARY POWER AMPL to CLOSE.

[328253]
_page : 427
_tape : 62/4
CC:  Okayy, Jack. I concur. I think it'll work, too.
     There's one step that i omitted, which you can
     do now qulte conveniently, and it's this. Where
     you stuff the towel in the bypass hole on the
     bottom, we recommend that you cut a few short
     pieces of tape and just tape that over so it
     doesn't fall out. Over.

[328277]

      thing to do, and that's ... seal that top.

CMP: Okay, Joe. That's done.

[328350]
_page : 427
_tape : 62/4
CC:  Okay, Jack. Now the remaining steps are simply
     suit-loop configuration steps to get this thing
     into full operation, and our ECS people want to
     hold off on that until the canister you're working 
     on gets to 7.6 millimeters of mercury, which
     will probably be another 45 minutes or an hour -
     it - We're reading 4.7 now. So what we'd like
     you to do in the interim is to set up the second
     command module canister the same way you just did
     the first one, using the commander's hose, and
     get that all set and probably about that time
     it'll be time to - to switch over. For your information, 
     when you've got that done and if you've
     had your breakfast and so on, the next thing
     I've got for you is a switch-configuration list
     for the command module, which will represent the -
     the powerdown, square-1 starting configuration
     for all our - our preentry checks. Over.

     do with the commander's hose is get the bag all

[383628]
_page : 537
_tape :

     sleeping, and who's working?

[383635]
_page : 537
_tape : 
CMP: Well, right now we're all three kind of
      working. Do you have any recommendations?

[383644]
_page : 537
_tape : 
CC:  Yes, looks like to us from here that you and
     Fred ought to get some sleep, and that you
     ought to eat in about 6 hours. And that the
     Skipper ought to go to bed about 113 hours.

[383663]
_page : 537
_tape : 
CMP: Okay.

[383664]
_page : 537
_tape : 
CC: I've got some other information. We shouldn't
     have some good dope on your trajectory for about
     2 hours. Looked like to us that the burn was
     real good, however, and we're taking a close
     look at it, and we'll get back with you on that
     in about 2 hours from now. Another thing that
     we're expecting to have happen is that the
     SHe tank is going to reach its burst limit. The
     earliest time we predict this will happen will
     be at 107 hours on about 25 minutes. And the
     latest probable time is at 110 hours, and this
     is supposed to be a nonpropulsive vent, but you
     might hear it and you might see something.

[383706]
_page : 537
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. That's good news. We were wondering about
      that. And I'll relay all the other information
      you gave me.

[383714]
_page : 537
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. And if the SHe tank does burst during this
     time frame before we get trajectory info, why,
     that will delay our trajectory info somewhat.
     Your consumables, your rater is now good through
     152 hours.

[383732]

[383734]

[383754]
_page : 538
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We're predicting that you still have
     more water than you need. And one thing we'd
     like for you to do is when you're going to
     sleep up there in the command module take
     a look through the optics and see if you can
     see any stars.

[383777]
_page : 538
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Jack, I will do. Jim and I were able to
      spot constellations from the windows of the LM
      when there's no venting taking place. Could
      you give me some time on these consumables, what
      you're predicting they're good for? I think
      you started to give them times, didn't you, or
      was I just hearing things.

[383816]
_page : 538
_tape : 
CC:  We started to give you some times. We think we
     might be able to give you some better ones pretty
     soon. But it looks like your water is good
     through 154 hours, and you've got takusan O<sub>2</sub>
     through 272 hours, plenty of lithium hydroxide,
     and your amp-hours ought to be good through 199
     or 200 hours. Over.

[383854]
_page : 538
_tape : 
CMP: Okay; good. Copy that.

[383864]
_page : 538
_tape : 
CC:  We expect that your water rate is going to drop
     off and at the time, DELTA will go up to 160 -
     165 hours quite shortly. Another thing we're
     interested in is what's your status on rest and
     medication.

[383883]
_page : 538
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. None of us, I know of, had any medications,
      and right now as far as rest, I suppose we're no
      tireder than normally in this situation. I'm
      going to relay the work-sleep cycle.

[383900]
_page : 538
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. And don't forget to look through the optics
     when you go up in the command module.

[383910]

[384004]

      to vent a little from the command module ...

[384046]

     too much background noise to read you. I think
     we'll have to wait until you come up on a new

     can hear you.

[384063]
_page : 539
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Okay, Jack. I was going to say, as
      luck would have it, the command module picked
      this time to start venting again, so I probably
      won't be able to get a good hack out of stars
      out of the telescope.

[384080]
_page : 539
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Thank you. And if you can think of it,
     when the time comes up, when you're not venting
     how about remembering to take a look through
     them and give us a word?

[384091]

[384305]
_page : 539
_tape : 
CMP: Yes, Jack. I just got a question. How long are
      you predicting our command module canisters to
      last in here?

[384320]
_page : 539
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jack. We've got 14 cartridges that'll last
     157 hours, plus we've got the LM primary cartridge
     with 23 hours, and we've got two PLSS cartridges
     with 7 hours apiece.

[384335]
_page : 539
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. I was just curious as to how much time
      we've got out of these two cartridges.

[384342]
_page : 539
_tape : 
CC:  Stand by 1. I'll get a prediction on that. By
     the way, I hope you're keeping track of the ones
     you've used and the ones you've not.

[384351]
_page : 539
_tape : 
CMP: Yes, right now, we have numbers 7 and 8 in the
      LM here.

[384613]

_tape : 
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. In regards to the CO<sub>2</sub>
     canisters, by the way the PCO<sub>2</sub> is reading 1.6
     down here now. We expect that we can get 6 more
     hours out of the two canisters that we have
     there - 6 hours at least. However, at 112 hours,
     	Tape 72/4
     	Page 533
     
     when we've got several people up, we're going to
     rig up two more and we have the new simplified
     procedure for doing this. However, in the
     meantime, should we need to have a canister
     change, we plan to switch to the LM primary
     canister. Over.

[384652]
_page : 540
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Copy that, Jack.

[384668]
_page : 540
_tape :

[384674]
_page : 540
_tape :

      starts high in the LMP's window and goes low in
      the CDR window.

[384697]
_page : 540
_tape : 
CMP: So we've got a little bit of a wobble on it.
      Of course, the command module venting doesn't
      help, either.

_tape :

[385366]
_page : 540
_tape : 
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[385370]
_page : 540
_tape : 
CMP: Jack, in reference to your question about the PTC,
      on this last complete revolution, the Sun first
      appeared in the very top right corner of the LMP
      window, passed over the CDR window, and was
      visible through the overhead window, and now
      the Moon is - came pretty well through the center
      of both windows this last time.

[385640]
_page : 540
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Thank you, Jack. Copying that.

[385643]
_page : 540
_tape : 
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to get a little
     better idea of how PTC is going. So, what
     we'd like for you to do is what we did last time.
     That is to give us a reading on the center of
     the Earth and the center of the Moon on the - LPD.

[385669]
_page : 540
_tape : 
CMP: On the LPD. Okay, It's shifted. Let's see, the
      Moon's gone by and the Earth didn't come into the
      LPD last time.

[385683]
_page : 540
_tape :

     tell us where it was. Okay?

[385690]
_page : 540
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Will do.

[386014]
_page : 540
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Jack. This pass, the Earth came into view
      at the top left-hand corner of the LMP's window
      	Tape 72/5
      	Page 534
      and was going down. However, when it passed it
      wasn't as high up as the last pass. It did pass
      into view at the CDR window, but too high up to
      get an LPD reading.

[386037]
_page : 541
_tape : 
CC: Roger. Understand it went high in both windows
     then.

[386044]
_page : 541
_tape : 
CMP: Yes, last time it wasn't even visible in the
      CDR's window; this time it was visible if you
      squatted down, but too high up to get an LPD
      reading.

[386054]

CDR: Okay. Understand, the no-COMM pad is no longer
      valid because of the midcourse. Entry angle
      based on the last 2 hours' tracking is 5.99,
      and I take it you're going to keep tracking for
      some time now to see whether we need another
      midcourse or not.

_page : 544
_tape :

[390305]
_page : 544
_tape : 
CDR: Are you planning any no-COMM midcourse at 134 # last character suspect
      and change anyway right now, or are you going
      to wait?

[390314]
_page : 544
_tape : 
CC: We're discussing that now, Jim, and it looks
     like we're going to wait on the tracking. For
     the time being, since you're in the corridor,
     why, there's no need to pass it up. But we're
     going to keep looking at the tracking, and
     we'll probably come up with one.

[390334]
_page : 544
_tape : 
CDR: All right. I'm not too sure what the venting
      is going to do to us so - when this SHe tank
      ruptures, what it's going to do for us.

[390347]
_page : 544
_tape : 
CC: Roger. We don't presently expect the SHe tank
     to have any effect on your trajectory, and the
     pressure's up to 1921 now.

[390359]
_page : 544

      expected. What a way to get a data point.

[390395]

      going to sleep through all your watches.

[390401]

[390408]
_page : 544

[392077]
_page : 544
_tape :

      Underneath quad 4, I noticed a lot of sparklies
      going out.

[392090]
_page : 544
_tape : 
CC:  Can you hear or feel anything?

[392094]
_page : 544
_tape : 
CDR: No, I sure can't, but I think it changed our -
      it changed out PTC. Let me check and see what
      the drift is.

[392109]
_page : 544
_tape :

[392118]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CDR: I think we're probably going to have to
      reestablish PTC. Yes, we got pretty fast yaw drifting,
      Jack.

[392157]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CDR: Houston, Aquarius. What are your plans?

[392161]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CC: We're thinking about them right now. Did you
     say it yawed some?

[392168]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CDR: Yes, I was in a right yaw and now I'm in a left,
      yaw; at a much faster rate than the one we put
      in PTC.

[392188]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. We're talking it over. Stand by.

[392240]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CDR: What's the SHe tank down to now, Jack?

[392244]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. It's going through 125 pounds now.
     And we understood you to say - -

[392250]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CDR: Okay.

[392251]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CC:  - - that it reversed your yaw. Is that affirma-
     tive?

[392257]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CDR: Sure did, Jack. It reversed my yaw completely
      and put in a little pitch, I think.

[392273]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CDR: But more than anything, it reversed my yaw.

[392276]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. Have you effectively established PTC
     in the opposite direction then?

[392284]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CDR: Well, you could say that. I'm not too sure
      just what kind of pitch or roll I've got,
      coupled with the yaw. I just saw the Earth go
      by the LMP's window here, not too long ago at
      a rather faster rate than we had going the
      other direction.

[392318]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CDR: Perhaps you can tell how fast I'm having to
      shift OMNIs.

[392322]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CC:  Yes, we can tell the COMM cycling back and forth.

[392332]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CDR: Is that what they call a nonpropulsive vent?

[392336]
_page : 545
_tape : 
CC:  Right. I'd hate to see a propulsive one.

[392341]
_page : 545
_tape :

      	Tape 73/4
      	Page 539

[392344]
_page : 546
_tape : 
CC: It's going through 50 pounds now. So, are you
     seeing fewer sparklies?

[392352]
_page : 546
_tape : 
CDR: Yes. Much fewer. Not any at all, now. I'm
      not sure whether that vent gave me reverse yaw
      and roll - left roll - that's - if that's what
      it gave me.

[392374]
_page : 546
_tape : 
CC:  You say you think it might have given you some
     left roll as opposed to opposite yaw.

[392385]
_page : 546
_tape : 
CDR: I'm sure it gave me the yaw, Jack, but I'm not
      too sure ...

[392390]
_page : 546
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We'd kind of like to watch it, see what
     happens for a little while before we make a
     recommendation. However, we'll need some inputs
     from you on that.

[392402]
_page : 546
_tape : 
CDR: Well, we're in no trouble up here as far as -
      as far as the yaw goes. Everything's fine.
      It's faster than we had set up before. We just
      wanted to get into proper thermal constraint,
      and it's going to take me 15 minutes to get the
      thrusters up anyway.

[392458]
_page : 546
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Skipper. We don't see any thermal problems
     as a result of this change. If we see some
     communications problems, we may have to do
     something different, but so far, so good. And
     we'd kind of like to hear from you on LPD num-
     bers, if you get anything going by the window.

[392488]
_page : 546
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Will do.

[392523]
_page : 546
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Jack. The Earth just went through at
      an LPD of 26 degrees.

[392529]
_page : 546
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. The Earth went through at 26 degrees
     going the opposite direction this time - left
     to right. Is that right?

[392537]
_page : 546
_tape : 
CMP: From left to right. That's affirmative.

[392552]
_page : 546
_tape : 
CC: Of course, the only other thing that we'd be
     concerned about is what change in your velocity
     this might have had and what DELTA-V it imparted,
     and we'll have to look at that for a while before
     we are able to determine it. And, if there is
     no significant change, why, we prefer just to
     leave it the way it is.

[392907]

      10 degrees, and now we're getting to the Earth
      again. Stand by.

[392948]
_page : 547
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. The Earth came through the LPD at
      62 degrees that time. And the total time for
      the two revolutions, - I missed the Earth
      revolution before, but the total time for the
      Earth's two revolutions was 3 minutes and
      50 seconds.

[392973]
_page : 547

     number. You're in the background noise, Jack.

[392979]

CMP: Okay. Ok, Jack. LPD that time was 62 degrees
      and that was for two revolutions, being at that
      distance we missed the Earth - The time before

      and 50 seconds.

_page : 550
_tape :

      we're doing about it. We'll try to keep up with
      it. And you're satisfied with this attitude so
      far. I guess you're going to watch the thermal
      and find out whether perhaps we're going to some
      other PTC attitude.

[393895]
_page : 550
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. Thermal appears to be no problem. We're
     looking at what DELTA-V might have been imparted
     due to this, and it looks like we're not going
     to change the PTC attitude.

[393914]
_page : 550
_tape :

      raised that angle a little bit.

[393944]

     This is on the basis of all the data we've col-
     lected between the midcourse up to the time the
     SHe tank went. So we'll continue to look at it,
     and see if SHe tank did anything to it at all.

_page : 552
_tape : 
CC:  Jim, we've had a lot of people working on the
     entry procedures, and they'll be continuing to
     do so. We got a few ideas we'd like to toss at
     you so you can start thinking about them if you
     think you're in a position to discuss them with-
     out waking up the other guys. What do you think?

[397416]
_page : 552
_tape : 
CDR: Yes, go ahead. It's okay.

[397420]
_page : 552
_tape : 
CC: Okay. One of the first things we want to do is
     charge the battery in CSM, so we can get some
     LM power over there to do that, and we have pro-
     cedures ginned up to do it. In regards to
     reentry, we're planning our last midcourse at
     5 hours before entry interface, and, if we have
     to make one, that is. And then we'd like to
     jettison the service module at 4 hours and a
     half, roughly, before entry interface, and take
     the next 3 to 3-1/2 hours for taking pictures,
     cranking up the command module G&N, taking care
     of stowage, and other odds and ends. And we'd
     hang on to the LM until 1 hour before entry
     interface, and then we'd jettison that. And
     these procedures are going to be run integrated
     in the CMS and LMS tomorrow morning, and, hope-
     fully, later on in the day, we'll do it again
     with Mission Control on the loop. A couple of
     other things we'd like to toss at you: one
     question is what do we do with the OPS. The
     thought is that there is adequate O<sub>2</sub> in the
     command module and that the OPS represents high
     pressure source and a stowage problem, and people
     are thinking about leaving them in the LM. The
     other thing is that we think you might want to
     make this a suited entry, suiting up prior to
     LM jettison, because what we're doing is, when
     we jettison the LM, we're going to do it like
     	Tape 74/4
     	Page 546
     we did in Apollo 10 - just let the beauty go,
     and if we weren't suited, why, we'd be betting
     on the hatch seal to take care of us. So we
     thought we'd toss these few ideas at you. Some
     of them are ones that are particularly pertinent
     questions at this time.

[397546]
_page : 553
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. A suited entry would sort of ... the
      1-hour LM jettison back and ... back and forth
      up to that time .... impede our progress back
      and forth ....

_tape : 
CC:  We're losing you, Jim

[397573]
_page : 553
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. I think I've got you back. I guess the
      midcourse at 5 hours prior to ...

[397585]
_page : 553
_tape : 
CC: Affirmative, Jim. Midcourse 5 hours prior to
     entry interface.

[397595]
_page : 553
_tape : 
CDR: If that's the case, all I'm worried about is
      having that all squared away. It's long before
      that ... I want everything in its place. All
      the stowage cleared away, all the ... ready to
      go and know exactly what to do and ... so that
      we can do the midcourse, and ... get into the
      command module ... jettison the service module,
      and then know exactly how to get into the LM.

[397633]
_page : 553
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. Ail those procedures will work - will be
     worked out precisely, and we agree that the
     stowage and all of those peripheral details ought
     to be taken care of before midcourse.

[397651]
_page : 553
_tape : 
CDR: And, I guess, that last midcourse, we'd want to
      start looking at midcourse fairly early, if we
      have the power to do so, mainly because of atti-
      tude control. This last time was fairly easy,
      but I'm not too sure how long we can continue
      to ...

[397689]
_page : 553
_tape : 
CDR: I have ... in, and it seems about as cold as it
      is now, we'll probably be going into suits long
      before entry.

[397702]
_page : 553
_tape : 
CC:  Yes. That's what we were thinking.

[397730]
_page : 554
_tape : 
CC:  I guess the two things which are somewhat unre-
     solved at the moment are what to do with the OPS
     and what to do about the suited entry. We
     thought we'd toss those at you to see what you
     thought about them.

[397746]
_page : 554
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. As far as the OPS is concerned, we have
      enough oxygen in the spacecraft ... to get us
      through. I have no ... command module ... suit
      loop prior to entry. I was looking at ... OPS
      ... sources of oxygen ... also in the - in the
      front of the suit loop or ... circulate ...

[397806]
_page : 554
_tape : 
CC:  Jim, I'm sorry. We're not catching what you're
     saying. The COMM is getting kind of bad right
     now.

[397815]
_page : 554
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Jack. How do you read now?

[397818]
_page : 554
_tape : 
CC:  I've still got you with quite a bit of background
     noise, but if you talk up like that, I think we
     can hear you.

[397826]
_page : 554
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. My only concern about leaving the OPS
      and/or the PLSS in the command module is how
      soon do we have to live off the command module
      consumables prior to entry, and the PLSS has a
      fan and has a lithium hydroxide ... use the com-
      mand module system. Also, the OPS ... right
      now ... command module ... command module oxygen
      and electrical power is ... but I had just as
      soon be ... back in the LM.

[397870]
_page : 554
_tape : 
CC:  It sounds like the general gist of your comments
     are that if things remain pretty much as they
     are now in the command module, you'd just as soon
     leave the OPS in the LM. Is that affirm?

[397884]
_page : 554
_tape : 
CDR: That's affirm.

[397891]
_page : 554
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. And maybe you'd like to think over the
     suited entry bit a little while.

[397900]

[397926]
_page : 555
_tape : 
CDR: Okay ... How we aline the command module right
      for entry, especially if you have the LM in
      back. Over.

[397941]
_page : 555
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. That's one subject that's been getting
     a lot of attention, and let me see if I can get
     some general ideas on that at the moment.

[397953]
_page : 555
_tape : 
CDR: Okay.

[398136]
_page : 555
_tape : 
CC: Jim, I can give you the general idea of the
     proposed procedure for bringing the command
     module G&N up. It's the presently proposed one.
     We may come up with a better one, but here's
     what we're looking at right now. First thing we
     plan to do is to - using the LM COAS, sight on
     the Earth with the LM just as we did in the mid-
     course. Then we'll do a body-axis aline, 400
     plus 5 on the ACS, to put the AGS ball at 000.
     And then we can give you an AGS ball attitude to
     fly to, to point the CSM optics at the Moon.
     And, if you can see stars, why, we can use those
     too. Then we can give you an equivalent set of
     CDU angles to put into NOUN 20 and to torque the
     platform over. So, now we're coarse alined.
     Then we do a fine aline by shooting at the Moon
     and then at the Sun. Do you follow all that?

[398225]
_page : 555
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Jack. Let me see if I have it. What we
      do is point the LM at the Earth as we did for
      the midcourse COAS, and we do a body-axis aline
      on the AGS. Then you give us an AGS ball atti-
      tude to fly to .... the LM, and then we ...
      point the ... at the Moon. Then you would update
      the - give us some CDUs to coarse aline. ...
      fine aline ... on stars or the Moon or the Earth.
      Stand by. Okay. We had another MASTER ALARM,
      Jack. I don't see any lights down there, except
      the battery light's still there. You want - -
      ... display ECS. Okay. And the number 2 battery
      still has a light on it. I suspect it may be the
      same problem that we had before ......

[398310]
_page : 555
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Let us talk it over a second, and we'll
     tell you what to do.

[398340]
_page : 555
_tape : 
CC:  Jim, is the battery light kind of flickering?

[398346]
_page : 555
_tape : 
CDR: Yes. That's affirm, Jack.
      	Tape 74/7
      	Page 549
      

[398356]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CDR: Yes. The battery light's flickering, and it
      triggers off the MASTER ALARM.

[398361]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Well, that - temperature sensor on bat-
     tery 2 is kind of cycling back and forth and
     every time it does, it triggers a MASTER ALARM,
     Jim.

[398377]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Same old problem, huh?

[398379]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CC:  Yes.

[398413]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CC:  And, Jim, finally on the P52, we're considering
     using the - the Moon and then the Sun for the fine aline.

[398424]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. The Moon and the Sun for the fine aline.
      Understand. We'll go through this again here ...

[398455]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Jack. Once - Once I get the spacecraft at
      the proper attitude ...

[398482]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CC:  Jim, I didn't copy your last question due to
     background noise.

[398489]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Once - Once you get the AOS ball alined
      ... command module ...

[398509]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CC:  After we do the body axis aline on the AGS, we
     can tell you what attitude on the AGS ball to
     fly to in order to poiat the CSM optics at the
     Moon or at some star. And then we can, knowing
     where the optics are pointed, give you an equiv-
     alent set of CDU angles to put in NOUN 20 to
     torque the platform.

[398542]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. I see.

[398550]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CC:  That's the current thinking. It may change
     between now and tomorrow, but right now, that's
     the way it looks, Jim. It'll probably be some
     take-off on that anyway.

[398563]
_page : 556
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Are they planning on a G&N entry or using
      another system, like EMS or something like that?

[398574]

[398800]
_page : 557

[398806]
_page : 557

[398896]
_page : 557
_tape : 
CC:  Go ahoad.

[398899]
_page : 557
_tape : 
CDR: I understand that one of your reasons for a
      suited entry is the fact that the command module
      hatch ... hasn't been good. It doesn't seem to
      be any different, but in the other ... our hatch
      is no better than other spacecraft.

[398938]
_page : 557
_tape : 
CC:  No, the situation, Jim, is that your hatch is
     as good as any other hatch but that we won't
     have a chance to verify it until so late in the
     game, like 1 hour before entry interface, in this
     case; whereas before, why, we had a chance to
     evaluate it in lunar orbit. Over.

[398963]
_page : 557
_tape : 
CDR: Oh, okay.

[398967]
_page : 557
_tape : 
CC:  And that might make your time line a little too
     crowded, getting your suits on there at the last
     minute; say, less than an hour before entry
     interface.

[398984]
_page : 557
_tape : 
CDR: Okay.

[399030]
_page : 557
_tape : 
CC: Jim, the next action item we want to pursue is
     transferring some LM power up to the command
     module MAIN B so we can start charging battery,
     and I guess what we ought to do is start on that
     one when somebody else gets up to help you there.
     So, when you decide to get the other guys up, or
     to have someone help, why, let us know and we'll
     start working on that.

      on ...

[399127]
_page : 558
_tape : 
CC:  Jim, I didn't catch all of what you said, but I
     think you wanted to know when the procedures [on]
     entry are going to be available and read up to
     you. If that's the case, why, we're talking
     about 120 hours or so. As far as the - charging
     battery A, we want to do that as soon as the
     other guys get up to help you. We've already
     passed up some of that procedure, and we have a
     couple of DELTAs to it.

[399157]
_page : 558
_tape : 
CDR: Roger. Jack's already up. He asked ... curious
      when you wanted to do it. Did you understand
      that? ... Is that correct?

[399180]
_page : 558
_tape : 
CC:  Jim, we're having trouble hearing you. The next
     order of business is to charge battery A, and
     when you get somebody to help you there, why,
     we'll go ahead and get done with it.

[399193]
_page : 558

     next line, you had BATTERY 1 and 3. Make that
     BATTERY 1, 2, 3, and 4. Just add BATs 2 and 4.
     All four descent BATs. And then the next two
     lines about waiting 30 minutes, cross that out.

     we had to go back to the LM and do something.
     And the first line is okay, cross out "BAT 5
     and 6 OFF," delete that. And delete the next
     line also, that says "Panel 11 to 16 ASCENT ECA
     CONTROL, open." Then we had a couple of notes
     which remain the same. Go ahead.

[399560]
_page : 561
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. I didn't get the notes, but I'll read
      you the steps as I have them now. One step,
      BAT 1, 2, 3, and 4 ... and at this point should
      have BATTERIES 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 ON. Is that
      affirmative?

[399579]
_page : 561
_tape : 
CC: That's affirmative. So now we have BAT 1, 2,
     3, 4, and 6, ON, and I got two notes. Number 1
     is: your circuit breaker protection limits -
     your circuit breaker protection - limits the
     current to 15 amps. Number 2 note is: now the
     umbilical between the LM and the command module
     is hot. And the MAIN BUS voltage can be moni-
     tored by selecting MAIN B.

[399646]
_page : 561
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Jack. These notes are: circuit breaker
      protection limits current to 15 amps. The tube,
      the umbilical between the CSM and LM is hot.
      I can monitor MAIN B for the bus voltage.

[399664]
_page : 561
_tape :

[399682]
_page : 561
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Jack. One question here. If we transfer
      power like this, we're not going to cut us short
      on power remaining in the CSM ..., are we ...?

[399697]
_page : 561
_tape : 
CC:  Say it again, Jack. I didn't get it.

[399703]
_page : 561
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Stand by. If we configure the CSM for
      powering up the LM, we aren't going to cut it
      short on LM power requirements to get us back
      in the entry interface, are we?

[399723]
_page : 561

[399784]
_page : 562
_tape :

     want to know?

[399790]
_page : 562
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. He would like to know whether the proce-
      dure has been tried and whether it has been
      found to be okay; and there's no danger of
      shorting out any of our batteries or anything
      we have on board the LM now.

[399860]
_page : 562
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jack. This procedure has not been tried
     out as such; however, the hardware paths
     through which the current flows are the same
     ones which we used during translunar trajectory,
     and there's not a problem with shorting out a
     descent battery. Over.

[399887]
_page : 562
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. I'll relay that to Jim.

[399909]
_page : 562
_tape : 
CC:  Jack, of course, the reason for all of this is
     that we see we're 20 amp-hours short on one of
     the entry batteries, and we've got to juice
     that up to get you home with.

[399925]

CC:  Okay, Jack. I have the procedure in front of
     me. It's about 18 steps, and the reason it's
     so long is because we're starting from this
     basic configuration which we gave you earlier.
     It concerns a charge on battery A, of course,
     which is our low one. So, when you're ready
     to copy it, let me know.

[400000]
_page : 562
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Let's go at it.

[400006]
_page : 562
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Are you ready to read - copy it?

[400013]
_page : 562
_tape : 
CMP: Go ahead.

[400014]
_page : 562
_tape : 
CC: Okay. On panel 250, circuit breaker BAT A,
     POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, close; on panel 275,
     circuit breaker INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, close.
     Next several circuit breakers are on panel 5;
     	Tape 81/5

     whether we can use the attitude control -
     controller only to maneuver the combination to
     photograph the service module at 4 plus 30.

[433992]
_page : 599
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Good thinking. We are - it's - There has
     been a lot of consideration of what kind of
     maneuvers to let you do to photograph the LM, I
     mean the service module. We consider it quite
     low priority; the feeling is that it will be real
     nice to get pictures of the service module, but
     they are not required for our troubleshooting
     program. As far as the - the attitude control
     authority, and so forth, we will get you more
     detailed word on that later; we are working it.
     It appears that using the ACA instead of the
     TTCA after service module JETT will give you
     excellent attitude control authority, and that's
     what we recommend.

[434043]
_page : 599
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. And I'm ... - use an AGS ATT HOLD configura-
      tion to keep the attitudes - turn the LM JETT
      attitudes.

[434054]
_page : 599
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirm. We are - We are probably going to
     recommend a tight deadband AGS attitude hold for
     that.

[434063]
_page : 599
_tape : 
CDR: Okay.

[434085]
_page : 599
_tape :

[434087]
_page : 599
_tape : 
CC:  Go ahead.

[434089]
_page : 599
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. The star check at the entry attitude, is
      it a sextant star check or a COAS star check?

[434100]
_page : 599
_tape : 
CC:  It'll probably be a sextant star check, Jim. It
     really depends on how good that platform is that
     we get. And we expect it to be plenty good enough
     for a sextant star check.

[434114]
_page : 599
_tape : 
CDR: Okay.

[434115]
_page : 599
_tape : 
CC:  While we are on that subject, Jim, I want to
     mention one thing to Jack. As I said, this CSM
     alinement procedure we are going to recommend is
     a Moon/Sun, and there are Sim filters stowed;
     they are stowed in compartment R-1; however,
     they are for the telescope only, of course, not
     the sextant. One is for the long eye-relief
     	Tape 81/6
     	Page 593
     
     piece, the other for the normal eyepiece. And
     if he has any questions about that, we'll be
     glad to talk about it.

[434154]
_page : 600
_tape : 
CDR: Okay.

[434167]
_page : 600
_tape : 
CDR: And because it will be too late to do much about
      a hatch integrity check if it fails, you want us
      to have our suits on sometime during this period?

[434180]
_page : 600
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. We are laying for you on that one;
     it is a subject that we wanted to - to bring up
     with you. We have been considering it, and our
     feelings are - Of course, it is up to you, but
     as we see the pros and cons, you just put your
     finger on the pro. We do a hatch integrity
     check shortly before RI minus 1 hours, and if we
     bust it, you would have a hard time scrambling
     into the suits. On the other hand, the disad-
     vantages of wearing the suits are that they might
     slow you down considerably, not even counting the
     time to don them, and someone is even very
     concerned that after such and such a period of
     time in the suits, you might get too warm, and we
     might have to power up the SUIT LOOP to ventilate
     the suits and we don't particularly want to do that
     because it cost quite a bit of power. Consequent-
     ly, our recommendation was going to be that you
     not wear the suit, since we have no reason to
     believe that the integrity check will show us
     anything but a slightly increased leak rate, and
     we can certainly hack that. What do you think?
     Over.

[434258]
_page : 600
_tape : 
CDR: Well, I have confidence in the hatch, as long
      as it goes in and locks in smoothly; I see no
      reason why we need the suits, and one thing we
      are going to do during our spare time is to
      practice putting that hatch on, make sure we
      get it on and locked.

[434275]
_page : 600
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Real good. And with that precaution,
     think we can concur on that decision.

[434291]
_page : 600
_tape : 
CDR: And that's all the questions we had about
      the time line you gave us.

[434294]
_page : 600
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Let me take a check here and see if there
     is anything anybody else wants to input to you,
     right now.

[434338]
_page : 601
_tape : 
CDR: Go ahead.

[434339]
_page : 601
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. One detail that I thought you ought to
     know about the service module JETT is that we're
     going to recommend a push-pull maneuver, that is
     in the attitude I described. We'll want you to
     go half a foot per second plus-X on the LM, then
     jettison the service module, then go half a foot
     per second minus-X, which will be less time be-
     cause you're suddenly a heck of a lot lighter.
     Over.

[434373]
_page : 601
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Understand. You want me to go a half a
      foot per second plus-X, JETT the service module,
      and go a half a foot per second minus-X.

[434385]
_page : 601
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirm. We think that will give you plenty
     of separation, and also will be a slow enough rate
     so you'll have a chance to get some photos.

[434466]
_page : 601
_tape : 
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[434468]
_page : 601
_tape : 
CDR: Go ahead.

[434470]
_page : 601
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. One more thing we want to update you on
     with a little detail. As we told you, the ascent
     SEP attitude was in plane and the LM JETT atti-
     tude will be more similar to a normal service
     module SEP attitude, that is it will be LM up,
     out the radius vector and 45 degrees right, out
     of plane toward the south. We are going to recom-
     mend that prior to JETT, the configuration be
     with the LM overhead hatch closed, with the vent
     valve open, and we'll JETT with the tunnel
     pressurized. Over.

[434530]
_page : 601
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Joe. Understand that the LM JETT
      attitude will be similar to service module
      normal jettison, which will be up and out of
      plane, and as soon as I finish maneuvering to
      left JETT attitude, I'll scramble up and close
      the LM hatch, making sure the vent valve is open,
      and then we'll vent it - or jettison it with
      the tunnel pressurized.

[434556]
_page : 601
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirmative. And Deke says don't forget
     to close the command module hatch on your way
     in.
     	Tape 81/5
     	Page 595
     

[434565]
_page : 602
_tape : 
CDR: I'm already scared that Jack will have it closed
      before I get up there.

[434569]
_page : 602
_tape : 
CC:  (Laughter)

[434588]
_page : 602
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. I think that's about all we have
     for you right now. Whenever you feel like you
     don't have any more questions at the moment,
     we'd like you to reeonfigure for down voice
     backup and we'd like you to do that to move
     the VOICE FUNCTION switch to DOWNVOICE BACKUP
     as usual, but instead of pulling the circuit
     breaker, we'd like you to throw the POWER AMP
     switch to off.

[434640]
_page : 602
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Joe. I have one more question, here. If
      we get a little bit ahead of time on the command
      module full powerup after we Jettison the ser-
      vice module, I'd like to go to LM JETT attitude
      early, and make sure we get that part squared
      away and sit there for a while before LM JETT
      of 1 hour. Now, will we be using LM power up
      to that time? There's two cables which we'll
      probably have to disconnect on the way up
      through the tunnel if we're still going to use
      LM power?

[434670]
_page : 602
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirmative. Let me get word on when we
     expect to go off LM power.

[434694]
_page : 602
_tape : 
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[434698]
_page : 602
_tape : 
CDR: Go ahead.

[434699]
_page : 602
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. We expect to go off LM power at the time
     we start powering up the CSM or about minus 2-1/2
     hours. That is not a hard number, and we'll be
     updating you on it. As far as going to the LM
     JETT attitude, that's completely permissible
     as soon as you have a powered up command module
     and a satisfactory platform, you can go there
     immediately. We're giving you a maximum of
     1 hour just for grins. Over.

[434734]
_page : 602
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Fine. And that will be a LM maneuver,
      I assume, because we lost the service module,
      so no strain there.

[434742]
_page : 602
_tape : 
CC:  Affirm.

[434765]
_page : 603
_tape :

     a last item, we expect that it will take us
     about an hour to update your checklist and
     your time lines sometime later on today, and
     we'd just like you to consider that. I expect
     it'll be 3 or 4 hours before we have all that
     stuff ready.

[434792]
_page : 603

     represent Deltas from the launch stowage, and here
     comes the first list, LM to command module equip-
     ment transfer. First, DSEA, and I'll give you the

     lockon, which is going to improve our data flow
     here. Only thing is, we'll probably lose data
     and probably voice, too, during a portion of each

     is, if anyone has on any BIOMED, would you switch
     your switch to - your BIOMED switch to that
     position.

CDR: Vance, you might be interested - the way we're -
      the way we got this thing arranged, we have one
      helmet attached to the COMM lines attached to the
      LM hoses, and the guy that's got the duty wears
      the helmet, so the other people are free to
      maneuver.

[440388]

_tape : 
CC:  Jim, when you get finished moving your stowage
     around and it's convenient, we'd like to terminate
     the battery charge for a little while to bring up
     the CM TM so we can take a look at the temperatures
     again, like we did yesterday. Advise that right
     now on your batteries, you have 111 amp-hours;
     and, eventually, we hope to have them up - peaked
     up to about 116. One other point, we - we can
     either read that procedure up again which involves
     cranking up the telemetry, or, if Jack still has
     it, we can use his notes and - but I have one or
     two changes to - to make on them. Over.

[440771]
_page : 608
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, understand that you'll want us to terminate
      battery charge for a while, and crank up the CM
      TM to read out temperatures. And you have a few
      changes to Jack's checklist, and I'll turn the
      COMM over here to Jack shortly, as soon as he's
      finished, and we'll get along with it.

[440793]
_page : 608

     on it.

[441726]
_page : 609
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Vance. Jim said that you want to terminate
      battery charge on battery A.

[441733]
_page : 609
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirm, Jack. Request to - Before you
     terminate it, get the usual readout on voltage
     and current; and we'd also like a time of termi-
     nation, and understand you have the termination
     procedures. Is that affirm?

[441755]
_page : 609
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. That's affirm. Stand by. Let me just
      make sure I've got everything here before I go
      off on a tangent.

[441763]
_page : 609
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jack, and your battery-charge termination
     procedure remains unchanged, but when we go to
     power up the CM and look at your TM, we have a
     couple of additional steps.

[441803]
_page : 609
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Vance, I do have the procedure for stopping
      the battery charge. And do you want me to copy
      this procedure now, or do you want me to come back
      and give you the volt, amps, and time and - after
      I complete this termination?

[441827]
_page : 609
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Just - Just give us the volts and amps
     Just before you start the termination of the pro-
     cedure, and understand you say you have the
     charge - the procedure for taking the charge off.
     Is that affirm?

[441849]
_page : 609
_tape : 
CMP: That's affirm.

[441851]
_page : 609
_tape :

[441859]
_page : 609

     what; I could run through it very quickly Just
     to verify that we're getting started off on the
     correct path here.

[441871]
_page : 609
_tape :

      I have is panel BAT CHARGE to OFF on panel 3; AC

      INVERTER 2, OFF; panel 5: MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C
      ON; panel 250: CB BAT A POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING,
      open; panel 275: INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, open;
      and then, the - just to go ahead and reverse the
      position of the switches and circuit breakers
      that I started out with, and these don't have to
      be in reverse order. Is that Charlie?

[441912]

     been doing some spring housecleaning, moving
     stowage around up there.

[442060]
_page : 610

LMP: Boy, you wouldn't believe this LM right now; it's
      nothing but bags from floor to ceiling.

[442066]
_page : 610
_tape : 
CC:  Hey, that brings up a question. We were wondering
     where you guys plan to stow the probe and drogue?
     It occurred to us that one possibility was to stow
     it in the LM, down about where the LMP normally
     stands, underneath the IS - ISAer. Perhaps you
     have a better idea. Over.

[442092]
_page : 610
_tape : 
LMP: Yes, I do, Vance. ... would go in the LM, but I
      thought maybe we ought to stow it where the CDR
      stands. How's that?

[442102]
_page : 610
_tape :

     getting that one over because Jim Just got off

_tape : 
CC:  Okay, and - Hey, we just - we'll record that, and
     figure that you'll stow the probe and drogue over
     in the - where the CDR stands. We have a - a
     change to this - equipment transfer list that I
     just read up to Jim. Why don't you make a note
     of this one item? Forget about the LM - -

      until Jack gets done doing the battery charge?

[442164]
_page : 611
_tape :

[442179]
_page : 611
_tape : 
CC:  And, Fred, request PCM on LO bit rate, now.

[442184]
_page : 611
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. And there was one piece of flight data
      that we needed that we didn't bring along this
      time.

_tape : 
LMP: Yes.

[442288]
_page : 611

      the - secured the battery charge now.

[442304]
_page : 611
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, and we're recording the time that that was
     complete. You have two lists there, one is LM
     to CM equipment transfer and the second list is
     the reverse. Request you scratch the last item
     on the first list, which is returning used bags
     to the CM.

     the battery charge. Now if you are ready to copy,
     Jack, I would like to give you the two changes
     that we have to the powerup for the CM procedure.
     Over.

[442436]
_page : 612
_tape : 
CC:  Okay.

[442499]
_page : 612
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Vance. You say you have some changes in
      the procedures that I used before to get telemetry
      and to check out the CSM system?

[442507]
_page : 612
_tape : 
CC:  Yes, that's correct, Jack; they're pretty simple.
     About halfway through the procedure, we have a
     step on panel 3, which is POWER AMPL, HIGH; we'd
     like to change that to POWER AMPL, LOW.

[442529]
_page : 612
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Copy. POWER AMPL, LOW.

[442533]
_page : 612
_tape : 
CC:  And the next change, Jack, is panel 275. Scratch
     the step "CB MAIN B, BAT B, close - BAT BUS B,
     close."

[442550]
_page : 612
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. You want to delete the step "CB MAIN B,
      BAT BUS B, close."

[442555]
_page : 612
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. As you know, we're going to do this on
     LM power, so this reflects that.

[442564]
_page : 612
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Real fine.

[442567]
_page : 612
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, and have at it. We - we'd like to have the
     TM up for about 5 or 10 minutes to look at the
     data from the CM; look at your temperatures,
     et cetera. And after that, we'll go back to
     charging the battery again, and the charge will
     probably go until around GET 126.

[442587]
_page : 612
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Do you want the same readouts from me
      that I gave you before?

      	Page 606
      

[442594]
_page : 613
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirmative, Jack. And just to make sure
     that there is no mistaking the procedure, it
     starts out for the backout part: panel 3, POWER
     AMPL, OFF; TRANSPONDER, OFF; AC INVERTER 2, OFF;
     then goes to panel 250, et cetera.

      you - is on the stowage list where you have us
      putting the black-and-white TV camera on top of
      A-7 in an A ... decontamination bag, I was
      wondering if it would be possible or if you -
      there would be any problem in putting it into
      B-6 along with the two 70-millimeter Hasselblad
      cameras?

[442682]
_page : 613
_tape :

     if you can get it in, but let us get - work
     that and get back with you. Okay?

[442690]
_page : 613
_tape : 
CMP: All right. I was Just thinking. I'm trying to
      get as much weight as possible down there in that
      LEB. We have no SRCs and then our waste tank
      is - you know - rather depleted. I think it's
      about down to 40 percent or so. So I'm trying
      to get as much L over D as I can, and any heavy
      items we can get down there, I'd be greatly
      appreciative of you bringing it to our attention.

[442719]
_page : 613
_tape :

     on your last question.

      ured a Hasselblad with a 250, and I've got the
      lunar-surface number 1 Hasselblad, and I've got
      the lunar surface sequence camera, also, rigged
      and ready to go. Did you have any other druthers
      about the ...

[443666]
_page : 615

[443673]
_page : 615

     them, Fred. I think pretty soon we'll be shoot-
     ing them up to you to specify which cameras and
     settings. But that - that sounds pretty close.

[443690]
_page : 615
_tape : 
LMP: Okay, you might let them know that, if they hadn't
      thought of it, that we got this lunar-surface

      we are in good shape as far as water goes in

     during your service module photography. Over.

[448797]
_page : 622
_tape :

[448799]
_page : 622
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We have three cameras here, two of them
     to be used for picture taking from the LM, one
     to be used from the number 5 window of the CSM.
     First, I'll hit the LM cameras. And this camera
     that I mention now has first priority. It's
     considered the one to give you the best results.
     That's the 70-millimeter DC Reseau camera,
     Hasselblad, that is, with the 80-millimeter lens,
     from box A-13. Suggest fresh magazine of 3400
     black-and-white film.

[448862]
_page : 622
_tape : 
CDR: Okay.

[448866]
_page : 622
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Suggest either magazine R or magazine S
     from A-13. Transfer all of this to the LM and
     recommend the following settings: LM/DC/80/BW
     3400 (f:5.6 at a 250th).

[448920]
_page : 622
_tape : 
CC:  And that's all for that one.

[448924]
_page : 622
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Vance. Let me see if I have it here. For
      the LM, want to mse the 70-millimeter DC
      Hasselblad 80-millimeter lens in A-13, using
      3400 black-and-white film MAGs R or S. Prepare
      to take camera to the LM, and the setting would
      be the LM/DC/80/BW 3400 (f:5.6) at a 250th.

[448948]
_page : 622
_tape : 
CC:  That's correct. Okay. Next: the next camera -
     Stand by 1. I've got noise here. Okay. The
     next LM - The next camera for the LM will be the
     16-millimeter, and these photos are considered
     to be priority 3. Okay. One, get the
     16-millimeter DAC and powerpack from A-8. Get
     	Tape 83/8
     	Page 616
     
     the 10-millimeter lens, and remove it - remove
     the 10-millimeter lens, and take the 18-millimeter
     lens from B-3 and attach it to the camera. And
     attach the power cable transfer to the LM, set
     frame rate at 12 frames per second, and the same
     data line that I gave you before reads this way
     this time. LM/DAC/18/CEX, battery (f:8 and
     1/250th). Okay. Now looking at these two cameras
     in the LM, it's recommended that you use the
     16-millimeter for the first 2-1/2 minutes and
     then switch to the 70-millimeter. That's partly
     because the frame's been - or the - They've been
     optimized for closer and longer range. Okay.
     Read back, please.

[449099]
_page : 623
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Vance. Essentially, what you wanted to
      use as far as the movie camera in the LM goes,
      is our lunar sequence camera which is attached
      to the powerpack. We use the 18-millimeter lens,
      set it at 12 frames per second ... f:8 at 250th
      of a second.

[449122]
_page : 623
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. f:8 at 250th.

[449130]
_page : 623
_tape : 
CDR: Right; f:8 at 250th.

[449135]
_page : 623
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Would you believe that we have a correc-
     tion now to the last camera I gave you? Correct
     that 18-millimeter lens to 75-millimeter lens.

[449152]
_page : 623
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. The 18-millimeter to the 75-millimeter
      lens. Okay.

[449157]
_page : 623
_tape : 
CC:  Right. Okay. Next for the command module pic-
     tures, it may be a little hard to see the service
     module from the command module, but if you can
     see it, it will be through window 5, people down
     here think. Recommend for that the CM 70-
     millimeter. These photos have priority 2. So
     this is 70-millimeter EL, with - which has the
     80-millimeter attached, and this is all in B-3.
     Take off the 80-millimeter lens and attach the
     250-millimeter lens. And the 250-millimeter
     lens can be found in U-4. Use CEX film from
     A-13. Ring sight from A-7, and these pictures
     will be f:8 at a 250th. And I think probably
     by now you probably all have - already have
     these cameras configured, and this may be redun-
     dant information, but here it is anyway. Over.

_page : 624
_tape :

      almost configured like you said. For the command
      module, you think that the EL with the 250 lens,
      CEX film, f:8 at a 250th is the best bet, and
      you're saying now that where you think you'll see
      it is out window 5? Is that it?

      center window in view of the service module,

      photograph. Why do you think window 5 will be
      it?

     and, when you're docked, you have approximately
     a 60-degree angle between the Z-axes of the two
     spacecraft. It appears that peering out win-
     dow 5, you would be looking at the rendezvous
     radar on top of the LM which would, if you
     pitched, more or less give you a view of the
     service module. That is, if you pitched, so -
     from - and I think that this has been run by
     quite a few folks here; so, offhand, I can't see
     where any other window would be as good or per-

[451822]
_page : 627
_tape :

      the surge tank and get another shot of water,
      and was able to repressurize the surge tank okay,
      but there was no water that came out of the water

     don't know if you want to copy them or not.
     This is something I can just read off to you.

      get.

[452068]
_page : 627
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. I'll read them fast first here so you
     get a general idea. LM pad, service module
     JETT attitude, Moon viewing attitude, Sun
     viewing attitude, and LM JETT attitude. The
     CM pads are coarse aline angles for LM attitudes
     during Moon and Sun sightings, coarse aline
     angles for entry REFSMMAT, and CMC angles on
     entry REFSMMAT for LM JETT. Moon viewing, and
     entry. Okay. That - That's general pad infor-
     mation. If you want, I'll read it slowly so you
     can copy it all down; otherwise, I'll go ahead.

      module jettison attitude, Moon viewing attitude
      Sun viewing attitude, and LM jettison attitude.
      Is that correct?

[452144]
_page : 628
_tape :

     now, slowly. Coarse aline angles for LM attitudes
     during Moon and Sun sightings.

[452181]
_page : 628
_tape :

     that back.

[452257]

     in.

[452394]
_page : 628
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We lost you there briefly while you were
     in an attitude where we couldn't receive you.
     Jack, we'd like to hold off for about 5 minutes.
     We have some more people coming in to listen to
     this, and it took a lot of people to devise this
     procedure, and a few people have been testing it
     out, so we'd like to have them all on hand while
     we give you the rest.

      me?

[452624]
_page : 629

[452632]
_page : 629
_tape : 
CMP: Okay.

[452648]
_page : 629
_tape : 
CC:  Jack, probably - probably the thing to do is to
     give you all of the checklist, and it will
     include things like this. Then we'll have a
     big question and answer session afterwards, if
     that' s okay by you.

[452664]
_page : 629
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. That sounds good.

[452812]
_page : 629
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Vance. While we're waiting, just for
      your information, the command module has been
      stowed per your checklist with the exception of
      the two Hasselblad cameras.

[452831]
_page : 629
_tape : 
F: Roger. Got that, Jack.

[452842]
_page : 629
_tape : 
CMP: And the LM is pretty well stowed with the
      exception when we have yet to bring in the
      probe and the drogue.

[452851]
_page : 629
_tape : 
F: Roger. Got that.

[452875]
_page : 629
_tape : 
F: Relative to your water situation, Jack, we're
    going to have a pretty good hack on the LM here
    in the next few hours, and we anticipate letting
    you fill your own tanks before we transfer over,
    so you should be in reasonably good shape there.

[452892]
_page : 629
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. We have a number of juice bags all out
      and ready to go, and we tried to get the water
      out of the command module about 20 minutes ago
      and found out that the command module's potable
      tank was empty. So we have no bags made up now,
      so we're dependent on LM water, PLSS water.

[452919]
_page : 629
_tape : 
F: Roger. If you feel like trying the PLSS, that's
    all excess, and you might want to try that at
    any time. I'm sure it'll taste like PLSS but
    you might as well try it.

[453028]

_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Deke. Ail the windows in the command
      module are heavily coated with water right now.
      So I don't know what kind of pictures we'll get
      out of them, but I'm going to try and clean them
      off and do the best I can with the 250-millimeter
      lens on the Hasselblad.

[453047]
_page : 630

    stuff in the LM. We figure you've got a much
    better chance of getting it through there.

[453211]
_page : 630
_tape : 
CC:  Jack, before we start reading the procedure,
     we'd like - We find that BAT A is topped off
     and in great shape. Like to switch over and
     top off BAT B some more. Give it 2 more hours
     of charging. Have about a seven- or eight-step
     procedure here to give you, if you want to copy
     that. We tre switching before we start recording
     the entry procedures.

[453238]
_page : 630
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Stand by and let me get out my other
      checklist.

     Panel 3; BATTERY CHARGE to B. Advise; well,
     stand by. Jack, advise that we have a backout
     procedure for this, but we'll read that up to
     you later, in about 2 hours. And, also, that
     this procedure is a DELTA to your - the first
     battery charging procedure that we gave you.
     In other words, it's a DELTA from where you are
     right now.

      think it quite had stabilized. It was reading
      1.1 amps, 39.6 volts when I left up there.

_page : 633
_tape :

     there might be some overlap, but to make sure
     we're all on the same signal. We're starting
     off with a set of time line procedures that are
     going to give us - end up with the normal entry
     checklist. There will be some checklist changes
     into the book, but the bulk of what I have for
     you is the time line stuff. And it starts at
     6 hours and 30 minutes prior to EI and assumes
     that we're getting LM power to MAIN B in the
     command module. I think you already have the
     numbers for the LM pads and the comand module
     pads; I mean the types of pads we'll be giving
     you. And if you have a question on what they'll
     be doing or what they're for, I can go over
     those now or when we get through.

[454542]
_page : 633
_tape :

      we'll discuss it when we get everything copied,
      huh?

[454550]
_page : 633
_tape :

     you get ready to start this checklist, is to
     install lithium hydroxide canisters and to stow
     ORDEAL. On panel 8, we want to turn the
     FLOODLIGHTS to FIXED.

_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Ken. The COMM from you is awful weak -
      awful weak, I - I can't - it's CB EPS SENSOR
      UNIT. Say again, after that.

[455279]
_page : 638
_tape : 
CC:  All right, Jack. That's CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, DC,
     that's Delta Charlie, BUS A and B, closed.

[455296]
_page : 638
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, DC BUS A and B, close.
      And I'll give you the volts and amps.

[455307]
_page : 638
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, that's correct. Go ahead.

[455309]
_page : 638
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Volts are 39.1; amps, 1.5.

[455325]
_page : 638
_tape : 
CC: Okay. On panel 3: MAIN BUS A and B, go to
     RESET and leave it in the center.

[455346]
_page : 638
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, panel 3 - Stand by; got to change OMNI's.

[455359]
_page : 638
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. MAIN BUS A and B, RESET, then center.

[455367]
_page : 638
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay, now we're at EI
     minus 5 plus 05. And, as far as you're concerned,
     Jack, the command module is using this for infor-
     mation only. This will be the LM doing an Earth-
     terminator AGS alinement; and at the time of
     5 plus 05 is the time they'll be going ahead and
     releasing their ball. And this will be covered
     in the LM checklist; it'll be uplinked after this
     one. At EI minus 5, we perform midcourse num-
     ber 7. Over.

[455416]
_page : 638
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. At EI minus 05:05, the LM is making an
      Earth-terminator aline; and at EI minus 05:00,
      we perform MCC-7.

[455427]
_page : 638
_tape : 
CC:  That's correct. At the completion of mid-
     course 7, the LM will maneuver to a separation
     attitude. And this attitude will be sent up
     on one of the pads that you're going to get
     before all the sequence starts. And it'll be
     flown to the LM ball angles on that pad.

[455447]
_page : 638
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Understand.

[455450]
_page : 638
_tape : 
CC:  All right. At EI minus 4 plus 40, we want to
     perform page 1-6, step 39 of the entry checklist.
     	Tape 85/2
     	Page 632

[455467]
_page : 639
_tape : 
CMP: Ken, I - I didn't get it. We had to change
      OMNI's again. Could you say it - the EI minus
      4 dash - or 04:40, we do something.

[455475]
_page : 639
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. And at that time, you'll want to perform
     step 39 of page E/1-6. Over.

[455491]
_page : 639
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Perform step 39 of entry checklist
      page E/1-6.

[455499]
_page : 639
_tape : 
CC:  That's correct. Okay. The next is the command
     module RCS activation, and that's step 4-1 of
     page E/1-6.

[455533]
_page : 639
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. The next is perform CSM - or CM RCS acti-
      vation for step 4-1 of page E -- E/1-6.

[455548]
_page : 639
_tape : 
CC:  That's correct.

[455561]
_page : 639
_tape : 
CC: All right, Jack. The next is at EI minus 4
     plus 30. We want to verify that the LM is
     configured for command module RCS hotfire.

[455588]
_page : 639
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Verify LM configure for RCS hotfire at
      EI minus 04:30.

[455596]
_page : 639
_tape : 
CC:  That's correct. Now to panel 5: circuit
     breaker G&N IMU HEATER, MAIN B, closed.

[455621]
_page : 639
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Panel 5: CB G&N IMU HEATER, MAIN A and
      MAIN B, closed.

[455629]
_page : 639
_tape :

[455642]
_page : 639
_tape : 
CC:  I'm sorry; I lost you that time. Say it again.

[455648]
_page : 639
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Let's repeat it. Stand by. Cut out.
      We've really got a strange attitude, so this is
      why we are having the COMM problem. Panel 5:
      CB G&N IMU HEATER, MAIN B, closed.

[455664]
_page : 639

_tape : 
CMP: SCS, LOGIC POWER 2/3, ON, panel 7.

[455709]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirm. Back to panel 2: RCS COMMAND,
     ON.

[455720]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CMP: Panel 2: RCS COMMAND, ON.

[455725]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CC:  That's correct. Now the command module RCS
     check per step 4 of page E/2-1.

[455744]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Perform the command module RCS check per
      step 4, page 2-1.

[455749]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CC:  That's correct. Okay, at this point, we want to
     lock the rotation hand controllers.

[455769]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. AFter that, lock both rotation hand con-
      trollers.

[455774]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirm. On panel 8: SEQUENTIAL, PYRO
     ARM, two to ARM.

[455797]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Panel 8: set FYRO ARM, two, to ARM. Do
      I get a MSFN GO for that?

[455803]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CC: That's negative, Jack. We haven't powered up
     any of the downlink at this time. You'll be
     doing this and the command module RCS pressuri-
     zation both by yourself.

[455817]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CMP: Okay.

[455820]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Now, the next event is going to be the
     separation of the service module, and these are
     some LM steps, but so that you will know what is
     going on, I'll read them to you. The LM will do
     a LM plus-X of one-half foot per second. Then
     you'll be hitting the CM SM SEP on and up, on
     their command. As soon as we are free of the
     service module, the LM will do another LM
     minus-X for 0.5 feet per second. This is called
     the push-pull maneuver. I think it was described
     this afternoon.

[455866]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CMP: Yes, Ken. It was, I heard about it.

[455869]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. I just wanted you to know that's the
     sequence you're in. Okay. At the completion of
     that, we go back to panel 8, and it's SEQUENTIAL,
     PYRO ARM, both of them, to SAFE.

[455896]
_page : 640
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Panel 8: SEQ PYRO ARM, two, to SAFE.

[455908]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CC: Okay. And following this, we take SEQUENTIAL,
     LOGIC, two, to OFF.

[455923]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CMP: Okay. LOGIC, two, to OFF.

[455928]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CC:  I'm sorry, Jack. I'1] have to ask you to repeat
     that.

[455938]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CMP: Okay. Panel 8: SEQ LOGIC, two, to OFF. Are
      they ON now, Ken? I don't remember turning them -
      I guess that's part of one of the other sequences,
      huh? That we turned them ON?

[455948]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CC:  That's affirm. The reason we're turning the
     logic off, Jack, is a power savings. So we'll
     be turning them off, and I'll ge getting them
     back on when we go to get off of the LM; and
     then turn them back off, then we'll be turning
     them on prior to entry. Just so you know what's
     coming.

[455965]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CMP: Okay, real fine.

[455968]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CC:  Okay. Then following this, the LM will pitch up
     to acquire the Moon - Excuse me, they're going to
     pitch up and acquire the service module and photo-
     graph, and they'll be using the ACA for rotations
     from now on. And you may see the LM out of window
     number 5 at the same time they pitch up to acquire
     it.

[456002]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CMP: Okay. The LM pitches up, acquires the service
      module and photographs it, and I should expect
      to find - might possibly see the service module
      out of window 5.

[456012]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay, now we're down to EI
     minus 3 hours, or the next time-event, and the LM
     starts a maneuver to what we call the Moon-view
     attitude. This maneuver is designed to place
     the command module optics pointing with zero
     zero at the Moon, and it will be flown to on the
     LM ball angle.

[456057]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CMP: Okay, the LM maneuvers to the Moon-viewing atti-
      tude which would place the Moon in the center of
      the command module optics with them at zero zero.

[456068]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay, now we're going to
     panel 5, and it's circuit breaker G&N, COMPUTER,
     MAIN B, closed.

[456081]
_page : 641
_tape : 85/4
CMP: Okay. Panel 5: CB G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN B, closed.

[456095]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CC: That's affirmative. Now you're going to come
     up with a 37 ENTER 06 ENTER most likely on the
     computer. And what we want to do is to put the
     computer to standby; if you come up with a
     37 06, you'll have to do an ENTER in order to
     get the code 62. If it's got 62 on it, you can
     do a PROCEED until the DSKY blanks. You might
     remember that the AC is still off at this time
     so you won't be getting the STANDBY status light,
     and your cue that the computer is indeed in
     standby is when the DSKY goes blank.

[456136]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CMP: Okay. You're saying that I will probably get
      a PROGRAM 06 with a VERB 37 ENTER flashing.

[456147]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CC: I expect that you - -

[456148]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CMP: ENTER 06.

[456149]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CC:  I expect you are - -

[456150]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CMP: Say again, Ken.

[456152]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CC:  Yes. We think that you're going to come up
     with a 37 06 already in the DSKY. If you do,
     do an ENTER and that should take you to the
     code 00062, which is the request for standby.
     And when you get that, hit PROCEED until the
     DSKY blanks. If you come up with something
     else, that's where we want to end up anyhow.
     With either, when you get the code 62 when it
     comes up, just do a PROCEED on it.

[456185]
_page : 642
_tape : 85/5
CMP: Okay. Is there anything else I could get?

[456192]
_page : 642

     had the LM powering MAIN B, and we've had all
     these particular loads on it, and we're getting
     ready to secure LM power so we wanted to make

     by a clock increment, a state vector; they'll
     give you a VERB 66; they'll give you two
     REFSMMATs, there'll be an actual and a preferred;

     do will be to set the mission timer and what
     we've done is to only turn on the mission timer
     on the MDC. And you'll probably have to wait here
     until they get through with the uplink so you can 
     have the computer.

[457210]

CMP: Okay. Set it from the, CHC, huh?

[457213]
_page : 647
_tape : 85/10
CC:  That's affirm. Okay. Now, we are getting
     ready to start the alinement sequence, and are
     you familiar with the general sequence of events
     we're going to use, Jack?

[457229]
_page : 647
_tape : 85/10
CMP: How do you mean? We are going to make an aline-
      ment on the Moon and on the Sun; other than that -
      I didn't get any - I wasn't on the headset when
      the general information was passed up, so if
      there was any more than that, I didn't get it.

[457245]
_page : 648
_tape : 85/11
CC: Okay. Basically, that is correct. Let me just
     run through it hand-waving-type for a minute,
     and then I'll read you the steps. I think it
     will make more sense. The scheme is that the
     LM can fly to a set of ball angles that will
     point your optics at the Moon. Now, at any time,
     in any attitude that we happen to be at, if
     you can look in the telescope and recognize star
     patterns sufficient that you believe you can
     make an alinement all on your own, that's the
     place we'd like to break off and let you go ahead
     and take over with your own alinement. However,
     we are giving you a procedure which will give you
     things we know you can see in the telescope with-
     out worrying about any reflections or anything
     of that nature, and it's not intended that this
     procedure has to be followed past the point where
     you know you've got good definition of star
     patterns in your telescope. If you need to go
     on, we'll maneuver, take a look at the Moon,
     we'll take a mark there, and then we'll maneuver
     with the LM/FDAI angles again and take a look at
     the Sun, and get yourself another mark on the
     Sun and that will complete the alinement. Now,
     the alinement scheme is that we are going to give
     you a set of angles that you can coarse aline the
     ball through when the LM is pointing you at the
     Moon. Now, this set of angles will agree with
     the REFSMMAT that you have in as a nominal
     REFSMMAT in you CMC. You can coarse aline to that,
     set a drift flag and EEFSMMAT flag, and you'll
     have a good platform and we'll be within a
     couple of degrees of a good alinement. And, if
     we have to, we could break off at this point and
     go ahead with an entry; however, in an attempt
     to get a good platform, we are going to have you
     then do a P52 option 1, and what you are going to
     find in the option 1 slots in the entry REFSMMAT.
     You'll come up with the NOUN 22 values, and we
     intend to go ahead and coarse aline the ball to
     the entry REFSMMAT attitude, and then we'll go
     ahead and take marks through a normal P52
     sequence. So that's the general scheme that
     we are going to use. If you think you have a
     handle on that, I will go ahead and read you
     the steps.

[457391]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: Okay. Well, let me ask a question. The LM
      maneuvers to a set of Moon-viewing angles. Okay,
      at this time, I am going to do a P52, is that
      right? With the planet option?

[457409]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  The first thing we arc going to do is to coarse
     aline the platform and get it inertial, based on
     the REFSMMAT that you have in the present slot
     inside the CMC. We'll then go - and do a P52,
     option 4 - Correction, option 1.

[457428]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: Okay - That's after the LM gets established at
      the attitude. Jim says I'm here at the Moon-
      viewing attitude, I do a VERB 41 NOUN 20 to the
      set of angles that you're going to give me in
      the pad.

[457440]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  That's affirmative - -

[457441]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: And then I enter the P52.

[457443]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  That's correct.

[457444]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: Okay. Then enter the P52 and that's an
      option 3, right?

[457451]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  The P52 will be done as an option 1. The only
     reason you have the other REFSMMAT inside the
     computer is that in order to set the REFSMMAT
     flag, you need some relative orientation.

[457462]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: Okay. I see. I do a P52 option 1, and when do
      I set the REFSMMAT flag and the drift flag?

[457473]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  That will be before entering P52. I am going to
     give you this procedure in detail.

[457478]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: Okay. All right. Let's go at it. Maybe it'll
      all fall out and I won't have any questions.
      Go ahead.

[457485]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  Okay. I'm ready to start reading again. We
     start with a VERB 41 NOUN 20.

[457508]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CMP: Okay. When the LM is in the Moon-viewing attitude,
      I do a VERB 41 NOUN 20, ENTER.

[457514]
_page : 649
_tape : 85/12
CC:  That's right. And you'll put in the attitudes
     that you'll get from one of the pads, and this
     will be for the coarse aline angles when the LM
     is at the Moon-viewing attitude. Then when
     they're all squared away, I tell you they have
     the right attitude; we then pick up again with
     a VERB 40 NOUN 20, ENTER.

[457545]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CMP: Okay. VERB 40 NOUN 20, ENTER when Moon is -
      the LM is satisfied that they're at the Moon-
      viewing attitude.

[457553]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CC:  That's correct. Now we're going to set the
     REFSMMAT and drift flags according to the G&C
     checklist, page G/7-1, steps 3 and 4.

[457575]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13

      steps 3 and 4.

[457580]

     option 1.

[457593]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CMP: VERB 37, ENTER; 52, ENTER; option 1.

_tape : 85/13
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay. When that's complete,
     the LM will maneuver to the Sun-viewing angle
     for attitude. And when they get there, you take
     a mark on the Sun using the Sun filter and the
     telescope; and, again, we're marking on the
     center.

[457659]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CMP: Okay. Now, let me ask you a question. Is the
      first mark on the Moon made with the - are all
      these made with the telescope and not the
      sextant?

[457669]
_page : 650
_tape : 85/13
CC:  If - I'm not sure right offhand what the angular
     size of the Moon is, Jack. If you can get it in
     the sextant; that's the best thing to do, but
     you may have to go into the telescope in order
     to define the center. Either one's acceptable.

[457684]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: Okay. If I can define the center through the
      sextant, do it that way. And if I can't, use
      the telescope.

[457690]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  That's affirmed. We know you're going to use
     the telescope on the Sun.

[457703]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  Okay. You ready to press on?

[457709]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: I'm ready.

[457710]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  Okay. Just reminded we owe somebody a BAT B
     voltage.

[457717]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: Okay, another volts ard amps coming up.

[457720]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  All right. Thank you. And this left us in P52
     with two marks, and we'll go ahead and torque
     the NOUN 93s.

[457743]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: Okay. ... torque the NOUN 93s, after the two
      marks.

[457748]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  Okay. So that gives us a good platform. Now
     the LM will maneuver to the jettison attitude,
     and the only thing of significance here is that
     you want to watch to make sure that the path
     they choose to go to the Jettison attitude
     avoids gimbal lock on your own platform.

[457778]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: Okay. The LM maneuvers to the jettison attitude
      and I just monitor the maneuver and yell at Jim
      if he gets near a gimbal lock.

[457786]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  That's affirmed. Okay, and then the LM will go
     to a MAX deadband attitude hold in the jettiscn
     attitude.

[457804]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: Okay. The LM goes to MAX deadband attitude hold.

[457809]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  Okay. Now we're ready to go back to work. The
     next thing we'll do is to continue to powerup
     procedures. Do you have any further questions
     on that alinement, Jack?

[457818]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CMP: No. No. I think - I think it's all self-
      explanatory now.

[457823]
_page : 651
_tape : 85/14
CC:  Okay. The one thing that everybody would like
     for you to understand is we certainly don't
     insist on using the Moon and the Earth; if you
     find you have good stars, why use them. However,
     this alinement is more than adequate te give us
     a good guided entry.

[457840]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: Okay. If I get a set of good stars, do I start
      right out to a basic P51 and a P52 option 1?

[457850]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  That's affirmative.

[457853]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: Okay.

[457855]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  Okay. Now, we're ready to go to work on
     panel 275. And it starts with a circuit breaker
     MAIN A - -

[457861]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: Wait - wait just a minute. Wait just a minute.
      I owe you some volts and amps.

[457866]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  Okay. Ail right.

[457869]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: Okay. Volts are 39.4, amps, 1.25.

[457875]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  Okay. I thought maybe, your meter was stuck
     before.

[457880]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: No (laughter).

[457884]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  All right. You ready to go back to 275? Have
     a circuit breaker MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed.

[457902]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: CB MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed.

[457905]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  That's correct. And circuit breaker MAIN B,
     BAT C, closed.

[457917]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: CB MAIN Baker, BAT Charlie, closed.

[457920]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  Okay. That's correct. Now we're up to EI
     minus 1 plus 30. And at this time, we're going
     to proceed with the closeout and hatch installa-
     tion.

[457950]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CMP: Okay. Closeout and hatch installation at EI
      minus 01:30.

[457955]
_page : 652
_tape : 85/15
CC:  That's right, Jack, and we're going to close the
     IM hatch, and we'll make the dump valve in the
     LM hatch closed.

[457971]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: Understand you're going to close tile dump valve,
      now on the LM hatch, right?

[457976]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  That's correct.

[457977]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: Okay. This is a change from what we had under-
      stood previously.

[457981]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  That's correct.

[457983]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: I'm - Personally, I'm happy to see it, but that's
      good.

[457986]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  Okay. That's one vote on your side. Okay; and
     we're going to go ahead and do the - use the
     decal to perform the hatch installation, and
     we'll start on the hatch integrity check.

[458019]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: Okay. Per the decal, perform the hatch installa-
      tion and start on the hatch integrity check.

[458029]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  That's correct.

[458033]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: Okay, Ken. One thing I think that - I don't
      know whether anybody - the decal don't take into
      account the fact that we still have the umbili-
      cals connected. At what point in time should
      they be removed?

[458050]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  Okay, Jack. That doesn't matter. We're going
     to be separating the tunnel upstream of those
     umbilicals, and you can leave them right there.

[458064]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: Okay. Does it make any difference if we
      disengage - the LM - We have pulled the circuit
      breakers LM POWER-1 aad -2, so if we choose to
      disconnect these umbilicals, there's no harm,
      right?

[458081]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  That's right. No sweat. John Aaron's just
     saying that they may he hot. He's checking on
     it, so how about holding a decision on that and
     let me come back to you?

[458094]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CMP: Okay.

[458099]
_page : 653
_tape : 85/16
CC:  Okay. And let me tell you what we're going to
     do since we told you a different story this
     afternoon on this tunnel. We're actually going
     to vent the tunnel down so that we end up with
     about 1-1/2 to 2 psi absolute in the tunnel.
     And this will give us a DELTA-P of 3. So we'll
     do our hatch integrity check at the same time
     we're venting the tunnel down.

[458124]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: Okay. It sounds good.

[458126]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  Okay. Now let me give you some plumbing switches
     here. Let's take the SURGE TANK OXYGEN valve
     to ON.

[458145]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: SURGE TANK 0<sub>2</sub> to ON.

[458148]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  All right. Take the MAIN REGs, two, OPEN.

[458159]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: MAIN REGs, two, to OPEN.

[458162]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  Okay. And the WATER AND GLYCOL TANK PRESSURE,
     the PRESSURE valve and the RELIEF valve to BOTH.

[458180]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: Okay, WATER AND GLYCOL TANKS PRESSURE and RELIEF
      valve to BOTH.

[458186]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  That's correct. And EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE
     valve to BOTH.

[458200]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE to BOTH.

[458203]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  That's correct; and the SUIT DEMAND REGs to BOTH.

[458215]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: SUIT DEMAND REGs to BOTH.

[458218]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  That's correct. Okay, now we're going to
     panel 5: circuit breaker ECS TRANSDUCERs, PRES-
     SURE GROUP 1 and 2, MAIN A and MAIN B. That's
     four circuit breakers, closed.

[458246]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: ECS TRANSDUCERs, GROUP 1 and 2, MAIN A and
      MAIN B, four, to close.

[458252]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  That's correct. Okay, now. Circuit breaker
     ECS TRANSDUCER, TEMPERATURE, MAIN A and MAIN B,
     that's two of them, closed.

[458271]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: CB ECS TRANSDUCER, TEMPERATURE, MAIN A and
      MAIN B, closed.

[458277]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CC:  That's correct. On panel 4: PRIMARY ECS
     GLYCOL PUMPS, one, to AC 1.

[458293]
_page : 654
_tape : 85/17
CMP: Primary ECS GLYCOL PUMPS to 1, AC1.

[458297]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  That's correct. Okay, then we'll finish going
     back to the tunnel vent, and verify the LM/CM
     DELTA-P and make sure it's been holding pres-
     sure. And we'll come back again and rehash all
     of the hatch integrity check and tunnel vent
     procedures with you. The next thing I want to
     read off is the EI minus 1 plus 20. We'll go to
     panel 7: BMAG number 1 POWER to WARM UP.

[458351]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: BMAG number 1 POWER to WARM UP.

[458355]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  That's correct. Then at EI minus 1 plus 10, we'll
     perform SCS powerup per checklist, page G/2-4.

[458375]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: Okay. Perform SCS powerup per G&C checklist,
      page 2-4.

[458382]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  That's correct. Okay, on panel 4: SUIT COMPRES-
     SOR NUMBER 2 to AC1.

[458398]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: SUIT COMPRESSOR 2 to IC1.

[458401]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  That's correct. SPACECRAFT CONTROL to SCS.

[458420]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: SPACECRAFT CONTROL to SCS.

[458423]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  Okay. And your MANUALK ATTITUDE switches, as you
     desire. We're coming up on jettison of the LM,
     so that's just like separation.

[458442]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: Okay.

[458444]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  Okay. And we'll do a GDC aline.

[458461]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: Okay. Perform a GDC aline.

[458463]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  Okay. On panel 8: ROTATION CONTROL POWER,
     DIRECT, 1 and 2, MAIN A/MAIN B.

[458489]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: Okay. These are circuit breakers, ROTATION
      CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, 1 and 2, MAIN A and
      MAIN B, closed.

[458502]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CC:  Okay, Jack. I was thinking switch. Let me
     verify that's a circuit breaker, too. I think
     we have to get both of them.

[458512]
_page : 655
_tape : 85/18
CMP: Okay, there's those four circuit breakers over
      there, Ken. When you said panel 8, that's what
      I thought you were talking about. I don't
      think the circuit breakers are out right now,
      	Tape 85/29
      	Page 659
      
      things is during the platform-alinement period,
      when you're getting ready to close out the LM
      and then once you get into the command module and
      jettison the LM, why you're back on a very com-
      fortable time. And, of course, we'll be watching
      and anything we can do, like keeping track of
      time for you, we'll remind you of that as we go
      along.

[460156]
_page : 666
_tape : 
CMP: Hey, that would be good - that would be good,
      Ken.

[460162]
_page : 666
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Let me emphasize, Jack, that 2-1/2 hours
     is the earliest time we can start in on that
     powerup stuff. Everything else you can do the
     way you normally would, where you get as far
     ahead of the game as you can. But the 2-1/2-
     hour time is based on saving command module con-
     sumables. And if you do that, why we're fat;
     we've got plenty of time to give you some fans
     on the water even. So that's the one point you
     don't want to start early on. I do have a
     couple of more lines to run through on the entry
     checklist and two pages in the G&C. And I think
     that will clean us up.

[460214]
_page : 666
_tape : 
CMP: Okay, Ken. And G&C checklist now?

[460217]
_page : 666
_tape : 
CC:  Let me finish a couple more things in the entry
     book. You still got that?

[460223]
_page : 666
_tape : 
CMP: Yes. Go ahead.

[460224]
_page : 666
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. On - These are just cleanup items, Jack.
     On page 2-3, it lists now you separate, from the
     CM/SM SEP and all that, so, obviously, if we're
     on step 5 at 43 minutes down - that's all deleted.
     And that gets deleted all the way over onto
     page 2-4, up to the line where it says "15 min-
     utes.'' And at that point, we pick back up and
     everything. From 15 minutes down is valid.

[460267]
_page : 666
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Delete item 5 down to the point where it
      says "Minus 15 minutes."

[460274]
_page : 666
_tape : 
CC:  That's correct, Jack. Okay, on page 2-5. The
     top line where we had "Horizon check," that's
     now the "Moonset check" and the time is approxi-
     mately 57:37. And that's minus 02:23. And that
     angle that's listed in the book there - 177 -
     that's really a horizon time at 2 minutes; we'll
     	Tape 85/30
     	Page 660
     
     have you - can look that up on the back of your
     entry cue card, and I'll look that number up
     again for you tonight.

[460320]
_page : 667
_tape : 
CMP: Okay.

[460321]
_page : 667
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Another thing is to remember when we begin
     blackout, which is around 05g, and you can write
     this in your checklist wherever it's convenient;
     once we've lost COMM, we're going to go ahead and
     power down the SCE POWER OFF and the PMP POWER
     OFF. And we just want to do that after you lose
     COMM, which comes up around EI. Any time after
     that, go ahead and secure the PMP and the SCE
     power.

[460362]
_page : 667
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. When COMM is lost, SCE POWER OFF, PMP
      POWER OFF.

[460367]
_page : 667
_tape : 
CC:  That's correct, Jack, and that completes the
     entry checklist. Let's look at the G&C book.

[460386]
_page : 667
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Ready to copy.

[460388]
_page : 667
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Let's go to page 2-1.

[460405]
_page : 667
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[460407]
_page : 667
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jack. The second line under "IMU powerup"
     says "FDAI POWER to BOTH," and we're going to
     make that a "1." The reason we're doing that
     is, again, to conserve power. There's no reason
     to drive the second FDAI before we get that
     information to put on it.

[460428]
_page : 667
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. "FDAI POWER to 1."

[460433]
_page : 667
_tape : 
CC:  All right. That's correct. On page 2-2.

[460446]
_page : 667
_tape : 
CMP: Go ahead.

[460447]
_page : 667
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Under CMC powerup, line - or step 2 says
     "Flashing 3700, ENTER." The time we're going to
     use this, Jack, is going to be when you've just
     brought the computer up and it has a state vector
     in it that's way back many, many hours ago. So
     we want to do a VERB 96, ENTER to stop the inte-
     gration to keep it from just sitting there
     ambling along. And when the ground gives you a
     new state vector, why then we can go through P00
     and we'll be back in business.
     	Tape 85/31
     	Page 661
     

[460483]
_page : 668
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. You want me to go to VERB 37, ENTER; 00,
      ENTER; and then do a VERB 96?

[460495]
_page : 668
_tape : 
CC: When you come up, I guess you're going to - once
     you get the CMC powered up, you're probably going
     to be going - you're going to come up in a flash-
     ing 37, and if you'll just do a VERB 96, ENTER
     right there, that will take care of it.

[460508]
_page : 668
_tape : 
CMP: Okay.

[460509]
_page : 668
_tape : 
CC:  All right. And the last one I have for you is
     on page 2-4.

[460523]
_page : 668
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[460524]
_page : 668
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Under the SCS powerup, the first line
     says "AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, to OFF." Okay. You
     can just delete that part. On the fifth line,
     it says "Circuit breaker SCS LOGIC POWER," that's
     really "LOGIC BUS, four of them, to closed."
     The DELTA-V CG is not important since we are not
     burning the engine. The "SIGNAL CONDITIONER/
     DRIVER BIAS POWER" lists "Two to AC 1." We are
     going to make that just one of them; make it
     "SIGNAL CONDITION/DRIVER BIAS POWER, one, to
     AC 1." The "BMAG POWER," which is the third
     line from the bottom, says "BMAG POWER, two, ON;"
     we are going to make that just one. We'll bring
     up number 1, and we'll make "FDAI POWER, num-
     ber 1" and the last line "AUTO RCS SELECT, 16,
     enable," you can strike that off and replace it
     with "BMAG MODE, three of them, to RATE 1." You
     want to try reading that back?

[460618]
_page : 668
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Delete "AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, OFF." Change

     check on this hatch and integrity check maybe
     I can tell you something about that. And I do
     have an answer to your LM power question about
     the umbilicals. The umbilicals will be unpowered

[460723]
_page : 669
_tape :

     is say BATTERY CHARGE OFF at the moment. We'll
     complete that procedure as soon as you are
     through with Ken completely.

[460741]

     after that.

[460753]
_page : 669
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jack. It looks like we've closed up the
     loose ends here. Amazingly enough, out of all
     that stuff, it looks like we only generated one
     question on the floor, and we'll research that
     one. We'll even let you guess what it might
     have been. If you have any questions, after you
     mull it over, why, we're always available. Just
     ask us what you're thinking about.

[460840]
_page : 669

      going to wait until the LM people get theirs,
      	Tape 85/33

      and then we're going to discuss it and coordinate
      things here, and make sure that - that we don't
      have any interface problems. And, if we have any
      more questions, we'll be coming back at you.

     we just gave you. The first is near the front
     at EI - in the section under "EI minus 2-1/2 hours,"
     power removal from CM LM umbilical." We'll let
     you turn to that.

[466124]

      removal CM LM umbilical."

[466129]
_page : 693
_tape : 
CC: Okay. Under LM, we have a step, BAT 2, LOW
     VOLTAGE, 0FF/RESET, than ON. Next we have a
     step BAT 2, HI VOLTAGE. OFF/RESET, then ON. We
     request that you wait in between these two steps
     for us to give you a GO. In other words, we'd
     like to look and see that all the relays closed
     and all that sort of thing before you throw BAT 2,
     HI VOLTACE, to OFF/RESET, and ON.

[466173]
_page : 693

      then ON, I'll wait for a MSFN GO before proceeding.

_page : 693
_tape :

     "EI minus 1 hour and 45 minutes" - No, change
     that. Correction, "EI minus 1 hour, 35 minutes,"
     refer to the ECS section, and we have a change.

[466217]
_page : 693
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim's right. We should cross out all this
     stuff with a couple of exceptions. FORWARD DUMP
     valve, closed, the first step, should remain.
     Ail other steps should be scratched, except for
     the last one, which is OVERHEAD DUMP valve, closed.
     That leaves two steps.

[466245]
_page : 693
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Under ECS, we delete all except the first
      step, FORWARD DUMP valeve, close, and step 10,

     give you a little more time in there. What we've
     decided to do with it is wait until after EI minus 1,
     just before you initialize the EMS. If you have
     time, and only if you have time, do the EMS entry
     check. Otherwise, forget it and go right on into
     EMS initialization. You understand?

[477289]
_page : 697
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. You're going to delete between 2 hours and
      30 minutes and 02:15 there, and you're going to
      add it, if there is time, only if there is time,
      at EI minus 1 hour where the EMS initialization
      occurs .

[477311]
_page : 697
_tape :

     One other item. Just before EI minus 2 hours
     and 15 minutes, we need an E-memory dump
     VERB 74 ENTER. Over.

[477384]
_page : 697
_tape :

      I do a VERB 74. Right?

[477394]
_page : 697

      cold to sleep.

[477487]
_page : 698

[477541]

      comparing Jim's checklist with my own, I find

[477665]
_page : 699
_tape : 
CC:  Hey, Jack. The LM checklist is just for information to Jim.
     It's just to tell him that - that
     you're changing back to command module power.
     Your checklist is correct. Over.

[477680]
_page : 699
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. And when do you figure that you'll be
      sending up the pads that you have?

[477842]
_page : 699
_tape : 
CC:  Aquarius, all of your pads will be coming up in
     about 3-1/2 hours, at EI minus 06:30. And one
     thing we want to remind you of, when you remove
     power from the command module LM umbilical, is
     to be sure that you open the LM POWER MAIN B
     circuit breakers, both of them, before you start
     throwing switches and circuit breakers in the
     LM. Do it as we've outlined it in the procedure,
     in that order. Over.

[477873]
_page : 699
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. That's the way we planned on it. We'll
      let Jack do his three and then he'll tell us
      when we're GO from there. What pages are those
      changes on?

[477888]
_page : 699
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Fred. The one I've got for you is at the
     end of power removal from the command module LM
     umbilical. And just for your information, after
     you go through that entire procedure and about
     the time you're ready to transfer to the command
     module, at that time, power will be removed from
     the umbilical, and it's okay to disconnect it.
     That is, after you've thrown the switches in the
     LM. Is that clear?

[477921]
_page : 699
_tape : 
LMP: Roger. That's where I've got a remark here to
      check with you to see if it's all right to proceed.

[477928]
_page : 699
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. And that would be just after, on panel 16,
     you opening ASCENT ECA CONTROL breakers.

[477942]
_page : 699
_tape : 
LMP: Which step number is that?

[477963]
_page : 699
_tape : 
LMP: The confusing thing is, Jack, where they told
      me to wait for MSFN GC before proceeding was
      that BAT 2 LOW VOLTS OFF/RESET, then ON.

[477972]
_page : 699
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. That's still affirmative. We'll give you
     a go after waiting 5 seconds, and then down from
     there just a few steps, after you have opened
     the ASCENT ECA CONTROL breakers on panel 16, at that point, the
     umbilical is now powered, and it's okay to disconnect them should
     you care to do so.
     	Tape 89/2
     	Page 693

[477995]
_page : 700
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. After the last step then, I'm free to
      disconnect.

[477999]
_page : 700
_tape : 
CC:  Right. And one other change we have is, shortly
     after that, where we're configuring for jettison,
     we have closed both the FORWARD DUMP valve and
     the OVERHEAD DUMP valve. And we don't want to
     get in a locked up position like that, so one
     way to get around it is to - After we close the
     FORWARD DUMP valve, turn the DESCENT OXYGEN valve
     off. Over.

[478037]
_page : 700
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. After the FORWARD DUMP valve, add a step
      in that says the DESCENT OX valve, off.

[478051]
_page : 700
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Fred. That concludes the DELTAs. And
     perhaps you heard that our GAMMAs are still
     minus 6.03 and our DELTA-V will be a 2.8-foot-
     per-second RCS burn.

[478066]
_page : 700
_tape : 
LMP: Roger.

[478103]
_page : 700
_tape : 
CC:  Fred-o, we've got one more change we'd like to
     give you to clarify a question that Jack asked
     earlier. At EI minus 02'30 - -

[478115]
_page : 700
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Hold on a minute, Jack. I meant to call
      Jack back down. I'm not familiar with the pre-
      vious discussion.

[478122]
_page : 700
_tape : 
CC:  Negative. This is on your checklist.

[478127]
_page : 700
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[478129]
_page : 700
_tape : 
CC: At E mi - EI minus 02:30, during power removal
     from the umbilical, first thing we do is two
     steps with the CSM. We open the MAIN B, the LM
     POWER to MAIN B circuit breakers, and then there's
     a third step which says "Circuit breaker EPS
     SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open." Just delete that
     step. Over.

[478158]
_page : 700
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Delete the third step.

[478238]
_page : 700
_tape : 
CC:  And, Aquarius, for your information, as far as
     our water supply is concerned, including our
     plans for powerup, we have an additional 18 hours of water
     remaining from this point.

_page : 701
_tape :

[478292]
_page : 701
_tape : 
CDR: Okay, Jack. This is Jim. I just want to make
      sure that you're filtering the changes to the
      checklist that come up to make sure that they're
      absolutely essential. When we learn our pro-
      cedures, we can only do it one time, and we can't
      make changes at the last minute. We'd like to
      do the best, the safest way possible, but unless
      the changes are really essential, don't bother
      sending them up.

[478317]
_page : 701
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. We won't. The chairman of the CPCB is
     still active, and one thing we're trying to do
     is to save you all the time we can between EI
     minus 02:30 and 1 hour.

[478330]
_page : 701
_tape : 
CDR: That's affirm. That's a real important time.

[478334]
_page : 701
_tape : 
F: Yes. For your information, Jim, I don't know
    whether you heard that originally, but that
    time from 2-1/2 to 1 in there has been run
    about three times, and it's pretty tight, so
    we've tried to weed out what we could, which
    isn't much, but I think the other message you
    might impress on Jack when you get around to
    alining that platform, don't try to get it
    down too neat. It doesn't have to be all
    that good. Just do a nice quick and dirty
    one, and that's going to be good enough anyway.

[478363]
_page : 701
_tape : 
CDR: I concur. I think for reentry we don't have
      to have a real accurate platform, but I haven't
      told Jack that.

[478370]
_page : 701
_tape : 
F: Roger. Hey, Jim, while you're up and things
    are nice and quiet, let me give you a couple of
    other things to think about. One specifically.
    I know none of you are sleeping worth a damn
    because it's so cold, and you might want to
    dig out the medical kit there around 01:35 or
    in that ballpark, and pull out a couple of
    Dexedrines apiece and try one about then, and
    another around 01:39 to 01:40.
    	Tape 89/4
    	Page 695

[478395]
_page : 702
_tape : 
CDR: Well, I hadn't brought that up. We might -
      We might consider it.

[478397]
_page : 702
_tape : 
F: Okay.

[478419]
_page : 702
_tape : 
F: Wish we could figure a way to get a hot cup of
    coffee up to you. It'd probably taste pretty
    good about now, wouldn't it?

[478426]
_page : 702
_tape : 
CDR: Yes, it sure Would. You don't realize how cold
      this thing becomes when it's in a PTC mode that's
      slowing down, and I just clocked the cycles on
      my ... And it's about 11 to 12 minutes now, and
      the Sun is directly overhead, so it's shining on
      the engine bell of the service module and not
      getting down to the spacecraft at all.

[478456]
_page : 702
_tape : 
F: Hang in there. It won't be long now.

[478459]
_page : 702
_tape : 
CDR: Yes. That's right. As a matter of fact, doing
      this alignment on the Earth this time will be
      like making a landing with a fogged-up windshield.

[480113]
_page : 702
_tape : 
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[480126]
_page : 702
_tape : 
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[480128]
_page : 702
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Skipper. We figured out a way for you to
     keep warm. We decided to start powering you up
     now, and what we want you to do - what we want
     you to do is take your entry LM PREP checklist
     and start at the top where it says "BAT 5 NORMAL
     FEED on," and then jump over as it says to your
     30-minute activation, and do all of the 30-minute
     activation up to, but not including, the burn.
     You copy?

[480172]
_page : 702
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. If I understand you correctly, then that
      gives me leeway to mareuver when we get up to
      activation complete, and we can be in position
      for the burn, but we will not burn. We don't
      have a pad anyway.

[480195]
_page : 702
_tape : 
CC:  That's affirm, Jim. You could maneuver to burn
     attitude, or you could maneuver to an attitude
     which should put the Sun in the windows to warm
     the place up.

[480203]
_page : 702
_tape :

      electrical power to do this?
      	Tape 89/5

[480209]
_page : 703
_tape :

     to do it. I can get you a number, though.

[480217]
_page : 703

[480643]
_page : 703
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Question. This short turnon step 3 on
      page 24 has us only turning on the RCS SYSTEM
      A/B, two quads, and tbe breakers are still out
      on panel 11. Did you want those in, too, or
      are we just going to use one set of heaters?

[480662]

_tape : 
CC:  Stand by.

[480692]
_page : 703
_tape :

     mends for now. When you get into the circuit
     breaker panel configuration, you're going to

[488301]
_page : 712
_tape : 
CC: Aquarius, Houston. We think we've figured out
     a way to save you some time at a very critical --
     very full schedule. And that's by doing a
     docked coarse aline, since we got the LM up now.
     That would save you a maneuver or two.

[488378]
_page : 712
_tape :

      coarse aline might be quicker for - for Jack.

[488385]
_page : 712
_tape : 
CC:  Yes. We think it would be, and it'd save quite
     a bit of time at a place where you're going to
     be pretty busy. Also save you some petrol.

[488396]
_page : 712
_tape :

[488413]
_page : 712
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. We're looking at doing this in the
     service module SEP attitude, and the optics will
     be pointed away from the Sun. So it should be a
     good attitude for a P52.

[488434]
_page : 712
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. So, we'll be going to the service module
      SEP attitude, at which time we'll do a docked
      coarse aline, and -

[488454]
_page : 712
_tape : 
CDR: Then you want - You want Jack then to do a P527

[488480]
_page : 712
_tape : 
CC:  The way we'll do that in our time line Jim, is
     to go ahead and do the service module JETT and
     then we'll just stay in that attitude and when
     it comes time in our time line as we've outlined,
     to bring the platform up, we'll proceed with the
     P52 - coarse aline, and then the P52.

[488500]
_page : 712
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Are we going to use the same techniques
      that we normally do for LM activation? In other
      words, I try to maintain an attitude, smd give
      him some angles and then - Are you going to give
      him the angles? Then he does the 52.

[488517]

     comes time to power up the CMC, and we'll get

     good stars to give you a fine aline with, and it
     looks like we can pick some stars that are looking
     away from the Sun in which you can find in that

_page : 716
_tape : 
LMP: Say again, Joe.

[490114]
_page : 716
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, Fred. I have a service module SEP pad with
     the attitudes. You don't need a pad sheet for it;
     just any old blank sheet will do.

[490129]
_page : 716
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. I was going to say I don't - We don't hardly
      carry a service module SEP pad.

_tape : 
LMP: Okay. I'm using a P27 here. Go ahead.

[490146]
_page : 716
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. The pad reads as follows and then I'll repeat
     the angles for you, so you can copy them.
     The following MCC-7, maneuver the LM to the
     following FDAI attitudes: roll, 000; pitch, 91.3;
     yaw, 000. Now do you want those attitudes repeated, Fred?

[490180]
_page : 716
_tape : 
LMP: Okay. Following MCC-7 we're to maneuver to the
      following attitudes: roll, 000; pitch, 091.3;
      yaw, 000.

[490194]
_page : 716
_tape :

      a push of 0.5 feet per second, four-jet ullage;
      then execute SM SEP followedby a pull of 0.5 feet
      per second, with respect to a nomenclature on the

      a down of 0.5.

[490322]

[490350]
_page : 717
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. And I was about to say the LM Jettison pad
     is similar to the SM SEP pad, Fred, when you're
     ready to copy.

[490362]
_page : 717

[490741]
_page : 718
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. I just want to clarify one thing on the
      LM SEP pad. It appears to me that in my configura-
      tion, I could probably use a VERB 49 loading in
      622, yaw, pitch, and roll, in that order; and then
      being able to fly out at 5018 in roll, pitch, and
      yaw. Is that correct?

[490769]
_page : 718

      oh, about the 20th one down, after panel 276,
      where it says CB INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL 3

[490906]
_page : 719
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. The word we have is that you can't make
     a VERB 49 maneuver to the LM jettison attitude
     because those are FDAI angles we gave you, they
     don't correspond to the gimbal angles for the
     load; it'll have to be a manual maneuver. Over.

      on the contingency book pages 32, 33, and 34, be-
      cause the last time we went through this portion,

[493584]
_page : 721
_tape :

     in AGS, as you did the last midcourse manuever;
     we think it will save gas. Over.

[493596]
_page : 721

_page : 721
_tape : 
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[493753]
_page : 721
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. Our recommendation on this burn is that
     you maneuver to the bucn attitude, in PGNS MIN
     IMPULSE, then do a body-axis aline, 400 plus 5,
     followed by 400 plus 0, and then do the burn in
     AGS. Over.

[493774]
_page : 721
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Now we're spinning it with the PGNS, what
      you gave us for a PGNS attitude. Is this the wrong
      one? Do you want me to just to aline up the Earth
      as I did before in the last midcourse?

[493786]
_page : 721
_tape : 
CC:  No. We don't want you to do that. Read me your
     FDAI angles, and let's compare them with what
     we have down here.
     	Tape 91/9
     	Page 715

[493795]
_page : 722
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. You're looking at them in the DSKY. I've
      got roll of 8.47; pitch of about 0.51; and yaw
      looking at about 3.750.

[493818]
_page : 722
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. Those are very close - I guess all you
     need to do is trim them up a bit.

[493826]
_page : 722
_tape : 
CDR: I plan to do a final trim - AUTO trim, and then
      a four-jet translation.

[493840]
_page : 722
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. For fuel conservation, we'd prefer
     you to trim it up MIN IMPULSE, and there's really
     very little trim required; and then go ahead and
     do it AGS. We're on the expected fuel usage, but
     we're just being old ladies about it.

[493858]
_page : 722
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Understand. My only question, Joe, is the
      fact that both the roll and the yaw needles did
      not go to null when I did an AUTO maneuver. I'd
      tried to go manually to the attitude; and then
      went to AUTO, but the roll and the yaw do not
      come in at all.

[493874]
_page : 722
_tape : 
CC:  Roger. I haven't got an answer on that yet, but
     your attitude looks very close.

[493880]
_page : 722
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. I can take it on ...

[493965]
_page : 722
_tape : 
CDR: And, Houston, Aquarius. I'm not sure that if I
      follow and null the needles, that will be the
      proper attitude.

[493982]
_page : 722
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Stand by 1, Jim. We're talking about it.
     It's going to be very close; in any event, close
     enough.

[493990]
_page : 722
_tape : 
CDR: Okay.

[493996]
_page : 722
_tape : 
CC:  And, Jim, just for your information, I have the
     entry pad. I have the landing area weather
     summary, which you probably don't even have to
     copy, but which I'll read up to you when you're
     ready; and some stars for Jack that I'm holding
     for him for later on.

[494011]
_page : 722
_tape :

[494022]

      he just checked them again, and they're all over

[494102]
_page : 723
_tape :

      to null the PGNS needle manually?

[494108]

_page : 723
_tape : 
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[494211]
_page : 723
_tape : 
LMP: Yes. I guess the basic question is comparing the
      balls here and out the window it doesn't look
      too unreasonable, and I guess Jim says the COAS
      is yawed and roll slightly off from what he might
      eyeball; but yet, the FDAI air needles for PGNS
      are showing a full scale left in roll and full
      scale left in yaw. ...

[494237]
_page : 723
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Go ahead.

[494243]
_page : 723
_tape :

      aren't going to be on the attitude that we burned
      the last midcourse.

[494250]
_page : 723

[494437]
_page : 724
_tape : 
CC:  Oh, we're getting there, Jim. We're - we're all
     agreed that you're almost, but not quite, in the
     proper attitude, and we're just trying to get
     you one firm recommendation on how to proceed
     from here.

[494448]
_page : 724
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. I have nulled the null - roll needle and
      the pitch needle now and I'm yawed - rolled left
      now. I'm rolled left about 9 degrees.

[494459]
_page : 724
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Understand the needles are nulled.

[494463]
_page : 724
_tape :

[494467]
_page : 724

[494630]
_page : 724
_tape :

[494632]
_page : 724
_tape : 
CDR: Go ahead.

[494633]
_page : 724
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Here's the big story. Your attitude
     really looks quite good except in roll, and we'd
     like you to do the following. In MIN impulse
     PGNS, we'd like you to trim to zero pitch, which
     is about where you are now; to 008 degrees in
     roll, which is about 16 degrees from your pres-
     ent roll attitude; and to zero degrees in yaw,
     which is about where you are now. Then we'd
     like you to do the body-axis aline 400 plus 5,
     400 plus 0. PITCH and ROLL to PULSE, select
     AGS, do the burn in AGS. How does that sound?
     Over.

[494673]
_page : 724
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. I'm rolled the wrong way; that is what
      you're saying, right?

[494677]
_page : 724
_tape : 
CC:  That's right.

[494689]
_page : 724
_tape : 
CDR: And you know I can't roll in minimum impulse.
      I've got to use TTCAs.

[494696]
_page : 724
_tape : 
CC:  That's right, Jim. Sorry.

[494786]

      I take it.
      	Tape 92/2

[494802]

[494806]
_page : 725
_tape :

[494813]
_page : 725
_tape :

     the average g and burn it out.

[494820]
_page : 725
_tape :

[494871]
_page : 725

[494874]
_page : 725
_tape : 
CC:  Just for your information, we see 3.0 in regis-
     ter 1. We read you up 3.1 on the pad. The
     actual DELTA-V was 3.05, and they warned me that
     it might come out 3.0.

[494891]
_page : 725

[494893]
_page : 725
_tape : 
CC:  Right.

[494976]
_page : 725
_tape : 
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Your attitude looks real
     good. We will give you a mark at 10 minutes to
     the burn, which is in 28 seconds.

[494986]
_page : 725
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. We'll burn it in AGS and use the AGS ball.

[494994]
_page : 725
_tape : 
CC:  Right. I was looking at the wrong clock, and
     we're a little under 10 minutes now. I'll give
     you a mark at 9 minutes. Okay?

[495005]
_page : 725
_tape :

[495036]
_page : 725

      changed the script again.

[495488]
_page : 726

[495495]
_page : 726
_tape : 
LMP: Okay.

[495590]

[495657]

     pretty good. How's Jack getting along?

[496558]

[496640]
_page : 727
_tape :

      while we're firing. And I'll go back to the
      AGS mode.

[496651]
_page : 727
_tape :

     okay too. It's your choice.

[496657]
_page : 727

[496845]
_page : 728
_tape : 
CC: Roger. We recommend that you use the AGS for
     the separation maneuver, because we'd like to
     get the proper weight in for the DAP before we
     use the PGNS again.

     don't want any translation maneuvers.

[497176]
_page : 729

      up to the SM SEP attitude, I had to use TTCA to
      do it.

      just a streak.

[497299]

     on the outside or just nicked or what?

[497313]

      Joe, had - had stained it. I don't knew whether
      it did any actual deformation or not.

     him to do no further powerup of the CSM until
     EI minus 2 plus 30.

_page : 733
_tape :

     of a spacecraft than that, we might not give
     you another one. Hey, Jim; Houston. You might
     ask Jack, while he's down there, to take a peek
     through the telescope and tell us whether he
     can see any stars. Over.

[498274]
_page : 733

[498380]
_page : 733
_tape : 
CDR: Joe, Jack tells me that there's still a lot of
      particles floating around and he's - he can't
      pick out any constellation that he recognizes
      so far. But it might clear here in a little
      while.

_tape : 
CC:  Okay. EECOM is looking at that battery amperage
     that you gave us awhile ago. He'd like to see
     it about a half an amp to an amp lower. Like
     you to ask Jack to just check the circuit breakers
     and switches that he's pulled in so far and make
     sure he doesn't have any extra loads on MAIN A;
     specifically, the FLOODLIGHT configuration, and
     his CAUTION AND WARNING circuit breakers, and
     his ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER circuit
     breakers. Over.

[498885]
_page : 734
_tape :

     check the amperage on there; see what you have
     now, and give us a voltage reading, too.

[498935]
_page : 734
_tape : 
CC:  Go ahead.

[498937]
_page : 734
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. I've been not reading any voltage at all
      on BAT C, and the amperage looks like about
      2 amps, but that could be kind of noise-level
      stuff. I've got all the floodlights off and I -
      Can you think of anything - I could power dewar
      to lower MAIN A.

[498953]
_page : 734
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. How about reading the voltage off of
     MAIN A?

[498957]
_page : 734
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Oh, this is Ken. Okay. Ken, it was 30.2.

[498963]
_page : 734
_tape : 
CC: Okay. We're checking out the floodlights we
     gave you. Actually, Jack, you ought to be able
     to go ahead and use the lights we gave you.
     There's no reason to sit in the dark. They're
     supposed to be coming off of MAIN B, and we're
     checking that now.

[498979]
_page : 734
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. It's not bad down there. We're in - got
      plenty of light. But should I be reading the
      voltage on BAT C?

[498999]
_page : 734
_tape : 
CC:  Jack, you should be reading BAT C voltage. That
     circuit breaker should be open.

[499006]
_page : 734
_tape : 
CMP: Okay. Okay, can you think of anything else you
      want to get turned off to lighten load on MAIN A?

[499021]
_page : 734
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We're perusing that subject right now,
     Jack. It's really not that big a thing, just
     something we wanted to dress up.

     Jack turn off the RING 1's AUTO coils, which
     are probably on MAIN A. Rave him turn those
     off and take a look at the readings.

[499093]
_page : 735
_tape : 
CDR: Okay.

[499151]
_page : 735
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. Jack has turned off RING 1 that was on
      MAIN A, and he's still reading 30.2 volts.

[499159]
_page : 735
_tape : 
CC:  Roger that, Jim. What's his amperage? Did he
     read that off?

[499169]
_page : 735
_tape : 
CDR: I guess. Re says it's down in the mud; it's
      less than 2 amps.

[499172]
_page : 735
_tape : 
CC:  Down in the mud. Okay, understand that. Request
     he turn them back on and - Okay, Jim, that's the
     AUTO coils back on RING 1, MAIN A, and when you
     get that done, I'd like you to copy the entry
     pad.

[499225]
_page : 735
_tape :

[499229]
_page : 735
_tape :

     33, 353.1, 29.9. Boresight star is Sigma
     Libra, down 08.8, left 0.4; lift vector up.
     Comments: GDC for entry alinement, stars 31
     and 23. The roll aline 041, pitch 245, yaw 024,
     use EMS nonexit pattern. Maintain Moon-check
     attitude until moonset; then go to entry atti-
     tude or track horizon with the 36-degree window

[499508]
_page : 736
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Roger that, Jim. I want to verify a
     couple of things I'm not sure I heard you
     read back. The first one was Zebra Libra
     (laughter) that's Sigma Libra. The set
     stars 31 and 23. Did you get that? Over.

[499527]
_page : 736
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. No, I had 31 and 33, and I got Sigma
      Libra now, and it'll be 31 and 23 for the
      set stars.

[499534]
_page : 736
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. And your GDC pitch aline, I wasn't
     sure whether that was - whether you read
     back 245 or 045. The correct number is 245.
     Over.

[499545]
_page : 736
_tape : 
CDR: Good show, because I have 045 down. 245.

[499548]
_page : 736
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. And the Moon check here, unlike the
     horizon check, is on the 36-degree window
     mark all the way. Just wanted to repeat
     that.

[499568]
_page : 736

[499591]
_page : 736
_tape : 
CDR: Sounds good.

[499593]
_page : 736
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. In the mid-Pacific landing area, the
     weather is good. The cloud cover is 2000,
     scattered; visibility, 10; winds 060 at 10;
     wave heights are 4 feet, and the altimeter
     2986, if you care. Scattered showers less
     than 10 percent of the area. Recovery forces
     are as follows: the Iwo Jima will be at the
     touchdown point, the aircraft call sign will
     be Recovery 1, on station with swimmers on
     board. The - we have the constant g backup
     reentry area covered with the USS Hall, the
     Good Liberty Ship, and the other recovery
     aircraft whose call signs you may hear are
     Samoa Rescue C-130s.

      recovery ship.

[499654]
_page : 737
_tape :

[499657]
_page : 737
_tape : 
CDR: Joe, Jack tells me he is still having trouble
      looking through the optics. I'm just going to

      get into the dark spot.

[499666]
_page : 737
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, real fine. You might tell him when we get
     to that point, we have some - some stars with
     corresponding shaft and trunnion angles to pass
     to him as backups in case the computer doesn't
     happen to point him straight at one. And it's
     the Summer Triangle.

[499955]
_page : 738
_tape :

     the command module to ease the load on MAIN A.
     One of them is to verify or turn the CM/RCS
     HEATER switch to OFF. We're done with that, and
     even though the circuit breakers are pulled, the
     switches might be drawing a little current. And
     the second one is, we'd like him to turn SCS
     LOGIC POWER 2/3 to OFF; we don't need it now.
     It's called up in the checklist at the appropri-
     ate time, and we'd like him to turn that off.
     Over.

[500000]
_page : 738
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. I'll tell Jack to check that the CM/RCS
      HEATER switch is off, and, if not, we'll turn
      it off; and also to turn off the SCS LOGIC POWER
      2/3 switch, OFF, since it comes up later in the
      checklist.

[500014]
_page : 738
_tape :

[500054]
_page : 738

[500354]
_page : 738
_tape :

      about 115 instead of about 91. I think Jack can
      use the optics a little bit better at that angle.

[500368]
_page : 738

      look at them a little bit better here.

[500381]
_page : 739
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. With the new attitude, our shaft and trun-
     nion angles we were going to pass him don't mean
     anything, but it's more important to have a good
     star field.

[500985]
_page : 739
_tape :

[500988]
_page : 739
_tape : 
CDR: Go ahead.

[500989]
_page : 739
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. We - We've been talking about your
     going to a different attitude than the pad atti-
     tude for better star field vision out the command
     module, and what we'd like to have you do is this.
     If you can predict now or sometime soon, what
     attitude it is that you would like to hold at
     that time, and go to that attitude now, we'd like
     to be able to compute the coarse aline gimbal
     angles for the CSM, and we can do that if you go
     to the selected attitude, hold it, call up a
     VERB 06 NOUN 20, and read us your LM gimbal angles,
     we can take those and compute CSM coarse aline
     gimbal angles on the assumption that, when we get
     back into the CSM coarse aline, you will return
     to that selected attitude. Does that sound okay?
     Over.

[501046]
_page : 739
_tape : 
CDR: Yes. I'll try to hold the attitude we select
      directly, while you're giving us the coarse aline
      attitude. We're not too sure what - what's the
      best attitude. I'm going to ask Jack again if
      115 is sufficient for him.

[501062]
_page : 739
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. You can take some time figuring out the
     best attitude, and then you won't have to hold
     it all the way from now until then, if you just
     get back to it.

[501178]
_page : 739
_tape : 
CDR: Houston, Jack would like to know what constella-
      tions are in his sextant, or scanning telescope,
      field of view at an attitude of about 105 pitch,
      zero roll, zero yaw. Can you give that to us?

[501195]
_page : 739
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We'll sure give it a go. As I said, we -
     We have some stars. They're not - They're not
     centered with the shaft and trunnion zero. Let
     us take a quick look at 105 pitch, shaft and
     trunnion zero, and see if we can get you an
     answer.

     exactly centered, but, at a pitch attitude of
     115, we had computed that Vega, Altair, Rasalhague,
     and Deneb would all be in the telescope field of
     view, and the first three were also in view at
     the 91-degree pitch, so he should be able to see
     one or more of those four stars. Over.

     if - if he's interested.

[501282]
_page : 740
_tape :

      nion for - say, Altair at 115, and I'll go up
      there, and I'll see if he can pick it up.

[501292]

[501685]
_page : 741
_tape :

[501690]
_page : 741
_tape : 
CDR: I ran back there to take a look and see what I
      could see in the - in the scanning telescope.
      It looks pretty grim back there right now. It
      might be that we have to go with the coarse aline,
      and maybe computation of some fine aline docking
      angles, if we have time.

[501706]
_page : 741
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. We'd like to do that, too. Wait a minute;
     stand by, Jim.

[501808]
_page : 741
_tape : 
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

[501811]
_page : 741
_tape : 
CDR: I read you loud and clear.

[501812]
_page : 741
_tape : 
CC: Okay. What we'd like to do, Jim, is - We'll go
     ahead and get the coarse aline to the gimbal
     angles that - that you're going to be holding
     for us; and we'll get the platform up, and then
     when you call P52 and you use PICAPAR, it prob-
     ably won't be close enough to put the star in
     the sextant, but if you can see any kind of a
     bright star in the general vicinity, - and like
     general vicinity, I mean 2 to 3 degrees from the
     center of the telescope, so that you have some
     clue as to which way to go, then the identifica-
     tion problem shouldn't present much of a - of a
     	Tape 93/5
     	Page 735
     
     difficulty. And once you get the thing in the
     sextant, then you can go ahead and treat it like
     any other PICAPAR.

[501858]
_page : 742
_tape : 
CDR: That sounds great, Ken. One little problem:
      there's all sorts of bright objects floating
      around us, and also that just staring at part
      of Aquarius; it's just reflecting light like
      mad. We can give it a try. There's no problem
      there; if we can see it, we'll get it.

[501878]
_page : 742
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. And in - in the event that that doesn't
     work, we're standing by with the original scheme,
     a set of LM FDAI angles to fly to that'll point
     the command module optics at the Moon and the
     Sun; so we can always go back to that.

[501893]
_page : 742
_tape :

[502269]
_page : 742
_tape :

      you have the stars figured out, and the coarse
      aline angle for it.

[502278]
_page : 742
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. Roger that, Jim. Then at - at your con-
     venience here, we'd like you to go to that atti-
     tude, as close as you can get, and call up a
     NOUN 20 for us.

[502291]

[502502]
_page : 742
_tape : 
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[502505]
_page : 742
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. I take it that, if - if Jack cannot see
      stars at this attitude after you give him the
      coarse aline angles, we're just not going to
      	Tape 93/6
      	Page 736
      
      read down to you our gimbal angles and have you
      figure out a target angle for Jack, but you want
      him to do sighting on the Moon and the Sun. Is
      that correct?

[502526]
_page : 743
_tape : 
CC:  That's roughly correct, Jim. Jack will coarse
     aline at that attitude. This is what we're hav-
     ing you maneuver to the - to that attitude for.
     We're going to compute coarse aline gimbal angles
     and pass them up to him, and the first thing he'll
     do when he gets there, per his checklist, is to
     coarse aline his platform. Then he'll go into
     the P52, and, if he can't see stars, we will
     quickly pass up to you the - your FDAI angles to
     put him in the Moon-view attitude, and he'll do
     his P52 on the Moon, and then have you maneuver
     on the Sun and complete the P52 of the Sun.

[502571]
_page : 743
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. But I'm going to have to maneuver to the
      Moon to help him out.

[502575]
_page : 743
_tape : 
CC:  Oh. That's - That's affirmative. If he can't
     see stars at the - at the SEP attitude that -
     that you'll be holding, you'll have to maneuver
     to the Moon attitude and then to the Sun attitude
     for him.

_tape :

[502649]
_page : 743
_tape :

[502650]
_page : 743
_tape : 
CC:  Just like to mention that, even if, for some
     reason, we run out of time or something and
     don't complete the Moon-Sun P52, Jack will have
     a platform coarse aline to the entry REFSMMAT,
     which we feel will be plenty good enough.

[502666]
_page : 743
_tape :

[503450]
_page : 743
_tape : 
CC:  Hi! Jim, we - We've gone ahead and computed
     the CSM coarse aline gimbal angles based on your
     being at the service module SEP attitude at the
     time that Jack cranks up the computer and - and
     coarse alines the IMU. That is, we assume that
     	Tape 93/7
     	Page 737
     you're going to be at roll, 0; pitch, 091; yaw, 0;
     and, if you concur on that, I'd like to pass up
     the angles for - for Jack to have.

[503487]
_page : 744

[503531]
_page : 744
_tape :

      298.95; PITCH, 271.30; and YAW, 000.20.

[503541]
_page : 744

[504055]
_page : 744
_tape : 
CC:  Okay, Jim. We're getting about 9 minutes from
     the commencement of command module powerup, and
     we wanted to just mention to you for Jack's
     benefit that, although the batteries are looking
     real good, in case they're cool and have a little
     difficulty hacking the load just at first, we'd
     like him to monitor main bus voltage to 24 volts
     or above during the powerup procedure and, if it
     falls below, we'll have a couple of circuit
     breakers for him that - that will solve the prob-
     lem.

[504093]
_page : 744
_tape : 
CDR: Okay. And I take it you're also monitoring
      main bus voltage.

[504098]
_page : 744

     time, because we don't call up telemetry until
     a little bit later on.

     That should take 9 or 10 minutes, and it's our firm
     feeling that you don't have to wait another
     10 minutes after that for a leak check. If it
