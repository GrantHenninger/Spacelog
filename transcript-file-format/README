This is documentation for/a sample of the Transcript File format.

The best file to look at, initially, is a13/TEC, which describes the format of
the Transcript Files.

Other files of note:

- a13/MEDIA: a sample ‘media stream’ Transcript File, detailing a wholly
  non-textual stream
- a13/_meta: A file describing non-stream specific (but limited to a13)
  metadata, such as acts, key scenes, and glossary.
