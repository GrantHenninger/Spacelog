# This is a comment
# Blank, or whitespace-only, lines, like the next one, are always ignored

# Throughout this file, we will refer to:
# - “next non-comment line” as NNC

# NNC is a timestamp, in seconds from mission start.
# NOTE: These can also be negative.
[-10]
# NNC is a page reference. You only need to have this at the
# start of each page; it automatically applies to the following
# lines until a new page reference is provided.
_page: 1

# NNC is a logline.
# Loglines are of the form /^[speaker]\s+:\s+[text]$/
CAPCOM: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, …

# NNC is a metaline, and continues across all following
# lines starting with /\s+/
# Metalines (when combined with continuations) are
# of the form /_[meta_key]\s+:\s+[JSON data]/
# NOTE: Both loglines and metalines can continue using this format.
# The JSON data must always be indented - don't unindent the last {.
_labels: {
    "funny"  : 12, # This label applies from here until timestamp 12 (inclusive)
    "stupid" : null # This label applies only to this log line.
    }
# NNC contains a link to the speaker Jim (who is ID'd as CDR).
# This fragment is of the form [type:key the link text].
CMP: Okay. P11, [speaker:CDR Jim].
