# Blank, or whitespace-only, lines, like the next one, are always ignored

# Throughout this file, we will refer to:
# - ‘next non-comment line’ as NNC

# NNC is a timestamp, in seconds from mission start.
# NOTE: These can also be negative.

# NNC is a page reference. You only need to have this at the
# start of each page; it automatically applies to the following
# lines until a new page reference is provided.

# NNC is a logline.
# Loglines are of the form /^[speaker]\s+:\s+[text]$/

# NNC is a metaline, and continues across all following

# Metalines (when combined with continuations) are

# NOTE: Both loglines and metalines can continue using this format
