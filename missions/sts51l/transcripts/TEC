(NASA: Caution and warning alarm.  Routine occurrence during prelaunch).

[-00:00:00:50]
CDR: OK.

[-00:00:00:47]
CDR: OK there.

[-00:00:00:43]
PLT: Alarm looks good.
(NASA: Cabin pressure is acceptable.)

[-00:00:00:42].
CDR: OK.

[-00:00:00:40]
PLT: Ullage pressures are up.
(NASA: External tank ullage pressure.)

[-00:00:00:34]
PLT: Right engine helium tank is just a little bit low.
(NASA: SSME supply helium pressure.)

[-00:00:00:32]
CDR: It was yesterday, too.

[-00:00:00:31]
PLT: OK.

[-00:00:00:30]
CDR: Thirty seconds down there.
(NASA: 30 seconds till launch.)

[-00:00:00:25]
PLT: Remember the red button when you make a roll call.
(NASA: Precautionary reminder for communications configuration.)

[-00:00:00:23]
CDR: I won't do that; thanks a lot.

[-00:00:00:15]
CDR: Fifteen.
(NASA: 15 seconds till launch.)

[-00:00:00:06]
CDR: There they go guys.
(NASA: SSME Ignition.)

MS 2: All right.

CDR: Three at a hundred.
(NASA: SSME thrust level at 100% for all 3 engines.)

[00:00:00:00]
MS 2: Aaall riiight.

[00:00:00:01]
PLT: Here we go.
(NASA: Vehicle motion.)

[00:00:00:07]
CDR: Houston, Challenger roll program.
(NASA: Initiation of vehicle roll program.)

[00:00:00:11]
PLT: Go you Mother.

[00:00:00:14]
MS: LVLH.
(NASA: Reminder for cockpit switch configuration change. Local vertical/local horizontal).

[00:00:00:15]
MS 2: (Expletive) hot.

[00:00:00:16]
CDR: Ooohh-kaaay.

[00:00:00:19]
PLT: Looks like we've got a lotta wind here today.

[00:00:00:20]
CDR: Yeah.

[00:00:00:22]
CDR: It's a little hard to see out my window here.

[00:00:00:28]
PLT: There's ten thousand feet and Mach point five.
(NASA: Altitude and velocity report.)

[00:00:00:30]
Garble.

[00:00:00:35]
CDR: Point nine.
(NASA: Velocity report, 0.9 Mach).

[00:00:00:40]
PLT: There's Mach one.
(NASA: Velocity report, 1.0 Mach).

[00:00:00:41]
CDR: Going through nineteen thousand.
(NASA: Altitude report, 19,000 ft.)

[00:00:00:43]
CDR: OK we're throttling down.
(NASA: Normal SSME thrust reduction during maximum dynamic pressure region.

[00:00:00:57]
CDR: Throttling up.
(NASA: Throttle up to 104% after maximum dynamic pressure.

[00:00:00:58]
PLT: Throttle up.

[00:00:00:59]
CDR: Roger.

[00:00:00:60]
PLT: Feel that mother go.

[00:00:00:60]
Woooohoooo.

[00:00:01:02]
PLT: Thirty-five thousand going through one point five

[00:00:01:05]
CDR: Reading four eighty six on mine.
(NASA: Routine airspeed indicator check.)

[00:00:01:07]
PLT: Yep, that's what I've got, too.

[00:00:01:10]
CDR: Roger, go at throttle up.
(NASA: SSME at 104 percent.

[00:00:01:13]
PLT: Uhoh.
