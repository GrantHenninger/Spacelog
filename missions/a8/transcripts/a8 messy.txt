 OIL x! 14 26 CMP Roger. With such good visibility or such good
 comunications, ve'll just give you a ver5a.l
 description vithout seeing the scanning tele-
 scope right now. Your angles for maneuver
 tuning Arctu.~~~ vere quite good. I've got
 Ar&urus centered in the scanning telescope.
 At this sun angle, there is a shaft of light
 directly across the center of the scanning tele-
 scope and - band of light. It precludes see-
 ing alotof stars aroundus, and althou I
 kept IQ eye glued to the telescope now for
 some time, it's very difficult to see any star
 patterns or anything. I couldn't recognize
 that with Arcturus unless I - the objects just
 drove me there. Hov because I'm near zero .
 shaft and zero trumion, I'm getting quite a
 bit of shaft movement. Everytime the shaft
 moves, more particles leave the optics, and
 they're just as bright as the surrounding stars.

 c) Aod they mingle in the stars, and you can't
. tell star patterns or constellations. With
 this particular attitude, the shaft of light
 precludes any indentification of constellations
 or individual stars.
 01 I.2 15 47 CC ow. Copy that. Can you tell us something
 about the orientation of this band? You men-
 tioned #at last night also - that you also had
 a band about 10 degrees vide that ran across.
 Is there an orientation that ve can tie that to?
 01 1.2 16 05 a@ I believe so, Ken. This band is parallel to
 the M-line, and I think it has something to do
 vith the design of the optics.‘ vhere ve have
 that shaft or the rectangular entrance of the
 optics from the outside. At this particular
 sun angle, it cuts right across. Bov I noticed
 that both the earth and the sun do this to the
 8canning telescope. In the sextant, the same
 light band is there, slthcugh it covers the
 entire sextant's field of view. However, the
 asgnification brings out the stars quite well,
 and it is possible to mark on it. But the
 identification of the stars vith the scanning
 telescope makes it very difficult. Hov the
 attitude that I found the optics are best at
 are the attitudes vhich give the constellations

 02 03 17 52 cc We would like to talk to Jim about it uhen he is
 ready to copy.
 02 03 17 59 Re’r ready.
 02 03 18 01 cc OW-
 02 03 18 03 Oood morning, Mike. How are you doingP
 42 03 18 OS ?ine, fine, Jim. llou are sounding good thin'
 morning. We would like to give you a little
 rundown on these atare. Aa you can see in the
 flitit plan, we've got you scheduled for a num-
 ber 33, A&area, number 34, Atria, and number 40,
 old Altair. Ilow, the first of those, Anteres,
 is in plane; the second two are out of plane. As
 you knov, we would like to'get a mixture of the in
 and the out of plene. Antares, number 33, is
 cl080 to the sun, and ve expect that you are going
 to have difficulty getting thsse measurements on
 number 33. We vould like very nuch for you to
 try, but if you are unable to do number 33. then
 w propose that you uBe nuuber. 42, which is Peacock,
 .’ to the lunar far horizon. We realize Peacock ian't
 L the greatest one available - greateet etar in the
 84 - but it'8 about the only one available. Over.

 it last time, but I & one met before I lost
 the moon canpletely in the vbite haze. I'll
 give it another try, end if it doesn't work
 mt, we vill go to Peacock and give it -
 02 0319 26 cc That - that is affimative, Jim, end if neither
 Antuee nor Peacock work, well then, ve just will
 be happy to go with Atria and with Altair. We
 would like them to increase the number of aete
 and do three on Atria, that le. number 34, and tvo
 on Altair, number 40; but that ie on4 in the event
 that you can get neither Antares nor Peacock.

 Glistening to the voice quality - it sounds real

 you c8n anticipate the burn in the neighborhood
 of 3 foot per second. We're considering and

 of doing this burn using the onboard vector and
 Just have us update the vector in the L&l slot, so
 that you will have the lGFR vector on board. But

 a? 10 06 45 cc Okay, Bill. I guess I want to belay my last
 about using the onboard state vector for MCC 4.
 After looking at it some more on the ground,
 they've got to get going on making the PAD's
 and doing all their canputations, and rather
 than put it oif or do it twice, we're going to
 go ahead and go with the procedures we've been
 using all along. On the lunar orbit stuff,
 we've been looking it over and we got several
 . @YS - Jack Schmitt end company in the back
 rocm- looking at what effect your windows have.
 And, basically, it looks like there's two op-
 tions that will make an impact on that BEV 2.
 One of the options, of course, will be just to
 have you and Jim change seats and let Jim look
 out and get his SAM that way, and another option
 vi11 be to roll the bird over and let Jim point
 the optics as far forward as he can get them and
 take his SAM through the telescope. And I guess
 we'd like to have any thoughts that you folks
 have on what you think you can do with the win-
( .‘& dowe; if you have anything, we'd like to factor

 our plans as early as we can. We'd like not to
 put it oii 80 that we have none of these things
 to do after midcourse. YOU kooks can probably
 tell us more about what you can do with those
 windows. go if you have any thoughts, go ahead
 and sing out with them, and we'll see what we
 (
 can do about factoring that in.
 I
 02 10 08 25 IalP Olray- With reference to the midcourse, I think
 that's generally agreed upon, that we do it like
 we've always been doing it. Now, with respect
 to the tidows, center windows, 'essentially, are
 usable. The two side windows are - mq be all
 7
 right for observation, aad the problem with the
0. rendezvous windows is that they're pretty small.
 And I just-thought we'd have to play the window
 - game by ear almost. got really sure what capa-
 'bility we're going to have. And we.11 give you _
 some more thoughts on this later.
 -02 10 oq 02 cc okay. How about exercising the idea of rolling
 over and having Jim do his polarization through
 the telescope because if we have to change at-

 expect to be doing a water boil of about
 1 pound per hour, aud this is just an approxi-

 as to vhat the vater boiling requirements may
 be. tight go anywhere from boiling lots to
 not boiliug at all. The next water dump will
 be coming up after TEI, so you don't have to
 worry about auy of that until you get through.
 Communications predicti- are looking good,
 . possibly a little bit better than what we had
 hoped for, and looks like we're going to get
 high bit rate on OMnI's vith our 21%fOOt

 sure and we'll remind you again to stir up the
 oxygen prior to LCI.' CMCis running along like

 are looking good. You're using the same amount
 as predicted for your P!l!C and for your align-

 we're going to tell you that you can use
 30 percent per quad in lunar orbit. Now this
 is quite a bit of Fuel to play with, and you
 CSrl take 30 percent and substract that froza

 DSE is extremely poor. We consider it unusable,

 not count on using the tap-e at low bit rate for
 voice.

 are having a hard time trying to do a neat job
 of logging. I'll txy to do it-on the flight

 we'll put them on the DSE, and I'll try to
 scribble some notes here and there.

 like to, if we could, time the TV to a passing over

 impressive thing we've seen, and that might be

 the best thing rather than trying to acquire

 give you a quick rundown of the status of photo
 targets. You ready to copy?
 03 02 41 59 cc Ready to copy.
 03 02 42 05 IMP okay. At REY 1, we got photo target 90 and
 terminator photography south for near-side ter-
 minator. Starting on REX 2, we've got target
 l2and targets 10, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, and 23.
 Unfortunately, we got into a high - I got into
 the high-speed film there somewhere, and I think
 those 25&m targets were on high speed. We did
 change film, and starting out in Tex - Crater,
 Texas, titB tar-get 28, 31, 40, 36, plus several
 targets of opportunity that were recorded on the
 DSE, but apparently lost. Have you been able to
 .03 02 43 13 cc Yes, I'm with you, Bill. Keep going. .
 03 02 43 18 Im okay. I might be calling up too fast. Okay.
 On the third REV, we got target 58 and 63 and 65.
 The training photography was accomplished, and it
 was done on magazine D, which now has - correction,
 that's magazine E - which now shows 95 exposures.
 Magazine D is fresh. Magazine K was also used for
 training photography, and it's showing 0.51.

 while we're doing that, for Bill the DSE voice
 quality on high bit rate is very good, so if
 he wants to use the DSE in high bit rate for a

 things, we suggest that he do that. We would
 like him to wait 20 seconds after turning it

 system. I used AUTO OPTICS for control points 1 and
 2 on the backside, and they worked beautifully,
 tracked both the targets for me. And I went to the
 control point 3 as designated in our orbital control
 book to see the latitude and longitude that was given
 to me and used AUTO OPTICS to track that particular
 coordinate system, and it was very close to the ac-
 tual tracking plot. I pickecl the mark there whext
 I did a final marking and recorded latitude and lon-
 gitude. I'm now about to come up on 'the landing site
 and using AUTO OPTICS in the coded input to see how
 that works.

 be doing all right, but the eyeball is having a
 little trouble looking through all this smear on

 03 08 10 25 CC Roger. Understand the optics are doing better than
 the eyeballs. How about the cameras?
 03 08 10 33 LMP We always have the same smear to look through. The

 unlike the sunrise on earth where the atmosphere
 affects it. This just sort of is a complete haze

 did he notice any twinkling while this w3s taking

 the comments above the terrain. Ihere appeared
 what might be called diagonal light or light due
 to the haze or something like that. As the sun
 came above or before the sun came above the limb,
 definite rays could be seen coming from the other
 side. It was 3 uniform haze emanating from the
 center spot where the sunwas going to rise, and
 this was something which I didn't expect.

 In pounds, it looks like you have, for example,

 and 190 in Delta. And the difference that you
 read on the gage is attributed to the fact that
 you don't have all of the correction factors in

 03 la 14 03 cc Roger. Notice that you are starting on your P23
 which is the last scheduled activity. Initial
 tracking looks like the initial midcourse may be
 less than the 4 foot per second on the first guess.
 And we have looked at your burn data, and it's
 all just as smooth as you said; everything on
 there looked real nominal. Systems now iook good;
 looks like in PTC attitude, we should be able to
 switch OMNI's for you, if you would like to do that.
 We were having good success with predicting on the
 way out where to switch the antennas, and if it
 will help you %-.y, we can do that on the way back
 in.
 03 18 14 48 CDR That would be nice if you could do it, but we will
 keep one man in the shop to watch the gimbal angles;
 but if you could switch the OMXI's, it would sure
 save us a lot of problems.
 03 18 14 58 Okay. We will do that. When you get in the FTC
 attitude, we will let you know when we take the
 command on the antenna switching.
 Okay. Just be careful what you do with the tape
 recorder. Bill's a little sensitive ahout that.
 03 18 15 25 Roger. We were listening to ihe tape dumps, and
 it looks like Bill gets a happy new year after all.

 James Lovell, along with Air Force Major William
 A. Anders and Col. Borman were safely on their
 way home. Any other Christmas Eve, the families
 of the astronauts would have been in church for
 Christmas services, but this.year they were all
 glued to their television sets. The homes all
 near the Manned Spacecraft Center were decorated.
 The lawns around the Love11 home ant throughout
 his community of Timber Cove were lined with
 Mexicti style luminaries, and the four Love11
 children came out to light them about 7~30. They
 were just in time. At 8:OQ, a car t'rve up

 Jeffrey recoiled at the sight. His mother held
 him up, and Jeffrey clung to her, s-.ill shying
 away. "Last year he ran away crying-," saying
 his 15-year old sister Barbara. Earlier, she
 had to run after him to prevent his blowing
 out all the luminaries. The other ‘.ovell children,
 13-year-old James and lo-year-old Stsan watched
 with great amusement. Finally, the Santa and
 the children disappeared inside; thts presents

 cc Roger. The problems you have run into so far are
 due to some unknown source, p robabl) EMI or the like
 loading your CMC trunnion cell which is now 91, so
 it doesn't really represent your trle trunnion angle.
 Bow this loading problem we don't feel implies any
 decrease in the reliability in your CMC at sll. We
 think that the best way to circumvent the problem
 is to cycle the OPTICS ZERO switch first to OFF and
 then ON prior to using the optics fcr any purpose.
 And with that procedure, I think you probably won't
 have any more problems. Over.

 by sighting on stars and on horizons of either
 the moon or the earth. And this is where we
 find out exactly uhere we are in space, what
 direction, and how fast we are traveling. And
 our computer, as Frank has mentioneli, takes
 information and tells us how to maneuver to
 get home safely. I work with the scanning
 telescope and the sextant, and occa.;ionally, if
 I get too busy, I- just sort of flea: out of sight

 with POl; there-
 fore, the W-matrix that you have right now is
 not a good one, and we would not wart you to
 continue your P23 sightings with that matrix.
 So the procedure I'm going to give you is
 going to cause the matrix to reinitialize itself
 prior to your next P23, when you go into P23.
 And this will put you back with the value of the
 W-matrix which you loaded after TRI, you remember,
 that 3303 thing. And if this has any further
 effects on the flight plan, we're in the process
 of sorting that out, and if need be, we'll send
 you up a revised sighting schedule later, both
 with the COX4 and loss of CO!,sf case. OLer .

 04 14 36 56 cc Roger. It looked like we did break lock there
 for about 8 minutes.

 was still having about AGC right at the noise

 04 14 37 17 cc Roger.
 04 14 37 30 LKP When we get out here in the clear zone, when

 the high gain definitely going past the scan

 'go ahead aa ask - you could ask if the RF.ACQ

 04 14 42 01 cc Hey, Bill, can you tell us what angies this went
 through? The curve that we have plotted is
 apparently the RF limit rather than the mechan-
 . ical limit; and discussing the function of the
 AUTO RRACQ mode, it looks like it is supposed
 to shift when it hits the RP limit, which is
 your- should be your ENTER set of numbers
 as opposed to the scan warning limit. And if
 it went inside of that number, could you tell
 us about what kind of numbers it did go to?

 plus 60 to 80 pitch. Copy?
 04 14 43 15 cc Roger.
 04 14 43 19 IMP Okay. The AGC dropped off to what I call our
 noise level, that was the voltage level on the
 AGC measured at - integrated when the noise
 broke in. It was about 11 o'clock position on
 the gage, and it looked like it was switching
 beam widths there off and on. It would pulse
 up and down, and a couple of times dropped to
 full-scale low very briefly.
 Oh 14 43 52 CC Okay. You got some marks on that AGC that
 should register in volts, I believe. Do you
 have an indication other than 11 o'clock?
 04 14 44 06 IMP Unfortunetely, the numbers never got on here.
 If you vi11 look on that chart that Fred Haise
 has, it shows one at 11 o'clock position which
 is the noise level. I don't remember what the
 voltage was. I might have it on my systems
 book, though.
 04 14 44 24 cc Bill,--
 04 14 44 25 Im When the antenna - when the antenna did snap

 I
04 14 51 32 cc I am sorry, Bill. You didn't come through.
 Say again, please.
04 14 51 38 LMP Since we are not - it is not clear to me that
 we weren't UQ against mechanical stops for a
 while on the last time around. That might
 account for 10 minutes of that 15 minutes, and
 there is no sense pushing our luck. I think
 we ought to - if it starts dropping off again,
 we just ought to go and put it back into MANUAL
 and take it back where it belongs. We are still
 a long way from home, and if that antenna switch
 fails, it's going to fail the high-gain position,
 ana that's all we got.
Oh 14 52 18 cc Roger, Bill. And we will be making a handoff
 on stations at 5:5.

 04 18 49 37 CDR Roger.
 04 18 4g 43 cc Okay. Ue've reviewed most of the book up here,
 and we will have to-come back and suggest a way
 that we can check out the wate: boiler prior to
 getting reentry area. We've revier..d all of the
 last minutes changes that were put in - pen and
 ink type things - and they're all looking good.
 On page E-7, like to add a couple of items.
 04 18 50 15 CDR what's that?
 04 18 50 16 cc Okay. On step 34 under final stowage, which is
 a sort of c&-h-all area, there's a steE that
 says secondary glycol to radiator that bypass
 verify. While we are do-wn in this area, we
 would like to go to panel 382, the water control
 panel, and set up the evaporator water control
 valve both primary and secondary to AUTO. Now
 this is something we would have done had we done
 the cold soak at minus 12 hours, but since we

 veren't doing it there, we would like to go
 ahead and make sure we have these in AUTO, and
 this will enable automatic controls from the
 panel.
 04 18 51 02 CDR Can we just make this part of the procedure
 when we test out the water boilers beforehand?
 04 18 51 08 cc Yes, sir. If we get that checked out earlier,
 -re can just ieave them in AUTO.
 04 18 51 13 CDR I'd rather do that.

 04 18 52 39 cc Roger. We got a discussion going; be right

 04 18 53 50 cc Okay, Apollo 8. On page E-9 - -
 04 18 53 57 CDR okay.
 04 18 53 58 cc - - at the top of the page, you have step 38,
 and right underneath that, prior to step 39, we
 .
 want to have a primary glycol loop uctivation.
- What ve are doing is to get the glycol evapora-
C.-j tor water switch to AUTO and the glycol evap-
 orator steam pressure switched to AUTO. This
 vill get your prinary water boiler on the line
 prior to entry, or at least it'll enable it.
 04 18 54 35 CDR Okay. Tell IIE what to write in, Ken.
 04 18 54 37 cc Okay. It's glycol 'evaporator water to AUTO.

 04 18 56 40 CDR I'm not reading you now, Houston.
 04 18 56 44 cc Roger. How now?
 04 18 56 48 CDR Loud and clear.
 04 18 56 49 cc Okay. There's some question from reading the
 checklist. It is my understanding that both
 the primary and the secondary water boilers
 vill be OR for the actual entry, and don't find
 a place in the checklist where it's actually
- turned on. So we'd like to get confirmation
c.,
 on that, and we'll make sure that we have all
 the proper switching to put in the checklist.
 04 18 57 16 CDR Okay.
 04 18 57 23 cc A.iri,$lt . Still on page E-9 and under step 39
 at the bottom of the pyro circuit check, there's
 a step that says panel 8, all circuit breakers
 CLOSED except and then it lists five that are
 printed, one that was pen-and-inked before
 launch. It says EDS power circuit breakers 3
 OPEN, and to be complete, we ought to add the
 RCS heater circuit breakers. There's two of
 those, and they should also be OPEN.

 04 18 58 48 CDR Roger. I'm with you.
 04 18 58 50 cc Okay. On step 5 on E-11, there's - the first
 . subtitle there is Relmets and Gloves, and the
 items that follow beneath that are affected by
 whether you wear suits or come in shirt sleeves,
 but they do have to be accomplished. And the
 suit return air valves would actually be OPEN
 for a shirt-sleeve entry. And you should have
 a line penciled in of optics power to OFF between
 an emergency cabin pressure valve and the time
 . when the CMP moves to.the couch.
0-. \ 04 18 59 26 CDR Right.
 - 04.18 5928 cc Okay. And the step shows the tape recorder to
 REWIND at minus 30. Now that's an onboard step
 rather than a ground step, just to verify that.
 04 18 59 48 CDR Okay. iI
 ’ 04 18 59 50 cc Okay. Under step 6, almost at the bottom - in
 'I
 fact, it's three lines from the bottom of
 step 6 - there's a section that says secondary
 coolant loop evaporator to RESET, and should
 be a note that that's 58 seconds if you hold
 it in RESET prior to moving the pump OFF.

 ,I. 04 19 42 52 cc Uell, what we were thinking about doing was boiling
0 a little out of the secondary evaporator to check
 it out, just as a component check, something we
 need to do; but if there's somebody down there in
 the vay, why, we can do that some other time.
 : 04 19 43 17 LMP Well, if it boils, we are going to know it before -
 it won't take long to find out it won't boil.
 There's not a heck of a lot we can do about it, so
 v?ly don't we wait until someone else wakes up here,
 Frank wakes up again. How will that be?
 04 19 43 27 cc Yes. That would be fine. There is something you
 can do; you can reservice it. And it is kind of
 a tediousprocess, and that's t5e reason vhy we just

 some idea prior to entry if we can count on having
 two loops or one. Which kind of leads us into
 ‘L- --

 Tape 76
 Page 18
 another question we are trying to pin down, two
 questions, in fact. Number one, we would like
 to verify that you do plan to use both primary
 and secondary boilers during the actual entry,
 end we are also looking for a way of checking the
 primary boiler to make sure it isn't dried out prior
 ,
 to entry. And that is turning into a little more
 of a challenge than you might suspect. If you
 have any thoughts on that subject, we can go over
 that.
04 19 44 21 r&P The answer to the question is yes, we do plan to
 use both. Before we get into the water boiler
 pump though, CDR would like to take a Seconal also;
 make sure he can get off to sleep here.
04 19 44 !I1 cc Okay. That's a GO.
04 lg 44 46 LMP Okay. On the water boiler: it's interesting Linat
 .I get my own - I was going to say anytime you have
 your mike keyed, I can hear myself talk with about
 a 2-second time delay. With respect to the primary
 and secondary boiler checks, I thirJc that is a good
 idea to make sure we got them both prior to entry
 and have the reservicing procedures handy.
04 19 45 39 cc Roger, Bill. You know the secondary - well, in fact,
 both reservicing procedures are available in a
 malfunction book, and sort of the problem with check-
 ing out the primary boiler is finding a way to
 make it boil on the way in,

 04 19 46 03 w Yes. Just a second, I got another little chore
 going here.
 04 lg 46 39 LMP Roger. It looks like the only way we'll be able
 .
 to do it would be to shut off the radiators.
 04 lg 46 48 cc We were looking for a little more docile way to
 do that.
 04 19 46 55. L&P Roger; That way would be agreeable to me too,
 a little more docile way, but they shouldn't
 freeze up if we did it quickly.
 04 19 47 08 cc Roger. We are talking over several things, you
 know, like putting the ten-pin valve to KANUAL
 or partially closing it or some of these different
 ideas, and something you can think about whiie
 you are laying there with nothing else to do.
 04 19 47 26 LMe Yes. We noticed that it had gotten warmer in
 the cockpit coming back than it was going out. And
 I remember going out when we manually positioned
 the ten-pin valve, but we had pretty good control
 over the glycol evap outlet temperature. So possibly
 that would be the thing to attack first rather than
 the radiators.
 04.19 47 49 cc Okay. We've got the back room boys looking at it.
' 04 19 47 5-7 IN? I guess if we do pick a time, though, we cught to
 pick a time that if something did go haywire, we
 could afford to boil . . . the rest of the way in,
 but still leave us enought time to fix - rig up the
 evap service if it didn't work.

 like trajectory considerations and all that sort
 of thing, too.
 04 lg 48 22 Lm Right. I think that the second derivative of
 the water boiler versus time plot will give us
 the optimum time to do it.

 04 20 25 43 cc Okay, Bill, and our BIOMED data still looks
 a little bit 'squirrelly. How about checking
 the blue signal conditioner on your BIOMED
 harness. You have one connector, should be
 the center package, has a blue connector on
 it. You kind of check that, and I don't
 know if you have changed the BIOMBD harness
 leads recently; if you have, this might have .
 caused our problem.

 on a different kind,of latch-up this time.
 What I'd like to do in order to make sure
 that we maintain voice CCMMis when you get
 it if you would, give us a call and tell us
 you have the music and any comment about its
 relative volume or anything like that. And
 if I get your call, then I'll call you back
 and tell you. And what will happen is when
 I go to talk to you we'll drop the music
 link. And we can go ahead and take over the
 switching of the antennas if you like.
 04 20 50 49 LMP okay. I'm in Bravo Dog switch configuration,
 and go ahead with the music. Be advised last
 time the fidelity was low, and the volume was
 too high.
 04 20 51 02 cc Okay. And if you'll give us the same kind of
 comment, hopefully not the same comment but
 the same type of evaluation when you pick it
 up this time.

 04 zz 17 56 cc Okay. We are getting ready to have a shift turn-
 over, and I vanted to go over a few items before
 I ao: On the midcourse correction nunber 6: right
 now, that looks like it is at most 0.3 a foot per
 second, so there will be no burn for midcourse
 number 6. Midcourse number 7 is a little larger,
 and we'll make a decision on that later. Your
 weather in landing site still reported as being good
 and the forecast to be --bout 2000 scattered and
 I2 000 broken, about the same numbers they gave
 Prank earlier. Visibility vi11 be about 10 miles,
 wave height about 4 feet. And I guess there is some
 scattered thundershowers, like less than 5 percent,
 that you should worry about. And they're 10 to
 30 percent maybe at 2000, broken as opposed to
 scattered; so it looks pretty fair. We have got

 things they would like to see tried with the filters.
 And I would like to read you what they have here
 and let you think about it; and in the next 10 hours,
 you can decide whether or not you think it is worth
 the effort. Basically, they would like to try using
 .
 a vhole different series of filters - -
 04 22 21 04 LAP Okay, Ken. I got something to write on. Was that
 c- .P52 at 18:30 or 19:30?

 04 22 '21 15 IMP Okay. I'm ready to copy on !FV.
 04 22 21 31 CC okay * Before you copy, let me read it all through
 to you here so you vi11 get the feel for what it
 is ve are talking about. The title of this little
 epistle is "TV and Film Photography Correlation
 %periment," and what they want to do is mount
 the TV camera with the telephoto lens on a bracket.
 in the rendezvous window and take a TV picture
 of the earth through the red and blu+ filters,
 lminute per filter; that means red and blue
 filters individually. Then they would like to
 C! take a TV picture cf the earth through through
 the red, in this case, the 25 Alfa filter combined
r

 Page 3
 vith the polarizing filter. Rotate the polarizing I
 filter through 360-degree increments, again 1 minute I
 per position. Then they'd like to take a TV picture
 of the moon vith the polarizing filter at 360-degree
 I moon-rotation increments and again, : minute per
 position. And to go with this, we would like 5;
 have Hasselblad pictures.
 04 22 22 44 LMP One minute.
 04 22 22 45 cc Okay. I am standing by.
 04 22 22 49 IMP Are those - when you were talking aboc-t'pictures
 through the polarizing filter, is that the TV pictures
*. through the polarizing filter?
 04 22 22 55 cc That's affirmative. All above was 'TJ.
 c
 04 22 22 59 IMP okay. Now the only thing - the only problem here
 is it's darn near impossible to aim that television
 camera ; the field of view is so narrow that it
 took three men and a boy ug here to get the thing
 pointed in the right direction. And we tried using
 cheving gum for a sight and everything else, and
 let me tell you that the odds of getting that thing
 in the earth is pretty smali.
 : 04 22 23 25 cc Okay. I think we weren't too clever in our ground
 callup as to how to point the spacecraft. For one
 thing I think we can do that a lot better next time
 now that we have stumbled through it once. I agree \

 with you - - r

 (ooss mm 1) Tape 78
 Page 4
C) .
 . 04 22 23 41 r.MP It's not the spacecraft; it's not the spacecraft
 that's hard to point, it's the camera. The bracket
 has sufficient slump in it that it can take the
 .
 camera out of field of view when configured thrcllgh
 the window. And it took a lot of microadjustments
 with a lot of coaching from the ground to get the
 thing in, and it was a real tough job. So I think
 you ought to take all this in mind; if you could
 possibly use the wide angle, you might be better off.
 04 22 24 14 cc Okay. I understand what you are saying now. I'-1
 run that back by the TV guys and see what they have
 .
 to say about that. In conjunction with the above,
CJ they wanted to take some Hasselblad pictures of the
 earth through the rendezvous window with the red
 and blue filter and black and white film, and then
 again through the polarizing filter, and this,is ail
 going to be used in order to try and correlate the
 !l!V and the regular film photography. So if you think
 .. it is a worthwhile thing, and you would like to give
 it a try, I'll run this by Jack and the TV cats and
 see if they would like.to get something out of it
 vith the wide angle, and we can talk about it a little
 later.
 04 22 25 05 rm Okay. Another thing to keep in mind is that we
 haven't si-en the moon - we didn't see a11 the uay
 out ) and we rarely see it going back. Ue have seen
 it once since we left, but we have uar.euvered the

 Page 5
 wrong way from a sighting attitude to the shortest
 way to mc; and to go from an earth view to a lunar
 view will take quite a bit of time and some RCS.
 So you might keep that in mind, too.
04 22 25 35 cc okay. I just wanted you to .be aware of this and
 think about it and what its implications to the
 flight plan might be, and I'll run this wide angle
 and comment about the moon back by and see which
 sections they think would be most appropriate.
 okay. On the EMS scroll, Frank wanted us to verify
 the order that he could expect to see the entry
 profile, and the first profile that comes up is
 labelled "Nonexit Number 2" and that is the short-
 range high-speed entry. The second thing that will
 come up is entitled "The 3500 Mile" irhich i; also
 high-speed entry, but it is the one you wo'lld use
 in event we go to the longer entry rznges. Then
 the third profile will be "Nonexit Entry Number 1,"
 and it will be followed by a forth 3509 rile. SO
 you have four entry profiles. Numbers 1 and 3, as
 you come to them, are the short ranges, and numbers 2
 and 4 are the long-range scrolls. On coldsoak,
 I think we talked about what we're going to do there,
 but somewhere inside of about an hour, ~'11 want
 to get into the coldsoak business. lie certainly

 something to keep in mind is the fact that they
 do see your water dumps and water boiling on your
 trajectory plot. It seems to be that it's a func-
 tion of their computational scheme rather than a
 function of the fact that the trajectory is being
 perturbed that much. So it looks like one time that
 we're going to consider, if we're going to do some
 of this water boiling, we may do it just prior to
 the midcourse after all the tracking is settied
 down and they know what the midcourse correction
 .
 trill be. Then in that period just prior to the
 midcourse we can do it, and they'll pick up their
 0 tracking agair following the midcourse correction.
 So if someone proposes that the - - It is probably
 nice to know that we are not throwing away our
 data at the most important time, that it is a func-
 tion of the computer program rather than so much
 a function of your trajectory being changed.
 04 22 28 04 IMP Let me ask you one thing then. Do you want a
 coldsoak sone',ime prior to the midcourse correction
 . for 1 hour. Is that what you're trying to tell me?
 0422.2812 . cc Not really. I think we are looking at that prior
 to the midcourse correction as being the time
 when we would like to check out the water boilers.
 The coldsoak does involve some water boiler, too,
 but that's going to be done right before entry vhcn
 these things are not going to be very sensitive,
 .
 .
 i

(Goss mm i) Tape 78
 Page 7
 and if we don't do it in 12 hours, it is not
 real clear where the coldsoak takes place or
 where you turn on the secondary water boiler.
 In looking through the eniry checklist tonight,
 we didn't find a place for that.
04 22 28 48 IalP Okay. Is it really clear that you need the cold
 soak? Ue kind of figured on sometime prior to
 SEP bringing up the secondary J3VAP, and also
 having the primary at that point sometime prior
 to that date on your suggestion.
04 22 29 06 cc Okay. We're talking about doing that like an hour
 prior to SEP; but in the pre-SRP check, one of the
 things we power down was the secondary loop. And
 they won't need to turn it back.
04 22 29 21 L24P Ye do that to save - -
04 22 2g 22 cc Right. We're doing that to keep our power profile
 where we want it. And then we're going to be turn-
 ing it back on sometime prior to entry. And the time
 to turn it on in entry, of course, isn't specifiec'
 because as you turn it on, the voltages show that
 they can hack it.
04 22 29 41 CD2 Hopetilly. right after separation.
04-22 29 43 cc That sounds like a real good place. Okay- I’m
 sure we're going to discuss that one a 1itLle bit

 04 22 30 17 cc That's as good as some of the explanetions.
 04 22 +o 26 IlP Yes, I think that's what they hashed out cc the
 ground, Ken.
 04 22 30 29 cc Okay. I think we all agree that we don't uant
 to try experimenting with it if we really don't
 know what it is we're looking at.

 I hope will be helpful.

 about that.
04 22 37 12 cc okay. ‘I don't think that would throw it away. I

 and again we won't be using the red and blue filters
 so we have our baseline.
 04 22 29 08 IMP Taking a picture of the earth with the Hasselblad
 is no big deal because it does swing by the earth
 now and then. But trying to get the TV and the
 Jiasselblad 411 pointed to the earth at the same
 time would really be tough.

 tionally, and 9 of them were in Youston on Christ-

 into our heart this Christmas day. Our best to

 from their secret honeymoon hideaway to have
 Christmas dinner with President-elect Nixon and
 l&e family. In lVew York city, the world's busi-
 est harbor was reduced to almost complete inac-
 tivity Christmas day, due to a 5-day old long-
 shoreman strike and a rare hiatus in shipping
 schedule. 100 ships arrived or left the harbor.
 Ferries, running on reduced holiday schedule,
 provided the only marine activity.
 05 oo 56 01 cc Here is an interesting little feature item that
 I/
c is kind of good to hear. It seems that up in
 Ann Arbor, Michigan, they have a new youth gang.

(Goss m 1) Tape 80
 Page 3
 It's called the Gilnet Gang. It roams the streets
 of Ann Arbor, acting in secret, and sometimes by-
 passing the law. They call themselves the Guerillas
 for Good. Some of the things they have done is,
 painted a bridge that was covered with obsceni-
 ties. They painted it one night. A condemned
 house with - it's popular with neighborhood chil-
 &en, but dangerous, was boarded up. Downtown
 planters unfilled because of a debate over which
 group was responsible, business'or government,
 were filled with flowers. A hedge, thought to
 be hampering vision, at busy intersrztion was
 trimmed, and the owner was angered. Trash along
 a portion of the Huron River was picked up. Mem-
 bers of the gang are anonymous teenagers who ask
 for no individual recognition. Their aim is to
 slice red tape, to get things - good things in
 their opinion - done. The organization has a .
 faint religious overtone. 1:'s sort of an ecu-
 menical group, said an assistant professor at
 the University of Michigan who acts as an informal
 sounding board for the gang's ideas. The name
 is from St. Peter, the Fisherman's Net. And it
 is remote enough not to be identified with any
 particular church. There is a thread 3f Robin
 Rood running through this thirg, said their

 teacher, who also prefers to remain anonymous.
 A lot of their activities are extra-legal. When
. the system bogs down, they directly administer
 good, rather than go through the red tape chan-
 nels. The gang is made up of about 55 high-
 school kids, boys and girls, and there's another
 ~CI or 59 who belonged to the gang before they
 graduated. The idea for the gang evolved from
 a trip to Detroit slum area, where a church
 group - youth group noted the way that street
 gangs operate. They were impressed with the
 -
 methods of operation and decided to org.&se for
 somewhat different reasons. "It was the chance
 to do things for the pure sake of giving," said
 the gang's advisor.
 05 oo 58 18 cc That is about it as far as the world and national
 news and the features is concerned. On the sport
 page, Hank Stram of the Kansas City Chiefs was
 named as the APL coach of the year. This is the
 second time for him in three seasons. The voting
 was done by an Associated Press panel of 30 sports
 writers snd sportscasters, three from each city.
 The nearest one to him was Weeb &bank. Other
 coach's that received votes were Sid Gilman of
 San Diego, and Lou Sabin of Denver. Ps for the

 Dick %rlinslcy booted a 23 yard field goal in
 the first quarter and it was all the North needed
 to beat the South Wednesday, in the Shrine's Col-
 lege All Star football game. Let's see, I guess
 the interesting things about this are that first
 downs, North 19, South 16; rushing, North 214,
 South 169; passing was North 96, South 109. So,
 all in all, it looks like they were evenly matched.

 05 03 n 28 cc Roger. Got some information for you on this
 PTC that we'll be going to right after this
 next P23 exercise. We'd like you this time to
 try the nose north attitude, that's pitch of 180,
 and a yaw of 315, and also we'd like to give
 another look at this mode free type of FTC and
 we think maybe we'll get a little bit of spin
 stabilization if we try it at 0.3 degrees per
 second on the roll rate rather thar. 0.1. So
 if you figure on doing &at. at 124:30 ~2'3.1 see
 what kind of information we can get out of it.
c) '. 05 03 23 14 CDR Okay. You know what I think of that, don't you?
 I'll be happy to do it, but I think it's play-
 ing games.
 05 03 23-22 cc Roger, Prank, you're burning right now 1.4 pounds

 'We're kind of interested to see if 0.3 degrees

 spin stabilization.
 05 03 23 40 Yes, I know. . I predict that it will not.
 05 03 23 45 Okay.
 05 03 23 48 Jerry, I'm a little concerned about the tempera-

 also the evaporator outlet temperature is up
 around 45 degrees. Do you have any trend that

 05 03 24 15 cc Prank, RECCM says everything looks nominal down
 here. You might try a change in your cabin
 temperature heat exchanger there.
 05 03 24 26 CDR No, we don't have the fans on, but what we
 have done is put up a window shade. That
 seems to help it. We've been getting a lot
 more sun in the cabin this way.
 05 03 24 35 cc Roger. We'll keep a sharp eye on things and
 keep you posted.

 on that.
 05 03 25 15 cc Okay.
 05 03 25 49 CDR I think it would be very difficult to extrap-
 olate anything that you are getting out of
 this bit business to a L&l-command module com-

 05 03 26 20 cc Okay.
 05 03 26 27 CMP Jerry, what I'm kind of curious about is the

 doing, we have a lot more fuel. 5

 in your PTC driving, we've computed that as you
 look out plus X in the COAS or just out the win-
 dow, you should be pointed right at Acrux when
 you're in a perfect PTC attitude. We don't know
 if that's a help to you or not, but ue thought
 you might enjoy trying an alternate mode of keep
 ing the attitude under control.

 it's hardly worth the trouble to scootch way up

 be on-scene commander. Recoveries 1, 2, and 3
 are SH3 Alfas, and they go with the Yorktown, so

05 22 57 17 IMP Ken, we got two things going here which make this
 suit heat exchanger flow a little different. One
 of them is we are not doing a coldsoak, and the
 other one is we are powering down thz secondary
 loop prior to SEP. An; I wonder if it is a good
 idea to have the suit heat exchanger only on a
 . secondary loop in that case. And plus the fact
 that we haven't got any cabin heat exchanger.
05 22 57 45 cc I dm't think that vas the intent, Bill. What
 they had in mind, we have the suit heat exchanger
 on both loops; and if they got too cold, you could
 use the panel switching to shut down the primary .
 loop through the heat exchanger. But in any event,
 you would always have something going to the suit
 heat exchanger. I recognize that we are going to
 be shutting down the secondary heat exchanger
 pre-SEP and then turning it back on prior to entry,
 but the idea was to have both primary- and secondary
 loops on the suit heat exchanger simultaneously.
05 22 58 24 LMP Yes, my checklist doesn't reflect that. I think
 that's a good idea because we are a little suspect
 of our cabin fans and don't plan to use them.
