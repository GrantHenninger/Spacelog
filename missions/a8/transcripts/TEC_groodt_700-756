05 08 48 11 CC       Howdy.
05 08 48 14    LMP      Okay.      Somebody said                something        about      checking

                              out the evaporator                  - evaporators.              What do you

                              want .io do?
05 08 48 20 CC       Roger.       Before         we get        too far      along,       we'd         like

                              to see,      essentially               with     the secondary                 evaporx-

                              tor     check,     what we got on the redundant                                compo-

05 08 48 31 LMP            Okay.      Stand by.                     ,
05 08 48 33 CC Roger.       EECOM says to be sure and let                               it     go for

                              at least         5 minutes.
05 08 48 39 LMP Roger.       Now you want to check out the primary

                              evaporator          also,      or did you decide                 it's          not

                              necessary?
05 08 48 46 CC I guess they              decided       it's     not necessary,                 Bill.
05 08 48 52 LMP Okay.
05 08 49 31 LMP            Okay.      Secondary           glycol          loops    coming on the line.
05 08 49 34 CC Roger,     Bill.
05 08 49 59 LMP And the      secondary             evap's       coming on the line.

                          separation?             It    looks         like   if     we do,have              a cabin

                          fan problem,            we won't        be able           to do a full-blown

05 08 54 05 CC    Veil,       right      now, Bill,            in the checklist,                   we're

                          shoving        this     activation             at about minus 1 hour.

                          Let me check with                   EECOM for           R minute         and see if

                          they       got any more words considering                               the cabin

                          fan situation.
05 08 54 19 LMP   Roger.
05 08 54 59 CC    Apollo       8,     Houston.          Looks like            a good time.                 One

05 08 55 10       LMP   Okay.        It     won't     do any good,               then,         to fool      around

                                      little           bit         of good so we'd                 just           as soon go through

05 14 38 20 CC       Okay.         Understand.                 If     it'll          be any help              to you

                            in your            PTC driving,             we've         computed            that       as you

                            look       out plus          X in the            COAS or just                 out the win-

                            dow, you should                  be pointed                right       at Acrux             when

                            you're            in a perfect             PTC attitude.                    We don't           know

                             if      that's      a help         to you or not,                   but ue thought

                            you might            enjoy        trying         an alternate                 mode of keep

                             ing the attitude                   under        control.
05 14 38 40 I.MP      Okay.            From my present                position,             we're           going     to

                             might        appreciate            knowing.

05 14 39 07 CC         Can you see it             all         right?
05 14 39 09 LMP        Yes,    I think          so.        There's     a star     out there
                                             anyway.
05 14 40 58 LMP        Houston,       Apollo          8.       Do you read?
05 14 40 59 CC         Go ahead,        Bill.
05 14 41 02 LMP        Actually,        Mike,         it's       so easy to do it            with     the

                                              eight-ball        within            a reasonable         sloppy       limit     that

                                              it's    hardly      worth             the trouble      to scootch            way up

                                              in the seat          to look            out the COAS, and it's                enough

                                              light       in the cockpit                where the star          really       isn't

                                              too easy to see.                      So I'm kind      of inclined            to use

                                              the OFR technique                    here where you can see the                     rest

                                              of the instrument                     panel.
05 14 41 27 CC         Okay.
05 14 41 41 LMP        I thought        you were an all-weather                     pilot.
05 14 41 44 CC         Well    now, you just                  caused Flight       down here           to
                                              get a "Got Ya" on CAP COMM and FAO.

                          starting           the       initial          stowage,          and we all        feel     very

                          Well.
05 20 37 12 CC   Okay.
05 20 37 17 CC    Okay.         And we'd            like        to - guess we need a PRD

                          reading        from you.                 And we'll           be needing          one in

                          the neighborhood                       of 145-hour           period,       somewhere

                              MAX lift             point,         you will        have about             the      same thing,

                              and altimeter                  is the same down the range.                                  As you

                              go further              to the east,               the weather             should           improve

                              slightly;              there        is no problem            uith      thunderstorms

05 21 47 40 CDR    The LMP's               reads      0;64; I believe                  it's      been that

                                       way throughout                    the flight.               The CMP's reads                      0.11,

                                       that's           1.11.

                        it     is a misprint;              it     should       read the PLSS fill                   valve

                         rather      than the REPRESS valve,                          and we should             be

                         going     to the FILL position                       as opposed to going                    to OZ.

                         fire     as a result               of attitude             correction,          you might

                         want to take              the manual attitude                    switches        to

                         ACCEL COMMAND or MINIMAL IMPULSE. And again       on

                                            might      wait          about         5 minutes          or so before             you initiate

                                            the      secondary               loop.
05 22 52 38 LMP    Wait      5 minutes               from what?              From the time                the primary

05 22 57 17 LMP       Ken, we got two things                          going       here which                   make this

                           suit      heat     exchanger             flow      a little               different.               One

                           of them is we are not doing                                a coldsoak,                   and the

                           other      one is we are powering                           down thz               secondary

                           loop      prior      to SEP.             An; I wonder                if      it     is a good

                           idea      to have the suit                  heat         exchanger                only     on a

                       .   secondary          loop      in that            case.         And plus              the     fact

                           that     we haven't            got any cabin                  heat         exchanger.
05 22 57 45 CC        I dm't        think         that        vas the          intent,           Bill.           What

                           they     had in mind,               we have the suit                       heat          exchanger

                           on both       loops;         and if         they         got too           cold,          you could

                           use the panel               switching            to shut           down the primary                      .

                           loop      through          the heat         exchanger.                   But in any event,

                           you would          always          have something                  going           to the      suit

                           heat     exchanger.                I recognize              that      we are going                  to

                           be shutting            down the            secondary              heat       exchanger

                           pre-SEP       and then turning                     it     back on prior                    to entry,

                           but      the idea was to have both                            primary-             and secondary

                           loops      on the suit              heat     exchanger              simultaneously.
05 22 58 24 LMP       Yes, my checklist                   doesn't             reflect           that.           I think

                           that's      a good idea because                          we are a little                    suspect

                           of our cabin               fans and don't                  plan     to use them.

05 23 17 41 LMP   Roger.              I don't             expect        it    to boil,             though.           Do you?
05 23 17 45 CC    Okay,         Bill.              We are hoping               that      it        will      there.                It

                                   looks         like         we will               have had a stable                  attitude               for

                                   sometime,             and we anticipate                       that          it    will      be warm

                                   enough to make it                            boil.         That     is the reason                   it's

                                   suggested             if         it     is boiling,           that      you wait.                   If      it

                                   isn't        , go ahead and turn                           on the secondary                   loop.
05 23 18 04 LMP   Okay.           Well,            that's           where I was confused.                           I am

                          our readout             has gone from 100 percent                                down to 56

                          in the last             couple        of minutes.

06 00 00 17   CMP    We're     reading          about       50 percent               right        now.

06 00 00 22   CC     Roger.          That     correlates             with        what we see.               Have

                          you done anything                   to change configuration?                            Over.

06 00 01 10 CC     Jim,     did you mean you could                            visually          see it?
06 00 01 14 CMP    Yes, we're          - oh, stand by,                    Ken.         Bill      just     dumped

                          urine,      so that           might        have been urine                   we were seeing.
06 00 01 45 CMP    Bill     just     shut the potable                     inlet,         Ken.
