05 08 26 48    LMP            That's a pretty good little television camera,

05 08 26 50    CC             It sure is. With the right filters on it, it's
                              great. That was a Schmitt input.

05 08 48 14    LMP            Okay. Somebody said something about checking
                              out the evaporator - evaporators. What do you
                              want to do?
05 08 48 20    CC             Roger. Before we get too far along, we'd like
                              to see, essentially with the secondary 
                              evaporator check, what we got on the redundant 
                              components check.
05 08 48 31    LMP            Okay. Stand by.
05 08 48 33    CC             Roger. EECOM says to be sure and let it go for
                              at least 5 minutes.
05 08 48 39    LMP            Roger. Now you want to check out the primary
                              evaporator also, or did you decide it's not
                              necessary?
05 08 48 46    CC             I guess they decided it's not necessary, Bill.
05 08 48 52    LMP            Okay.
05 08 49 31    LMP            Okay. Secondary glycol loops coming on the line.
05 08 49 34    CC             Roger, Bill.
05 08 49 59    LMP            And the secondary evap's coming on the line.

05 08 53 48    LMP            Alright. What do you have in mind here in the
                              way of activating the secondary loop prior to
                              separation? It looks like if we do have a cabin
                              fan problem, we won't be able to do a full-blown
                              coldsoak. Is there anything that we can do that'11
                              do any good?
05 08 54 05    CC             Well, right now, Bill, in the checklist, we're
                              showing this activation at about minus 1 hour.
                              Let me check with EECOM for R minute and see if
                              they got any more words considering the cabin
                              fan situation.
05 08 54 19    LMP            Roger.
05 08 54 59    CC             Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like a good time. One
                              hour before SEP - entry interface would be fine.
05 08 55 10    LMP            Okay. It won't do any good, then, to fool around
                              with these cabin temp valves. ...
05 08 55 21    CC             Bill, stand by. You're - got a lot of background
                              noise.
05 08 55 39    CC             Go ahead now, Bill.
05 08 55 40    LMP            Read me now, Jerry?
05 08 55 41    CC             Loud and clear.
05 08 55 45    LMP            Okay. This coldsoak is built around the premise
                              that you've got a cabin heat exchanger, in my
Tape 85 
Page 3 
                              view; and if you haven't got a cabin heat 
                              exchanger, I'm wondering just what you can do.
05 08 56 02    CC             He's thinking.
05 08 56 28    CC             Apollo 8, Houston. We think it'll still do a
                              little bit of good so we'd just as soon go through
                              with it.
05 08 56 39    LMP            Okay. Even bypassing the suit heat exchanger and 
                              that part of it too, huh?
05 08 56 44    CC             That's affirmative.
05 08 56 48    LMP            Okay.
05 08 56 49    CC             Also, Bill, your secondary loop is looking good.
05 08 56 54    LMP            Okay. We just had 5 minutes. I'll deactivate
                              it now.

05 09 08 37    LMP            Okay. We wanted - we wanted to put it out prior

05 09 23 03    CMP            We've been looking at that, too. It keeps 
                              wandering off in pitch for some reason more than yaw.
                              I was just about ready to go back to it again. I
                              had to go back one time, and I was just seeing
                              hov far she would drift. I thought it would drift
                              out a ways and come back by itself, but it is not
                              doing it.

Tape 85 
Page 6 
                              like the second star, number 11, has a trunnion
                              angle right out to the limit, about 49.7 degrees.
                              And we're thinking it might be a good idea to
                              switch you over to star 1, which has a much 
                              smaller trunnion angle. What do you think? Star 1

05 14 38 20    CC             Okay. Understand. If it'll be any help to you
                              in your PTC driving, we've computed that as you
                              look out plus X in the COAS or just out the 
                              window, you should be pointed right at Acrux when
                              you're in a perfect PTC attitude. We don't know
                              if that's a help to you or not, but we thought
                              you might enjoy trying an alternate mode of 
                              keeping the attitude under control.
05 14 38 40    LMP            Okay. From my present position, we're going to 
                              have to move Acrux a little bit.
05 14 38 50    CC             Well, whatever you think. We just thought you
                              might appreciate knowing.

05 14 39 09    LMP            Yes, I think so. There's a star out there
                              anyway.
05 14 40 58    LMP            Houston, Apollo 8. Do you read?
05 14 40 59    CC             Go ahead, Bill.
05 14 41 02    LMP            Actually, Mike, it's so easy to do it with the
                              eight-ball within a reasonable sloppy limit that
                              it's hardly worth the trouble to scootch way up
                              in the seat to look out the COAS, and it's enough
                              light in the cockpit where the star really isn't
                              too easy to see. So I'm kind of inclined to use
                              the IFR technique here where you can see the rest
                              of the instrument panel.

                              The recovery forces: ship will be Yorktown; the
                              aircraft will be Airboss number 1 and 2, and
                              Recoveries 1, 2, and 3. The estimated time to a
                              target point: the ship is - Yorktown is on the
                              target point, Airboss aircraft 15 minutes and will
                              be on-scene commander. Recoveries 1, 2, and 3
                              are SH3 Alfas, and they go with the Yorktown, so
                              they are at the target point. All of them have
                              swimmers aboard. If the recovery aircraft do not
                              hear from the spacecraft; they will go ahead and

                              the 2000 foot scattered at the target point may
                              have a 6000 foot broken layer above that. At the
                              MAX lift point, you will have about the same thing,
                              and altimeter is the same down the range. As you
                              go further to the east, the weather should improve
                              slightly; there is no problem with thunderstorms
                              or rain showers in any of your recovery area.

05 21 47 40    CDR            The LMP's reads 0.64; I believe it's been that
                              way throughout the flight. The CMP's reads 0.11,
                              that's 1.11.

05 21 48 37    CDR            Okay. Go ahead, Ken. What else do you want to
                              talk about?
05 21 48 41    CC             Okay. To make everybody happy, we can use an
                              estimate of the number of hours sleep the people
                              got.

                              Anders got about 5 hours, and Jim Love11 got about
                              five, and I got about five and a half or six.
05 21 49 09    CC             Sounds good. Okay. We went through an exercise
                              with the mockup on the preentry preparations, and
                              
Tape 93 
Page 4
                              we noticed that in the LMP's checklist on page S-12,
                              when you go to top off the repress bottles, I believe
                              it is a misprint; it should read the PLSS fill valve
                              rather than the REPRESS valve, and we should be
                              going to the FILL position as opposed to going to ON.
05 21 49 47    CDR            Roger. That's what we do.
05 21 49 51    CC             Okay. And on - go ahead.
05 21 50 01    CDR            Go ahead. We agree that's what we do.
05 21 50 04    CC             Okay. On page E-7 of the entry checklist and under
                              step 34, as long as you have panel 382 open, that's
                              a convenient time to go ahead and have the 
                              evaporator water controls, both primary and secondary, to
                              AUTO, and the suit heat exchanger for the secondary
                              glycol to FLOW.
05 21 50 27    CDR            Those items are already accomplished.
05 21 50 29    CC             Very good. On page E-9, when you are getting
                              ready to transfer the RCS to the command module
                              position, if you want to avoid having the engines
                              fire as a result of attitude correction, you might
                              want to take the manual attitude switches to
                              ACCEL COMMAND or MINIMAL IMPULSE. And again on
                              E-9 Alfa at step 41 Bravo, if you want to go back
                              to attitude hold, bring your manual attitude
                              switches back to RATE.
05 21 51 13    CDR            What was that last step?
05 21 51 15    CC             Step 41 Bravo on page-E-9 Alfa. It's if you decide
                              to use either MINIMAL IMPULSE or ACCEL COMMAND of
Tape 93 
Page 5 
                              page E-9, step 41 Bravo would be a good place
                              to go back to RATE COMMAND.
05 21 51 31    CDR            Okay. We do a purge or - -

05 22 51 49    LMP            I am just - It is my understanding that we are to
                              bring up the secondary loop at 1 hour prior to SEP,
                              isn't that right?
05 22 51 54    CC             That is affirmative, about page Echo 9.
05 22 52 10    LMP            Okay.
05 22 52 16    CC             And Bill, ... suggested if we have the water
                              boiler going on the primary loop, that you - you
                              might wait about 5 minutes or so before you initiate
                              the secondary loop.
05 22 52 38    LMP            Wait 5 minutes from what? From the time the primary
                              loop starts or from 1 hour?
05 22 52 43    CC             From the time the primary loop starts; this will
                              give you a check to see if it had a chance to dry
                              out or not.
05 22 53 04    LMP            Oh, I am with you. Okay.
05 22 53 09    CC             And for your information, we already have a VHF
                              downlink. It's poor quality, but we do have
                              contact.
05 22 53 22    LMP            Okay. We haven't turned anything over to VHF yet.
05 22 53 25    CC             Okay.
05 22 53 27    LMP            We tried to call you on the VHF though, Ken.
05 22 53 30    CC             Roger. I say, the quality is pretty poor; they
                              may not be able to understand you.

05 22 57 17    LMP            Ken, we got two things going here which make this
                              suit heat exchanger flow a little different. One
                              of them is we are not doing a coldsoak, and the
                              other one is we are powering down the secondary
                              loop prior to SEP. And I wonder if it is a good
                              idea to have the suit heat exchanger only on a
                              secondary loop in that case. And plus the fact 
                              that we haven't got any cabin heat exchanger.
05 22 57 45    CC             I don't think that vas the intent, Bill. What
                              they had in mind, we have the suit heat exchanger
                              on both loops; and if they got too cold, you could
                              use the panel switching to shut down the primary .
                              loop through the heat exchanger. But in any event,
                              you would always have something going to the suit
                              heat exchanger. I recognize that we are going to
                              be shutting down the secondary heat exchanger
                              pre-SEP and then turning it back on prior to entry,
                              but the idea was to have both primary and secondary
                              loops on the suit heat exchanger simultaneously.
05 22 58 24    LMP            Yes, my checklist doesn't reflect that. I think
                              that's a good idea because we are a little suspect
                              of our cabin fans and don't plan to use them.

05 23 16 24    LMP            I am still a little bit confused on that- on this
                              activating the secondary loop. You indicated
                              inactivating it at 1 hour or 5 minutes after the
                              primary evaporator comes on the line. My checklist
                              shows that the primary evaporator probably won't
                              come on the line until we bypass the radiators.
                              Have you got something else in mind I don't
                              know about?
05 23 16 56    CC             Okay, Bill. We passed up an update some time back
                              on page E-9 step 38 right at the beginning, and
                              you have got a final GET drift check. And between
                              there and the step 39 where it says terminate CM
                              RCS preheat, that was the place we wanted to activate
                              the primary loop by putting the glycol evaporator
                              water switch to AUTO and the glycol evaporator
                              steam pressure to AUTO.

05 23 17 41    LMP            Roger. I don't expect it to boil, though. Do you?
05 23 17 45    CC             Okay, Bill. We are hoping that it will there. It
                              looks like we will have had a stable attitude for
                              sometime, and we anticipate that it will be warm
                              enough to make it boil. That is the reason it's
                              suggested if it is boiling, that you wait. If it
                              isn't, go ahead and turn on the secondary loop.

                              percent, and we had our switch on waste so we don't
                              know whether it dropped from a higher value or not.

06 00 05 15    CC             That's affirmative; ours has stabilized now. It

                              you to box 6, but I don't really think that's the
                              problem because the waste tank quantity hasn't
                              changed any. Over.

                              we do about the waste tank, so just in case there
                              is a problem somewhere, I'm going to shut the potable
                              tank off and leave the waste tank inlet valve open.
