 messages. It'll have no effect on either your
 computer or your panel switch configuration.
 What you might see will be the S-band noise that's
 associated with the break lock. However, you
 should still have a good signal on your power
 meter. This is not a loss of signal, but rather
 just a loss of the voice modulation, and I'll
 do you a mark just before we do that so that you
 can turn your S-band volume down if you so desire,
 and we'll be back up in this mode that we're in
 now in 2-1/2 minutes.
00 12 11 13 LMP Roger.
00 12 11 31 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're about to disable the
 voice modulation on uplink, and we'll be back up
 no later than 12:31.
00 12 14 26 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Voice check.
00 12 14 29 LMP Read you five-by, Houston.
00 12 14 37 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 12 14 40 LMP Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear and am
 with you. Completed our second test.
00 12 14 47 LMP Okay.
00 12 14 57 CC Okay. Our next test will be a test of the uplink
 voice and ranging with downlink voice and ranging
 and on low bit rate, so we'll be changing bit
 rate on you, and we'll be making a voice check
 in the middle.

00 12 15 12 LMP Okay. You've about had it on the high gain.
 You might try to get it in, but it's going to
 hit the scan limit at any second.
00 12 15 28 CC Okay, Apollo 8. Looks like we'll get our information
 before we lose the high gain.
00 12 15 34 LMP Okay. We'll just leave it go.
00 12 15 36 CC Roger.
00 12 16 21 LMP They got the scan limit. We'll let it go,
 Houston, until it breaks lock.
00 12 16 33 CC Okay, Apollo 8. Go ahead and switch to the OMNI.
00 12 16 38 LMP How're you doing with your test?
00 12 16 40 CC Okay. We've got three-fifths of the test. We'll
 have to pick up the rest next time we get a look
 at high gain.
00 12 16 47 LMP Okay.
00 12 26 56 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 12 26 59 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
00 12 27 01 CMP Roger. Reading on P21 at 269 10 indicates a
 parallel of about 67.4 miles. I guess we can
 carry her.
00 12 27 12 CC You guys are getting pretty good.
00 12 27 16 CMP That's a lot better than our first answer.
00 12 27 23 LMP We don't care if we're right, just so MPAD
 is right.
00 12 38 20 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 12 38 23 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.

Tape 10
Page 11
00 12 38 26 CMP Roger. I'd like to ask a question about this
 TLI plus 11 maneuver that we copied. In the
 remarks, you put P37, DELTA-V 7900. Is this
 the DELTA-V that we would use with P37?
00 12 38 43 CC Okay. That's the option that you use with minimum
 time.
00 12 38 51 CMP Roger. What I'd like to do is check on our P37
 with your TLI maneuver update.
END OF TAPE

Tape 11
Page 1
-- -- -- -- CC Okay, Apollo 8. We'd like to make sure that
 we don't have a misunderstanding that this
 7900 feet per second is the DELTA-V. It's not
 associated with the high speed per feet work
 around procedure. This is just a standard P37
 DELTA-V.
00 12 40 22 LMP Roger. But was that the DELTA-V that you used
 to give us the TLI plus 11? Okay.
00 12 40 32 CC Okay. That's not the one that the maneuver PAD
 was based on. That's the number you put in for
 the minimum time.
00 12 40 44 LMP Roger. Understand.
00 12 40 46 CC Okay. Sounds like a good idea if you want to
 go ahead and check out the 37. And we're
 standing by to work on COMM as soon as that high
 gain is available.
00 12 40 54 LMP Roger.
00 12 44 54 LMP Okay. Houston, you got the high gain.
00 12 46 03 LMP Houston, do you read? Apollo 8. Over.
00 12 46 22 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 12 46 25 LMP Roger. High gain yours.
00 12 46 29 CC Okay. And if you're ready, we are. We'll go
 right ahead with our COMM checks.
00 12 46 34 LMP Go ahead.
00 12 46 40 CC We're starting in now on our fourth test. Like
 for you to put your TELEMETRY INPUT switch to
 PCM HIGH.

Tape 11
Page 2
00 12 46 59 LMP It's in HIGH.
00 12 47 01 CC Okay. And now we're going to switch uplink to
 the upvoice backup for about 2 minutes, and it may
 take a couple of seconds when you hear the upvoice
 lost. So you can place your up-telemetry switch
 to upvoice backup, and in the event that all of
 this doesn't work out too well, I'm reading 12:47
 on my clock now, and let's meet back in our present
 configuration no later than 12:50.
00 12 47 33 LMP Roger. On upvoice backup.
00 12 47 35 CC Okay. Thank you.
00 12 48 16 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 12 48 20 LMP Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
00 12 48 22 CC That's pretty good. That's upvoice backup,
 and will you confirm that you're in NARROW BEAM on
 high gain?
00 12 48 31 LMP Roger. NARROW BEAM.
00 12 48 33 CC Okay. Thank you. We're going to continue tracking
 and watching high-gain antenna for a couple of
 minutes. Then I'll give you a call when we're
 ready to go back.
00 12 48 50 LMP Roger.
00 12 50 03 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We have completed this test.
 We'll be switching back to full uplink. When you
 hear the noise associated with the loss of modulation,
 you can go back from the up-telemetry switch
 to DATA.

Tape 11
Page 3
00 12 50 16 LMP Thank you.
00 12 50 51 LMP All the way.
00 12 50 52 CC Okay. Loud and clear.
00 12 50 59 LMP How's everything looking down there?
00 12 51 01 CC Real fine. We've just got one to go here if
 you'll put your telemetry input PCM switch to LOW.
00 12 51 09 LMP Roger. Go in LOW.
00 12 51 12 CC Okay. We'll be in that configuration for about
 2 minutes, and then we'll be completed with the
 COMM test.
00 12 51 19 LMP Roger.
00 12 51 20 CC I have some service module RCS quantities if you
 would like to take them sometime and check them
 against your onboard calculations.
00 12 51 31 LMP Stand by.
00 12 52 20 LMP Roger. Ready to copy. Could you give quad A,
 B, C, end D in that order?
00 12 52 24 CC Okay. Will do. And I'll give you weights in
 pounds and percentages. Quad A 231 for 76 percent.
00 12 52 31 LMP Roger. Stand by. What time is that for?
00 12 52 41 CC Oh, 12 plus 15.
00 12 53 06 LMP Okay. Got it.
00 12 53 08 CC Okay. Quad Bravo 251, 82 percent. Quad Charlie
 240, 79 percent.
00 12 53 20 LMP Slow down.

Tape 11
Page 4
00 12 53 29 CC Quad Delta 245, 81 percent. P and C advises
 that these numbers are still good even though it
 is a 12:15 time. And we are completed with the
 COMM test. You can take your high-gain antenna
 and go back to MEDIUM.
00 12 53 57 LMP Roger. MEDIUM.
00 12 54 36 CC Apollo 8, we would like to dump your tape again,
 if you are not using it. And the reason we want
 to do this is we have some - we didn't completely
 get dumped before the burn. We would like to get
 that and get the rest of the burn data. There is
 no hurry on it. We can do it whenever it is convenient
 for you.
00 12 54 54 LMP You got it.
00 12 54 57 CC Okay. Thank you.
00 12 56 18 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Do you call?
00 12 56 22 LMP Negative, negative. Negative, Houston.
00 12 56 26 CC Okay. Thank you. Say, we're curious about what
 you did with your Mae West?
00 12 56 52 LMP We thought we might bleed the CO<sub>2</sub> out into the
 vacuum connector here in our next water dump. We
 forgot it the last time. Did you copy?
00 12 57 10 CC Roger, Doesn't seem like there is any problem
 with going ahead and dumping it in the cockpit
 if you like.
00 12 57 37 LMP It is CO<sub>2</sub>, isn't it?

Tape 11
Page 5
00 12 57 39 CC That's affirm.
00 12 58 15 CC Apollo
 8, Houston. We asked it again, and it
 looks like no problems at all with going ahead
 and bleeding it down in the cockpit. And then
 if you need it again on entry or after entry,
 well, we can blow it up with oral tube.
00 12 58 33 LMP Roger. Understand.
00 13 02 11 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 13 03 10 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 13 04 18 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 13 06 12 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 13 06 16 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Read you loud and clear.
 How us?
00 13 06 19 CC Okay. Loud and clear. Didn't get you there for
 a while.
00 13 06 24 LMP We have been reading you all along, Houston.
00 13 06 26 CC Roger. Did you attempt to transmit, or were you
 just not getting through?
00 13 06 35 LMP Roger. We attempted to transmit, and it sounded
 like you had a stuck mike there for a little while.
00 13 06 46 CC Okay. That shouldn't make any difference to us on
 that Duplex mode. Okay. What I was calling for,
 Apollo 8 - we have got a maneuver PAD that is TLI
 plus 25. I would like to read up to you when you
 are ready for it.

Tape 11
Page 6
00 13 07 24 LMP Go ahead, Houston. TLI plus 25.
00 13 07 28 CC Okay. TLI plus 25, and this will be an SPS/G&N.

00 13 10 35 CMP Houston, Apollo 8. Maneuver PAD as follows. How
 do you read? Over.
00 13 10 40 CC Loud and clear.

00 13 12 12 CC That's correct, Apollo 8. And we'll have a couple
 more things for you before too long. We're
 working an a flyby PAD at this time. And we're
 going to be talking some more to you about the
 problem of looking at stars in the sextant and

Tape 11
Page 7
 telescope. And what we'd like to do as soon as
 the black team comes on the MOCR, while we have
 two teams here, we would like to get a rehash
 from you on exactly what you see and what you
 don't see and under what conditions, and see if
 we can define it so that everyone here understands
 what you've been telling us. And if you have
 any comments concerning the timeline - knowing
 that we got off our timeline before the burn -
 if you have any comments about that method of
 getting back on schedule, we'd like to hear
 those, too.
00 13 13 06 CDR Roger. We have one request. CDR would like to
 get clearance to take a Seconal.
00 13 13 21 CC Okay, Apollo. That's a GO.
00 13 13 29 LMP Roger. And, Houston, this is 8. We might go
 over our future NAV sighting schedule if it's
 going to be revised at all.
00 13 13 45 CC Okay, Apollo 8. No planned revisions.
00 13 13 50 LMP Roger.
00 13 20 02 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 13 20 05 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
00 13 20 07 CC Okay. Have your flyby PAD now so I can give that
 to you whenever you're ready for it.
00 13 20 18 CMP Stand by. Ready to copy.
00 13 20 36 CC Apollo 8. Here we go on a flyby maneuver

00 13 25 05 CMP Understand. 550.
00 13 25 08 CC That's affirm, and that's perilune.
00 13 25 12 CMP Roger.
00 13 27 13 CC Apollo 8, Houston,
00 13 27 17 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
00 13 27 19 CC Okay. We've completed the dump and the tape
 recorder is yours, and we listened to the call

Tape 11
Page 9
 data voice playback, and you've been given a GO
 for your first test in creative writing.
00 13 27 36 CMP Roger. Are we in low bit rate now?
00 13 27 43 CC That's negative. You're in high bit, and you
 understand that it's your tape recorder?
00 13 27 53 CMP Roger. Are you going to stay in high bit all
 along, or are you going to be back to low here
 soon not that it matters much to us, really.
00 13 28 12 CC Okay. We plan to stay in high bit rate. We were
 going to ask you if it made my difference, and
 you read our minds. That's pretty good for 63K.
00 13 28 22 CMP Roger. That's an altitude record for mind reading.
00 13 30 59 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 13 31 01 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
00 13 31 04 LMP Roger. Onboard calculations indicate that at
 13 hours 30 minutes GET we are not 64 200 miles
 above the earth. That's using alternate slide
 rule.
00 13 31 24 CC We've got 63 855.
00 13 31 37 LMP Houston, this is Apollo 8. We're going to try to
 keep the conversation down here for a while so
 the CDR can go to sleep.
00 13 31 45 CC Okay. We would like to get some comments from
 you before you sign off concerning the telescope,
 sextant, and verification that you have done
 something with the CO<sub>2</sub> in your Mae West and
 comment on the window status.

Tape 11
Page 10
00 13 32 06 CMP Roger. Is it a requirement that we do something
 with the CO<sub>2</sub> at this time? Over.
00 13 32 11 CC No. That is negative.
00 13 32 14 CMP Roger. We have maintained the same condition.
 We have left it as it was, and it will take care
 of it later.
00 13 32 21 CC Okay.
00 13 32 32 CMP Let me at this time go over the comments about
 the navigation as I see it so far.
00 13 32 37 CC Go.
00 13 32 42 CMP In the beginning, the operation with the S-IVB
 precluded immediate starting up of our sightings
 as we had scheduled since we had another evasive
 maneuver. The dumping of the S-IVB caused a
 tremendous amount of - of pseudo stars in the
 area which made an optics calibration practically
 impossible. The method which we had worked out
 did not seem to work too well. The method which
 I finally used was to go into P23, go to Sirius,
 which was our brightest star, get the shaft and
 trunnion, and then fly the spacecraft up to Sirius
 to use that for the optics CAL, which we did at a
 later time. With regards to light scatter, it
 appears that at almost any attitude during our
 passive thermal control, we are receiving light
 scattering in the scanning telescope. It takes

Tape 11
Page 11
 the form mostly of a wide band of light right
 across the center of the scope about 10 degrees
 either direction of zero. It is very difficult to
 see stars in this area. The realignments have
 been good. I have been able to pick up the star
 in the sextant to do the alignment, but I was not
 able to identify the star which we used in such
 cases as Regor or Menkent in the scanning telescope.
 The first star sighting which I took of
 the earth showed a very indistinct horizon. But
 there did appear to be a very - or somewhat sharp
 line between what appeared to be the earth's horizon
 and the atmosphere. The landmark line-of-sight
 filter appeared to help out this horizon
 definition. There is a very hazy and indistinct
 horizon through - between the space and the top
 of the atmosphere itself, and this is a very difficult
 one to use. As I said before, at times,
 looking at the moon with the Sun in the near
 vicinity, the area around the moon, the space
 around the moon is not dark, but is a light - appears
 as a light blue. And this is also the same
 case as looking into the sextant during alignments
 with the star - with the sun in somewhat vicinity
 of the optics. However, I have no difficulty in
 finding these stars in the sextant. I also had
 no difficulty in spotting the stars I used, such

Tape 11
Page 12
 as Sirius, Procyon, or Canopus against the earth
 during our star-horizon measurements. I can see
 all three of those stars against the earth background.
 I believe it will be very difficult to
 do a backup GDC alignment using the north set
 stars, since Navi is not too bright of a star.
 I was able to spot star constellations in the
 scanning telescope if they were very bright and
 well known, such as Cetus and Orion, stars of
 this nature. I was not able to perceive other
 constellations. That's about the only comments
 I have at this time. Over.
00 13 36 48 CC Okay. Fine; thank you very much.
00 13 36 55 LMP We are going to do - Houston - future maneuvers
 for P53 in a lower - slower mode of AUTO maneuver.
 Essentially, we are going to load the DAP with
 11101 to save fuel.
00 13 37 16 CC Roger. That will be a 11101 DAP load.
00 13 37 20 LMP Roger. We are going to try to save fuel that way.
00 13 37 23 CC Good show.
00 13 37 29 LMP With respect to the window, Houston: the windows
 1 and 5 have moderate haze on them. Satisfactory
 for visual observation, but possibly not for
 photography. Windows 2 and 4 are clear. Window
 3 is almost opaque. Over.
00 13 37 53 CC Okay. Thank you.

Tape 11
Page 13
00 13 37 57 LMP And how is battery B looking to you?
00 13 38 27 CC Apollo 8, Houston. It looks like it may take
 another 6 hours on this battery B charge. It turns
 out that the charge rate is less than what we are
 getting on our ground curves, but it is still
 above the Apollo 7 curves, and it looks like it
 is going along now in good shape. And I would
 like to have verification that the timeline
 leading up to the midcourse correction was satisfactory
 from your point of view.
00 13 38 57 LMP Roger. Seemed quite satisfactory.
00 13 38 59 CC Okay. Thank you. And we will stay off the loop
 until you give us a call.
00 13 39 04 LMP Roger. You don't bother us, but our replies make
 a lot of noise.
00 13 39 13 CC Okay.

Tape 12
Page 1
00 14 43 00 LMP Houston. Apollo 8. How do you read?
00 14 43 14 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
00 14 43 26 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You're very weak. You got
 the proper OMNI?
00 14 44 02 LMP Houston. Apollo. How do you read?
00 14 44 04 CC Loud and clear, Bill. Go ahead.
00 14 44 06 LMP Okay. I'm just wondering how your tracking's
 doing.
00 14 44 14 CC Okay. We're still tracking you. We don't have
 any firm solutions, yet.
00 14 44 29 LMP Okay. Things looking nominal up here. How
 about down there?
00 14 44 33 CC Okay. The systems basically look good, Bill.
 We're going to be coming up on a cryo fan cycle
 period in another few minutes, and you can go
 ahead and do that when you get ready.
00 14 44 46 LMP Okay.
00 14 44 51 CC And I guess we picked up some suspicions about
 the fuel cell 2 radiator out temp. How does
 that compare on board?
00 14 47 56 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 14 48 09 CC Apollo 8, you called?
00 14 48 13 LMP We're showing RAD OUT temp on fuel cell 2
 would be about 90 degrees, and on 1 and 3 it would
 be slightly lower - maybe 75 or 80 degrees.
 About an hour ago you wondered about fuel cells
 performance; it looks like 1 and 2 are lower in
 performance than 3. Over.

Tape 12
Page 2
00 14 48 45 CC Roger. We show the same numbers on your outlet
 temperatures and thought that was a sensor failure.
 We've been watching the thing and we'll
 keep you advised of anything we see.
00 14 49 01 LMP Okay.
00 14 49 11 CC And on the performance, you're right - they are
 not quite the same, 1 and 2 are a little bit
 lower but all of these are sitting within the ballpark.
00 14 49 24 LMP Roger. Fuel cell 1 has shown slightly a proportionately
 higher H<sub>2</sub> flow than O<sub>2</sub> flow all day long.
00 14 49 35 CC Okay.
00 14 49 41 LMP I'm showing 0.062 H<sub>2</sub> and 0.48 O<sub>2</sub>.
00 14 49 53 CC Roger. We'll take some CAL curves on those.
00 14 50 23 CC Okay. These things look reasonable to me and
 we'll keep looking at them. Our RAD OUT shows
 about 0.43 as opposed to your 0.48 on the oxygen,
 and we'll keep an eye on the CAL curves and just
 sort of watch it for you.
00 14 50 39 LMP Okay. Thank you.
00 14 50 46 CC If you'd like to set up some kind of a COMM check
 or specified time like every 30 minutes or so on
 these quiet periods, that would be okay with us.
 Might help to let us know that we're still in
 business.
00 14 51 03 LMP All right. Just give me a call every now and then.
00 14 51 06 CC Okay.

00 15 03 30 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Sometime when it's convenient,
 get your BIOMED switch over to the right, and
 you don't need to answer; just pass it up
 to you.

00 16 00 27 CC Apollo 8, Houston. How about a COMM check, and
 did you get that fuel cell purge - correction,
 the cryo fans ON?
00 16 00 37 LMP Roger. We've had the cryo fans ON each for
 about 3 or 4 minutes.
00 16 00 41 CC Okay. Real good. We weren't real sure that's
 what we were watching, and you're coming through
 loud and clear.
00 16 00 48 CMP Roger.
00 16 14 06 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 16 14 08 CMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
00 16 14 13 CC Okay, Jim. Got an update here to the flight plan.
 You've got the 16:55 star visibility check, and
 what we've got on that looks like Navi is still
 our star, and the numbers associated with that are
 roll 102.6, pitch 328.9, yaw 346.3. That gives
 you a shaft and trunnion of zero. And if you
 think you can - if you think you can do something
 with this, why we would like to go ahead and give
 it a try and see if we can either verify it or
 maybe we'll both learn something if we verify it
 if you can do it with Navi.
00 16 15 03 CMP Roger. Standby one.
00 16 19 52 CMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
00 16 19 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

Tape 13
Page 2
00 16 20 04 CMP Roger. We'll maneuver at this present time and
 try to pick up that attitude and get Navi, although
 I think it's a waste of time, but we will give it
 a try.
00 16 20 13 CC Roger. Standing by for results.
00 16 38 10 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 16 38 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
00 16 38 17 CMP Roger. We're at that attitude right now and
 looking through the scanning telescope. I can
 barely see any stars at all, and every time that
 the thruster will fire, you know, just completely
 blanks out my vision.
00 16 38 35 CC Roger, 8. Understand.
00 16 38 43 CMP Now the attitude is good, Houston, as far as
 not having glare on the optics, and it might be
 a certain amount of data adaptation is required
 here.
00 16 39 01 CC 8, Houston. Roger. Copy.
00 17 08 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 17 09 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
00 17 10 29 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
00 17 13 33 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
00 17 13 36 CMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
00 17 13 41 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. I've got a new PTC
 attitude for you when you finish P23. Give you
 a better look at the earth. Over.

Tape 13
Page 3
00 17 13 53 CMP Roger. Ready to copy.
00 17 13 55 CC Okay. Pitch 224, yaw 20.
00 17 14 09 CMP New PTC is pitch 224, yaw 20.
00 17 14 13 CC Affirm.
00 17 15 53 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 17 15 55 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
00 17 16 28 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
00 17 16 42 CC Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
00 17 16 58 CC Apollo 8, Apollo 8,Houston. Go ahead.
00 17 17 04 CMP Roger. We are taking our time going to this
 new P23 attitude; going to Navi is quite a ways
 away from the attitude we need for P23. I have a
 correction to make on 20 - on Navi after getting
 dark adapted; you can pick out Cassiopeia and
 you can pick out Navi itself. It is difficult
 to see what stars are around. We still have
 quite a bit of particles that are floating with
 the spacecraft, especially when we move the optics
 and shaft. It seems to throw off a lot of particles.
00 17 17 43 CC Roger. We copy that. What's your spacecraft
 lighting situation inside now?
00 17 17 53 CMP We have the center window - the round window
 covered, and we have - the other windows are
 opened.
00 17 18 04 CC Roger, 8. Copy.

00 17 24 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 17 24 17 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
00 17 24 19 CC Apollo 8, Houston. While you're maneuvering for
 your P23, we have an update for DELTA-H for you
 if you're ready to copy.
00 17 24 28 CMP Roger. Stand by.
00 17 25 04 CMP Roger, Houston. You say you have a DELTA-H update
 for us? Just what do you mean?
00 17 25 08 CC Roger. DELTA horizon update.
00 17 25 14 CMP Roger. Go ahead.
00 17 25 16 CC This is as a result of your P23 calibration; the
 update follow: VERB 24, NOUN 01, ENTER 1354,
 ENTER all balls, ENTER 21450 ENTER; comment:
 continue to mark on the horizon destination that
 you've used previously. Your marks are looking
 very good.
00 17 25 57 CMP Roger. DELTA-H update as follows: VERB 24,
 NOUN 01, ENTER 1354. ENTER all zeros. ENTER 21450
 ENTER. Understand those are two octal numbers.
00 17 26 18 CC That's affirmative; both octal.
00 17 26 25 LMP Roger. When do we get the maneuvers here? I'll
 go out on 23, and I'll put these in; then I'll continue.
00 17 26 31 CC Okay.
00 17 27 19 CC Apollo 8, Houston. There's no requirement for
 you to leave P23; you can enter those right now
 if you want to.

00 17 27 30 CMP Roger.
00 17 49 25 LMP Houston, are we in low bit rate now?
00 17 49 33 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You're in high bit rate.
00 17 49 38 LMP Roger. We'd like to record you this P23 stuff.
00 17 49 43 CC Okay.
00 17 49 49 LMP How about commanding low bit rate record FORWARD.
00 17 49 53 CC Roger. Low bit rate, record FORWARD.
00 17 50 25 LMP All right, Houston. Have you sent those commands
 yet?
00 17 50 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston. They have been sent.
00 17 50 32 LMP All right, Roger. Thank you. I am on the other
 side, too lazy to go over and get it.
00 17 52 09 CC Apollo 8, Houston, We'd like to go back to high
 bit rate in order to get this P23 data recorded.
 Over.
00 17 52 36 LMP Our checklist says low bit rate, Houston. If you
 want high, you can have it.
00 17 52 40 CC Roger. We're going high bit rate.
00 17 52 46 LMP Okay.
00 18 09 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 18 09 20 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
00 18 09 22 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Do you want us to turn off
 your DSE for you? It's probably about half full.
 We're getting good high bit rate down.
00 18 09 31 CDR Do you want to get the rest of this data?
00 18 09 34 CC We're getting good high bit rate down.

Tape 14
Page 3
00 18 09 39 CDR Roger. Go ahead.
00 18 09 41 CC Okay. And, also, we're - your state vector is
 now based on shout 5 hours of tracking. We
 have you on a pericynthian of 69.7 miles with a
 free return. Your entry flight path angle looks
 like about minus 14. You will need only a few
 feet per second to get you back on a nominal entry
 angle.
00 18 10 43 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Did you get the words on
 the state vector?
00 18 11 14 CDR Houston, did you read? Apollo 8. We got a lot
 of noise.
00 18 11 20 CC Apollo8, Houston. Go ahead.
00 18 11 40 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 18 11 43 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
00 18 11 54 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston reading you fairly weak.
 I'll repeat the state vector information. Your
 state vector is now based on 5 hours, more than
 5 hours of tracking. We show you on a pericynthian
 of 69.7 miles with a free return with entry
 path flight angle of minus 14 degrees. Will
 only need a few feet per second at the lunar distance
 to get you back on a nominal entry angle.
 Over.

 clear.
00 18 22 22 CDR Roger. Our sighting schedule is complete, and
 I'm maneuvering to PTC attitude.
00 18 22 28 CC Roger. Copy.
00 18 42 03 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
00 18 42 05 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
00 18 42 09 CDR Roger. I'm at the PTC maneuver now. Like a
 distance status from you - how the battery looks
 and how the fuel cells look and et cetera. Over.
00 18 42 23 CC Roger.
00 18 43 21 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 18 43 24 LMP Go ahead.
00 18 43 26 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. We figure battery B
 will be charged in about 2 to 3 hours. All your
 systems look GO; your RCS usage so far is about
 60 pounds, six-zero pounds over nominal. Over.
00 18 43 45 LMP Roger. How about fuel cell 2; is that looking
 all right now?
00 18 43 50 CC Roger. Fuel cells are all looking good.
00 18 43 54 LMP Okay. We're going to have two of us hit the hay
 now and one man minding the store so you might
 have everybody keep an extra sharp eye on ...
00 18 44 09 CC Roger, Bill. You think you're going to be able
 to sleep okay?

Tape 14
Page 5
00 18 44 12 LMP Yes. I think we kinda warmed up to a good
 sleep here by now.
00 18 44 20 CMP Houston. Apollo 8.
00 18 44 22 CC Go ahead.
00 18 44 24 CMP Onboard navigation indicates a pericynthian altitude
 of 38.4 miles.
00 18 44 32 CC Understand; 38.4 miles.
00 18 44 38 CMP That's affirmative. It's on the DSKY right now,
 if you're reading it.
00 18 44 42 CC Roger. Copy.
00 18 47 37 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 18 47 42 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
00 18 47 43 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Be advised your downlink
 now is getting very noisy.
00 18 49 52 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston with some comments on
 navigation.
00 18 49 59 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
00 18 50 02 CC Good morning, Frank. Apollo 8, this is Houston.
 We're wondering about your GDC backup align;
 we'd like your opinion on the possibility of
 doing this align using Sirius and Rigel rather
 than Navi, as it's in the north set at this time.
 Over.
00 18 50 31 CMP Stand by one.
00 18 50 33 CC Roger.

Tape 14
Page 6
00 18 51 06 CMP Houston, this is Apollo 8. We concur. Sirius
 and Rigel would be two stars that would be much
 better than Navi and Polaris. However, I did
 Cassiopeia after I became adapted, but I'm
 afraid that the time required to do that type
 of alignment would be extensive if we ever had
 to go to that alignment.
00 18 51 33 CC Roger, Jim. We understand. We'll go ahead and
 work in that direction, and we'll quit bothering
 you. Good night.
00 18 53 02 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston.
00 18 53 07 CMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 18 53 10 CC Apollo 8, Houston. At 19 GET, we're due for
 another cycle through on the cryo fans. Over.

 behind on water and food, and we don't seem to
 have too much of an appetite. We're trying to
 stay up with the water, but the food is - not
 that there's anything wrong with the food, but
 we're just not very hungry.
00 19 33 25 CC Roger. Understand, Frank.
00 19 33 29 CDR The CDR got 5 hours of fitful sleep and rest,

00 20 57 54 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. At 21 hours,
 we'd like you to terminate the battery B
 charge and start battery A charge and then
 begin an O<sub>2</sub> purge. Over.
00 20 58 10 CDR Roger. Understand; terminate battery 8, start
 battery A, and an O<sub>2</sub> purge.
00 20 58 13 CC Roger. O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge.
00 20 58 17 CDR Thank you.
00 21 00 47 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. We are now charging
 battery A, and say again about the purge.
00 21 01 03 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Copy your battery
 charge setup; now begin a fuel cell O<sub>2</sub> purge.
 Over.
00 21 01 13 CDR Fuel cell O<sub>2</sub> purge. Roger.
00 21 09 09 CDR Houston, the fuel cells are all purged.

00 21 09 27 CDR How's the tracking going, Jerry?
00 21 10 23 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 21 10 28 CC Apollo 8. Houston.
00 21 10 31 CDR How's the tracking looking?
00 21 10 33 CC It's looking good, Frank. We just took in
 another batch of data, and we are processing
 it. It looks initially like we won't even
 need a midcourse number 2. As soon as we

Tape 16
Page 2
 process this data, we will have some confirmation
 for you. It should take anywhere from
 15 to 30 minutes to finish the job.
00 21 10 53 CDR Thank you.
00 21 13 39 CC Apollo 8. Houston.
00 21 13 43 CDR Go ahead.
00 21 13 45 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are showing your
 pericynthian 64 nautical miles. Your next midcourse
 at 28 will be less than 1 foot per second.
 We will have a firm confirmation on this in about
 2 hours.

00 21 41 24 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 21 41 26 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
00 21 41 29 CDR How do you read?
00 21 41 31 CC Reading you loud and clear, Frank. Good morning.
 How are you doing?
00 21 41 34 CDR Just fine. We just broke lock for a minute,
 and I wondered why.
00 21 41 38 CC Roger.
00 21 43 14 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 21 43 17 CDR Go ahead.
00 21 43 20 CC Roger. Your break lock is due to the fact we
 switched our antennas over from Honeysuckle to
 Madrid. Over.
00 21 43 28 CDR Roger. Thank you.
00 23 11 48 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
00 23 11 53 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 23 11 55 CC Roger, Frank. We would like to bring you up
 to date on your trajectory. This midcourse
 coming up at 28 hours GET turns out to be very
 small, 0.7 feet per second, and we would like
 not to do it. Our data is looking extremely
 good and extrapolating it forward; it shows
 the midcourse number 4 at LOI minus 8 hours
 would be about 4 feet per second. In the
 meantime, the free return trajectory is looking
 very good with a water splash point off the

Tape 17
Page 2
 coast of Africa. So it looks like you are
 right down the old center line, and we propose
 not to do the next midcourse. Over.
00 23 12 37 CDR Fine with us.
00 23 12 40 CC Okay. And in regard to your timeline here, we
 suggest that you let Bill and Jim sleep for an
 extra period of time and don't wake them up
 until 26:30 GET, and that would cause deletion
 of P52 and P23 at 26 hours GET. Over.
00 23 13 08 CDR Roger. Understand. Delete P52 and P23.
00 23 13 12 CC Affirmative. Delete those at 26 hours, wake
 the other two guys up at 26:30 at which time
 they can eat, and then chlorinate the water
 supply after they have eaten.
00 23 13 29 CDR Roger.
00 23 13 30 CC That would put us back on our nominal flight
 plan at 28 hours GET. Over.
00 23 13 38 CDR Roger.
00 23 13 43 CC How's all that grab you?
00 23 13 47 CDR Fine.
00 23 13 50 CC Okay.
00 23 38 39 CC Apollo 8, Houston, Over.
00 23 38 43 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
00 23 38 45 CC Roger, we're switching antennas again at
 23:40 GET. You can expect a momentary break
 lock, and also we would like to bring you up
 to date on the passive thermal control. We


Tape 17
Page 3
 expect to keep the same PTC attitude until
 28 hours GET. Over.
00 23 39 05 CDR Fine; thank you. How is the thermal control
 working?
00 23 39 10 CC Working good, Frank. I can give you some details
 if you want it.
00 23 39 18 CDR Go ahead.
00 23 39 39 CDR I am all ears, Houston. Go ahead with the
 details.
00 23 39 42 CC Okay. Stand by one until we switch our antennas,
 Frank. We'll be right with you.
00 23 39 50 CDR Roger.
00 23 40 41 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
00 23 40 43 CDR Go ahead.
00 23 40 45 CC On your PTC, quads A, C, and D seem to be just
 about identical. Quad B is running slightly
 cooler, but only very slightly so. The temperature
 readouts in all respects are normal,
 so apparently the PTC is working well from a
 thermal viewpoint. And as far as the fuel consumption
 goes, it's minimal, just about like we
 expected. Have you got any comments about PTC?
 How does it seem to you?
00 23 41 13 CDR Seems fine. Seems to be working all right, just
 like you said. I was just wondering how the
 readouts from the SPS were, too.

Tape 17
Page 4
00 23 41 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston. The SPS temperature is
 normal. If anything, it's slightly warmer
 than we expected, so you are in real good
 shape in that respect.
00 23 41 59 CDR Thank you.
00 23 42 19 CC Frank, the PU valve temperature is running
 about 72 degrees, which is better control than
 we got here in this room.
00 23 42 29 CDR Roger.

 on all four fans, a short burst from each of them
 as you did before.
00 23 47 37 CDR Understand, 2 minutes each on all cryo fans.
00 23 47 39 CC Roger.
00 23 55 12 CDR Cryo fans OFF and cycled, Houston.
00 23 55 24 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead. Over.
00 23 55 29 CDR I said the cryo fans are OFF and completed the

01 00 43 03 CDR How've you been reading our tape dumps?
01 00 43 06 CC Stand by one, Frank. We noticed that you've
 got your PTC attitude peaked up a bit, and I'll
 check on your tape dump.

Tape 18
Page 2
01 00 43 41 CC Apollo 8, Houston. The quality of the tape dump
 has been very good. We have about 15 minutes to
 dump, which we will do the next time we get high
 gain. Over.
01 00 43 52 CDR How's the voice quality been?
01 00 43 56 CC It's been very good, Frank.
01 00 44 00 CDR Okay. We'll send you something down here shortly.
01 00 47 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
01 00 47 18 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
01 00 47 21 CC Frank, on this tape recorder, we have the tape
 motion stopped right now. If you would like to
 record some, we will give you the tape in motion
 so that you may do so. Is that what you would
 like? Over.
01 00 47 31 CDR Roger. Houston, why don't you just give us salvo
 so we can control the switches here.
01 00 47 40 CC Okay. Stand by.
01 00 47 41 CDR ... PCM LOW and stop.
01 00 47 53 CC You should have it now. Over.
01 00 47 59 CDR Roger.
01 00 53 52 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 00 53 59 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
01 00 54 02 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
01 00 54 05 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
01 00 54 09 LMP Roger. Are you capable of taking a high-bit FM
 dump for voice on the OMNI's?

Tape 18
Page 3
01 00 54 19 CC That is negative, Bill. Not quite, on the OMNI's.
01 00 54 26 LMP Okay. We will catch you next time around then.
01 00 54 29 CC Roger. Thank you.
01 00 54 32 CMP Good morning, Mike. How are things going down
 there?
01 00 54 35 CC Hi, Jim. Things are going real fine. How are
 you doing up there? Did you get a good night's
 sleep?
01 00 54 41 CMP Oh, you know. The first night in space all the
 time; it's a little slow.
01 00 54 46 CC The old man woke you up earlier than he needed to.
01 00 54 51 CMP Well, we just couldn't sleep any longer.
01 00 54 55 CC Roger. Understand.
01 00 55 01 CC Apollo 8, Houston. The next time you are locked
 up on the high gain, give us a call, and we will
 configure for a dump. Over.
01 00 55 16 LMP Roger. We would like an evaluation of the voice
 comments. Over.
01 00 55 21 CC Roger. Understand. So far, it's been very good.
 We will evaluate this one as soon as we can.
01 00 55 44 LMP How are the systems looking down there, Houston?
01 00 55 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
01 00 55 53 LMP Roger. I've been in the sack. How do the systems
 look?
01 00 55 56 CC Everything is looking real good, Bill.
01 00 56 00 LMP Okay. How much longer do you expect on charging
 battery A?

Tape 18
Page 4
01 00 56 11 CC Stand by, Bill. We will get you an exact number
 on it.
01 00 56 16 LMP Just a rough estimate. And also, have you seen
 any more hints on that sensor problem on fuel
 cell 2?
01 00 56 28 CC Stand by one. I'll get the latest scoop on it
 for you, Bill.
01 00 56 56 CC Bill, there is nothing new on fuel cell number 2.
 We don't think there is anything at all wrong
 with the fuel cell. It's some sort of a sensor
 problem, but we don't have any new information
 on it.
01 00 57 06 LMP Okay. They all look pretty good from here, Mike.
01 00 57 11 CC Roger. Thank you.
01 00 57 18 CC I've got some updates for you whenever you are
 ready to copy.
01 00 57 24 LMP Stand by.
01 00 57 26 CC Okay.
01 00 57 31 LMP What kind?
01 00 57 33 CC Well, I've got a TLI plus 35 hour update, and
 then I have an update to Jim's checklist.
01 00 57 49 LMP Let's have the TLI plus 30 before we get the
 checklist update.
01 00 57 54 CMP They never give up on the checklist, do they?
01 00 57 57 CC Okay. This - when you get your maneuver PAD
 book out - the last maneuver PAD we gave you

Tape 18
Page 5
 for the flyby PAD still remains valid. We would
 just like to remark that the entry angle, the
 Gamma, is slightly steeper than we consider
 ideal, but it's within our - sort of the noise
 level of our ability to predict at this time.
 So that flyby maneuver PAD remains valid. Over.
01 00 58 28 CMP Roger, Houston.
01 00 58 30 CC Okay. Now on that page with the flyby maneuver,
 under your north set of stars, I have some new
 numbers for you because we've changed those stars
 from Navi and Polaris. As you recall, we changed
 to Sirius and Rigel, so - And that also, by the
 way, is the checklist update which I will give
 you later - but on that maneuver PAD, I have got
 three new angles for you using Sirius and Rigel
 when you are ready to copy those.
01 00 59 56 CC Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.
01 01 01 01 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
01 01 01 21 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
01 01 01 23 CC Roger, Apollo 8. Houston. You are loud and
 clear now. We had a lot of background noise
 there for a few minutes. How are you reading
 me?
01 01 01 31 LMP Roger. I'm reading you okay, Mike, and I read
 you the last time you asked me that, so I guess
 maybe I wasn't getting through to you.

Tape 18
Page 6
01 01 01 39 CC Okay. Well, did you copy on this flyby maneuver
 PAD? We've got three new angles. Are you ready
 to copy those?
01 01 01 47 LMP I'm ready to copy the flyby angles.
01 01 01 49 CC Okay. Roll 137. pitch 310, yaw 340. Over.
01 01 02 05 LMP Roger. Roll 137, pitch 310, yaw 340.
01 01 02 11 CC That's affirmative, and I have the TLI plus
 35 hour PAD when you are ready for it.
01 01 02 19 LMP Roger. Ready for the TLI plus 35.
01 01 02 23 CC Roger. TLI plus 35 hours, SPS/G&N, 63023 minus
 162 plus 129. Are you with me so far?
01 01 02 46 LMP Loud and clear.
01 01 02 49 CC Good. 037 56 5138, plus 00068, plus 00000, plus
 46420 178 134 001, not applicable, plus 00202
 46420 547 46211. Are you with me? Over.
01 01 04 01 LMP Roger. Loud and clear.
01 01 04 03 CC Good. 12 1383 327 023 up 172 left 22, plus 1293,
 minus 16500, 12905 36180 074:11:16. Comments:
 on your stars Sirius and Rigel, roll 010,
 pitch 294, yaw 320, no ullage. Other: one,
 fast return P37, DELTA-V equals 7821, for mid-Pacific
 landing for MTL; two, high speed procedures
 not required. Over.
01 01 05 58 LMP Roger. Are you ready for the readback?
01 01 06 01 CC All set.

Tape 18

01 01 06 04 LMP TLI plus 35, SPS/G&N 63023, minus 162, plus 129
 037 56 5138, plus 00068, plus 00000, plus 46420
 178 134 000, NA. Are you with me?
01 01 06 35 CC Yes, I'm with you, Bill. That last one should
 be 001.
01 01 06 42 LMP Roger. Y 001, NA, plus 00202 46420 547 46211 12

 Rigel: 010 294 320, no ullage, fast return P37,
 7821 mid-PAC; high speed not required. Over.
01 01 07 44 CC That's about the size of it. You're getting
 pretty good at this thing, Bill, for a rookie.
01 01 07 51 LMP Not bad. I just learned to read about a year
01 01 07 55 CC Roger. Hey, I've got a flight plan update for
 Jim. It's on page G, George, 82 Able of his
 checklist. Over.
01 01 08 06 CMP Roger. I've got it open. Go ahead, Mike.
01 01 08 08 CC Okay. It's simply changing these north set of
 stars around. For Navi substitute Sirius, which
 is number 15, and for Rigel - correction - for
 Polaris substitute Rigel, number 12.
01 01 08 31 CMP Roger. Substitute Rigel for Polaris and Sirius
 for Navi. How about shaft and trunnion; remain
 the same?

Tape 18
Page 8
01 01 08 38 CC Your shaft and trunnions remain the same. Sirius
 remains on the 50-degree line just like Navi used
 to be. Rigel is down 1.3 degrees from your horizontal,
 from your M-line. Over.
01 01 08 56 CMP Roger. Understand.
01 01 08 59 CC Okay. And let me know when it gets to be breakfast
 time. I've got a newspaper to read up to
 you and a few other things.
01 01 09 06 LMP We're ready.
01 01 09 11 CC Okay. I've got a Haney special here for you.
 The Interstellar Times latest edition says the
 flight to the man is occupying prime space on
 both paper and television; it's THE news story.
 The headlines of the Post says "Moon, here they
 come. We understand that Bill Anders will be
 in private conversation or communication today
 with an old man who wears a red suit and lives
 at the North Pole. A suspect in the Miami kidnapping
 was captured late yesterday, and the
 11 GI's that have been detained 5 months in
 Cambodia were released yesterday and will make
 it home in time for Christmas.
01 01 09 57 LMP Roger. With reference to the first, we saw
 him earlier this morning, and he was heading
 your way.

Tape 18
Page 9
01 01 10 03 CC Roger. We'll pass the word along. David
 Eisenhower and Julie Nixon were married yesterday
 in New York. He was described as "nervous".
01 01 10 15 LMP Right.
01 01 10 18 CC The Browns took Dallas apart yesterday 31 to 20.
 We're sort of curious, who do you like today,
 Baltimore or Minnesota? Over.
01 01 10 29 CMP Baltimore.
01 01 10 31 CC How many points are you giving?
01 01 10 34 LMP (Laughter) He's not making many points at home
 with that comment.
01 01 10 40 CC Roger. Understand. Oh, I've got another score
 for you when you are ready to copy. Are you
 ready to copy?
01 01 10 51 LMP Stand by. Go ahead.
01 01 11 06 CC Roger. Navy 14, Army 21. Would you like for me
 to repeat that? Over.
01 01 11 14 LMP You are very garbled; Houston; I'm unable to
 read. Will call you back in another year.
01 01 11 21 CC Okay. We also notice the University of Houston
 lost their first home basketball game in
 3-1/2 years last night. Illinois edged them
 out 97 to 84. And some really big news: the
 State Department announced only a few minutes
 ago that the Pueblo crew will be released at
 9 p.m. tonight.

Tape 18
Page 10
01 01 11 48 CMP Sounds good. Outboard calculations indicate
 that Apollo 8 at 25 hours is 104 000 miles from
 home.
01 01 12 00 CC Yes. Our plot board shows a similar number.
01 01 12 07 CDR Mighty nice view from here.
01 01 12 12 CC We're showing about 104 800 miles, and we're
 guessing another 8 to 10 hours on your battery
 charge.
01 01 12 23 LMP Okay.
01 01 12 35 CC Frank, say again about the view. You were
 blocked, I think.
01 01 12 41 CDR This is a mighty nice view we have down there
 today. A little bit more than a half earth.
 Looks like Africa and the Red Sea is visible;
 we're not quite sure as there is quite a bit
 of cloud cover; but even through the hazy windows, it's mighty nice.
01 01 12 58 CC How are your windows? Do you have a couple left
 that are real clear?
01 01 13 02 CDR The rendezvous windows are good. The others
 are all about the same as they were when we last
 reported. One and five have a slight haze and
 a little fog on the inside.
01 01 13 16 CC Roger. Understand.
01 01 16 55 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
01 01 16 59 CMP ...

Tape 18
Page 11
01 01 17 01 CC Roger. Just as a matter of curiosity for Bill,
 we can say a few words about the heaters for the
 cryo tanks, and also for the fans. We've noticed
 that the heaters are doing their thing normally,
 cycling on and off; and as time goes by, this
 cycle rate increases, indicating a little bit of
 stratification in the tanks. And then when we've
 been turning the fans on every 4 hours for a couple
 of minutes, this stirs things up and the
 heaters then cycling on and off again more
 slowly for awhile, until again a little bit of
 stratification occurs, and the cycling becomes
 slightly more rapid. This is, of course, normal;
 we just point it out as a curiosity to you. Over.
01 01 17 45 LMP Roger. I haven't really been following it that
 close. One thing I have noticed is when you
 turn the fans on you get a glitch in the quantity,
 which might correspond to a glitch in AC.
 Maybe the next time we'll look at the AC volts
 and see what happens.
01 01 18 14 CC Our experts say that's not the reason for the
 glitch. They say the stratification fakes out
 the capacitance sensor there for a second.
01 01 18 25 LMP I knew they would have some big deal answer
 for me.
01 01 18 31 CC ... got you today.

Tape 18
Page 12
01 01 18 32 LMP I'll buy that.
01 01 18 33 CMP Roger.
01 01 18 36 CC Any other information you want us to send up
 to you?
01 01 18 43 LMP No, we're going to zap you with the high gain
 here shortly.
01 01 18 46 CC Okay.
END OF TAPE

Tape 19
Page 1
01 01 19 36 LMP Houston, this is Apollo 8. How do you read on
 the high gain?
01 01 19 39 CC Reading you loud and clear, Bill. How me?
01 01 19 44 LMP I'm reading you loud and clear. I'll go ahead
 and dump this. You might want to listen to it
 in real time to evaluate the voice.
01 01 19 54 CC Okay. We'll do that as soon as we can.
01 01 19 57 LMP Give me a call when you are ready.
01 01 20 08 CC Do you want to dump it by your command, or would
 you like us to command the dump on it? Over.
01 01 20 15 LMP Oh, you can go ahead and command whenever you
 are ready.
01 01 20 18 CC Okay. we are starting now; thank you.
01 01 20 19 LMP I've already rewound.
01 01 20 20 CC Roger.
01 01 20 21 LMP Roger. I've already rewound.
01 01 21 02 LMP There is only about 5 minutes worth on the tape,
 Houston.
01 01 21 07 CC Roger. Understand, Bill. You promised me you
 would wait 3 days before you started doing this,
 Bill.
01 01 21 31 LMP It has been a long trip.
01 01 26 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 01 26 52 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
01 01 26 53 CC Roger, Bill. We've got your dump, and the voice
 quality is very good. We we going to take about

Tape 19
Page 2
 20 minutes or so to get it back to Houston to
 play it.
01 01 27 11 LMP Roger. Where are you taking it through, Houston?
01 01 27 15 CC It comes through Madrid and then Ascension, Bill.
01 01 27 21 LMP Okay.
01 01 40 56 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 01 41 13 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
01 01 41 30 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
01 01 42 41 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
01 01 42 55 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
01 01 43 27 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
01 01 43 30 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
01 01 43 32 CC Roger, Bill. We are reading you loud and clear
 now. We had an antenna problem down here. We
 had an unexpected switch of antenna, which probably
 caused your high gain to quit.
01 01 43 47 LMP Roger.
01 01 45 02 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
01 01 45 16 LMP Go ahead,Houston. Apollo 8.
01 01 45 18 CC Roger, Jim. When we lost our antenna down here,
 we interrupted your tape dump, so we are in the
 process of doing some rewinding and continuing
 the dump, in case Bill is wondering what is going
 on with the tape recorder.
01 01 45 33 CMP Okay. No strain.
01 01 56 53 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

Tape 19
Page 3
01 01 56 56 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
01 01 56 58 CC Roger. At 26 hours GET, we'll be switching our
 antennas back again at Madrid, and you can expect
 a glitch on your COMM system.
01 01 57 12 LMP Roger.
01 01 57 17 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 01 57 18 CC Go ahead, Jim.
01 01 57 21 CMP I noticed that you skipped the IMU alignment for
 about 26 hours because we were still asleep. Do
 you want to include that again, or do you think
 it is required?
01 01 57 33 CC Roger, Jim. We think it is going to be required
 prior to the next set of P23 sightings, and we're
 suggesting that it be put in at 27:45. We'll
 have a flight plan - a more complete flight plan
 update in here shortly.
01 01 57 51 CMP Okay. Fine. We're in the process of having
 breakfast.
01 01 57 57 CC Roger. Understand.
01 02 04 06 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 02 04 11 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
01 02 04 12 CC The tape dumps are complete; it's rewound. You
 can go ahead and record in low bit rate if you ...
01 02 04 20 CMP Roger. Will do.
01 02 41 22 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 02 41 27 LMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.

Tape 19
Page 4
01 02 41 28 CC Disregard. We were going to talk about the
 high gain, but you beat us to it.
01 02 41 35 LMP Okay.
01 02 42 47 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 02 42 50 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
01 02 42 52 CC Roger, Jim. We would like to take control of
 the tape for a few minutes to make sure that we
 got all that last dump. Over.
01 02 43 00 CMP Okay. Stand by one.
01 02 43 02 CC Roger.
01 02 43 03 CMP You've got it.
01 02 43 04 CC Thank you, sir.
01 02 44 14 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 02 44 16 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
01 02 44 22 LMP Roger. I just noticed that I can hear those
 RTC's coming through on normal voice.
01 02 44 44 CC What does it sound like, Bill?
01 02 44 58 LMP A little squeak.
01 02 46 34 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
01 02 46 39 LMP Go ahead.
01 02 46 41 CC Roger. I have a flight plan update for you
 sometime at your convenience.
01 02 46 47 LMP Alright.
01 02 47 50 LMP Ready to copy.
01 02 47 53 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Were you calling? Over.
01 02 47 56 LMP Roger. Ready to copy.

Tape 19
Page 5
01 02 47 58 CC Okay, Bill. This will be on page 2 dash 22 of
 your flight plan.  For the command module pilot -
 I've already mentioned it to him - but at the
 top of the page, at about 27:45, actually, we
 would like him to do a P52, an IMU alignment,
 and then the P23 should be done as scheduled.
 Those four stars, Procyon, Regulus, Alphard, and
 Spica: we realize Alphard may not be too good
 a star, Regulus is about 3 degrees above the
 horizon, and Spica is at a 48-degree trunnion
 angle; so I guess what we are saying is if Jim
 has difficulty doing one set on each of those
 four stars, we suggest that he omit whichever
 one he is having difficulty with and pick it up
 by doing two sets on some other star that he
 likes. Over.
01 02 49 09 LMP Roger. Understand.
01 02 49 10 CC All right. In the lower right hand corner of
 page 2-22, the passive thermal control attitude
 should read "pitch 224 degrees, yaw 020."
01 02 49 29 LMP Roger. Copy.
01 02 49 31 CC And on the next page, at about 29 hours, you
 can resume the normal flight plan. We would
 like to make one addition; at 29:30, add a
 waste water dump. Even though one is not really
 required at that time, we would like to get the

Tape 19
Page 6
 dump out of the way so we can track you uninterruptedly
 without any dumping, you know, as
 we are coming up on midcourse correction number
 3. Over.
01 02 50 03 LMP Roger.
01 02 50 06 CC That's about all, Bill. You got any questions
 on this?
01 02 50 11 LMP No, it looks pretty good. We've been saving up
 some water of our own to dump here, so that will
 work out all right.
01 02 50 18 CC Very good. And don't ruin Jim's optics.
01 02 50 24 LMP Right.
01 02 50 48 CC Apollo8, Houston.
01 02 50 51 LMP Go.
01 02 50 52 CC Roger. We would like P00 in ACCEPT, please. We
 would like to send you up a P27. It's a LM state
 vector, going into the LM slot only, and we do
 not want you to transfer it over to the CSM.
01 02 51 24 CC Apollo 8. Houston. Did you copy?
01 02 51 28 LMP Roger. You got it.
01 02 51 34 CC Okay. We got it. We're sending you a LM state
 vector, and we would like you not to transfer
 that vector over to the CSM slot.
01 02 51 40 LMP Roger.
01 02 51 42 CC Thank you.

01 02 55 40 LMP Apollo 8. Roger. Are you still planning an
 MCC 2 at 28 hours? Over.
01 02 55 48 CC Stand by one, Bill. Bill, negative. Now that
 midcourse correction number 2 has been cancelled.
 Its magnitude was less than 1 foot per second,
 so we decided not to do it. Over.
01 02 56 12 LMP Okay. Thank you.
01 02 56 14 CC And you've got the computer again, if you go
 to BLOCK.
01 02 56 22 LMP Okay.
01 02 58 29 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 02 58 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
01 02 58 36 LMP Are you still computing the pericynthian time
 of 69:10.
01 02 58 45 CC Stand by. We will get an update for you.
01 02 58 48 LMP Okay.
01 02 59 40 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Your 69:10 pericynthian is
 still good plus or minus a minute, and we will
 get it down to a fine map measurement ...
01 03 26 08 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 03 26 15 LMP Roger. This is Apollo 8.
01 03 26 17 CC Okay, Bill. We just got your readout on your
 voice tape, and we will be back with you on
 it shortly. Over.
01 03 26 27 LMP Okay.

Tape 20
Page 2
01 03 26 30 CMP Houston, I'm going to be doing my alignment at
 this time. I'm in a good position for viewing

 or so ago, (i.e., pitch 224, yaw 020) is a
 good one.
01 05 07 43 LMP 224 20. Roger.
01 05 07 46 CC Roger.

01 05 40 56 CDR Fine. What is the news?
01 05 41 01 CC Well, did you get the intergalactic news summary
 we sent up to you a couple of hours ago?
 It might have been during your rest period. We
 gave you a couple of football scores. One of
 them in particular was - I don't know if you
 copied that - Army 21, Navy 14. Over.
01 05 41 21 CDR One, two, three, four, five, six, seven; testing
 out.
01 05 41 24 CMP I got that one.
01 05 41 30 CC Roger. The Cowboys were destroyed by the
 Cleveland Browns yesterday. The Pueblo crew is
 expected to be released. And I now hear our air-to-ground

01 05 42 13 CC Thank you.
01 05 42 17 CDR Houston, be advised that it looks like your
 Quindars are clipping your voice during your
 transmission.
01 05 42 25 CC Roger, Understand. Are we still experiencing
 this intermittent condition that was there a
 few minutes ago?
01 05 42 33 CDR Not always, but often in the beginning and in
 the end of your transmission.
01 05 42 39 CC Roger. Understand. I'll give it a little extra
 time.
01 05 45 44 CC Go.
01 05 45 52 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
01 05 46 01 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Could you try to find us a
 better OMNI antenna? Over.

01 06 10 38 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
01 06 10 39 CC Okay. S-band OFF state to OFF. That returns
 us to normal configuration, and we need a couple
 or items from you. First, the CMP and LMP status
 report (including PRD readings on all three crewmembers),
 and we'd like to know did you chlorinate
 the water after your last meal. Over.
01 06 11 10 CDR No, we haven't chlorinated the water, yet. We'll
 get the other for you.
01 06 11 13 CC Roger. Thank you.
01 06 11 14 LMP Houston, do you show the FM - Houston, Apollo 8 -
 do you show the FM on now?
01 06 11 22 CC Stand by and we'll check it, Bill.
01 06 11 26 LMP Because our S-baud off state has been OFF. Possibly
 - we don't have control or it.
01 06 12 29 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We've switched on all the
 communications switch; functions are operating
 normally, Bill.

01 06 12 59 CC Good. I copy 0.04, 0.64, 0.25. Thank you.
01 06 13 06 CDR Roger.
01 06 22 25 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8.
01 06 22 33 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
01 06 22 37 CDR Oh, hi, Ken. How are you doing?
01 06 22 39 CC Roger. Fine. How you been?
01 06 22 41 CDR Is this Jerry?
01 06 22 42 CC This is Ken.
01 06 22 44 CDR Hey, listen, we still have this TV coming up
 here - let's see - 31:20?
01 06 22 52 CC Affirmative.
01 06 23 00 CDR We're about in the right position for high gain;
 we wondered if you wanted to take a trial run
 and see if it will work. Or do you just want to
 wait and try it when they're supposed to go on
 the air with it?
01 06 23 18 CC Okay. Stand by on that.
01 06 23 23 CDR Okay.
01 06 30 25 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
01 06 30 27 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
01 06 30 33 LMP Roger. Could you ask the GNC to give us an update
 on our prop quantity, please?
01 06 30 41 CC Wilco. You're referring to the RCS?
01 06 30 46 LMP Roger.

Tape 22
Page 4
01 06 30 53 LMP If you'll give it to me kinda slow, I'll plot it.
01 06 30 56 CC Roger. It's coming now.
01 06 35 13 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 06 35 19 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
01 06 35 20 CC Okay. In reference the early TV, we're losing
 the high-gain antenna now, and it looks like the
 only way we would have gotten the early TV pass
 in anyhow was to send it to remote site and
 look at it there. So we're going to scrub
 that idea and we'll just pick up with the
 scheduled TV. The COMM checks that are remaining
 are the high-gain dependent type, and
 we'll put those off until the TV session is completed,
 and we are working on the fuel propellant
 curve for you now.
01 06 35 53 CDR Thank you.
01 06 41 50 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 06 41 53 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
01 06 41 54 CC Okay, Apollo 8. What we're going to do on the
 TV is to go ahead and let you crank it up as
 soon as we get back on the high-gain antenna,
 and it looks like - my guess is that this will
 be about 31:07, and we'll just use this to - as
 long as we have the coverage there. I have an
 update to your TLI plus 35 PAD. Now we have to
 correct a couple of tines on there. So when you
 get that out, let me know and I'll read it to you.

Tape 22
Page 5
01 06 42 38 CDR Go ahead.
01 06 42 40 CC Okay. On the TLI plus 35 pass, the update I
 want to give you is the last three lines in the
 block: the EMS range to go 13084 35985 0984217.
 Over.
01 06 43 11 CDR Understand. Range to go 13084 35985 0984217.
01 06 43 21 CC Affirmative.
01 06 44 54 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We are about to have a handover
 to Goldstone, and our downlink isn't improved
 then. I don't know if you'll notice any difference
 in the uplink or not.
01 06 45 52 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 06 46 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 06 46 48 CDR Go ahead, Houston. You are loud and clear.
01 06 46 51 CC Okay. We have switched sites over to Goldstone
 now. I don't know if you can tell any difference
 in our uplink.
01 06 47 01 CDR Negative. You're about the same.
01 06 47 03 CC Okay. You have cleared up quite a bit. Sounds
 a lot better to us.
01 06 47 08 CDR Okay.
01 06 49 35 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 06 49 38 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
01 06 49 40 CC I have some RCS quantity data for you. We are
 all set up to receive the TV whenever you get
 high gain looking at us.

Tape 22
Page 6
01 06 49 51 CDR Okay. Let me get the chart out here.
01 06 50 20 CDR Go ahead with the quad propellant quantities,
 please.
01 06 50 25 CC Okay, Apollo 8, Alfa, I have 225 pounds, 74 percent;
 Bravo 240 - -
01 06 50 41 CDR Slower, please.
01 06 50 42 CC Roger. I will repeat. Alfa 225, 74 percent;
 Bravo 240 pounds, 79 percent; Charlie 236,
 78 percent; Delta 238, 19 percent. I would
 like to remind you on the TV that we need narrow
 beam width when you get up in high gain.
 Over.
01 06 51 45 CDR Roger. Understand.
01 07 07 18 CDR Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
01 07 07 20 CC Loud sad clear, Apollo 8.
01 07 07 24 CDR Okay. Thank you.

01 07 09 59 CC Apollo 8. Loud and clear and standing by.
01 07 10 04 CDR Say again.
01 07 10 05 CC We read you loud and clear, and we're standing
 by.
01 07 10 09 CDR Okay.
01 07 10 23 CDR Are you receiving television now?
01 07 10 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We just got it.
01 07 10 43 CDR You are getting it?
01 07 10 52 CC Okay, Apollo 8. We have a good picture.

Tape 22
Page 7
01 07 10 54 CDR We're rolling a -
01 07 10 57 CDR Okay. We're rolling around to a good view of
 the earth, and as soon as we get to the good
 view of the earth, we'll stop and let you look
 out the window at the scene that we see. Jim
 Lovell's down in lower equipment bay preparing
 lunch, and Bill is holding a camera here for us
 both.
01 07 11 29 CDR Bill's going to take the camera down to the lower
 equipment deck with Jim.
01 07 11 34 CC Roger.
01 07 11 37 CC Okay. We're getting a pretty good picture, but
 if you'd move it a little slower - every time
 you move it around, it breaks up the scan.
01 07 11 47 CDR We gotcha.
01 07 11 49 CC (Laughter)
01 07 11 54 CMP This is known as preparing lunch and doing P23
 at the same time.
01 07 12 18 CC You've got everybody standing on their heads
 down here.
01 07 12 23 CDR How go - Has he got it turned upside down? You've
 got the wrong REFSMMAT.
01 07 12 31 CC Well, we all have our problems.
01 07 12 44 CDR How is the picture now, Houston?
01 07 12 46 CC They are really good.
01 07 12 52 CDR Okay. Now we are coming up on the view that we
 really want you to see. That's the view of the

Tape 22
Page 8
 earth, and if you will break for just a minute,
 Bill is going to put on the large lens. So we
 will be right back with you.
01 07 13 03 CC Okay. Thank you.
01 07 13 54 CDR Houston, we are now showing you a view of the
 earth through the telephoto lens.
01 07 14 00 CC Okay. We are not receiving a picture right now.
01 07 14 08 CDR How about now?
01 07 14 14 CC Okay. We don't have a picture yet.
01 07 14 27 CDR You seeing anything at all, Houston?
01 07 14 36 CC Okay, Apollo 8. We don't have a picture yet.
01 07 14 46 CDR Alright. We will put the other lens back on, and
 we will show you that.
01 07 14 50 CC Apollo 8, how about standing by on that for
 just a minute. Let's check our ground link.
01 07 15 06 CC Apollo 8, we have a picture now.
01 07 15 10 CDR Okay. Let's try the other lens again then, once
 again.
01 07 15 13 CC Okay. Thank you.
01 07 15 30 CDR Do you have a picture now?
01 07 15 31 CC That's negative.
01 07 15 45 CC Apollo 8, ...
01 07 15 54 CDR Okay. Do you have anything. Houston? We have
 it on the earth.
01 07 15 58 CC We are having no joy.
01 07 16 02 CDR Okay. Standby.
01 07 16 04 CDR Okay. How about now, Houston?

Tape 22
Page 9
01 07 16 10 CC Still no joy.
01 07 16 18 CC You don't have a lens cover on there, do you?
01 07 16 22 CDR No. We checked that, as a matter of fact.
01 07 16 30 CDR Anything?
01 07 16 32 CC Still no joy.
01 07 16 56 CDR How about now?
01 07 16 57 CC Still no joy. There is a picture. We have a picture.
 Okay. It is a little difficult to see
 what we have.
01 07 17 17 CDR That is the earth, but it is not the telephoto
 lens, unfortunately. It is just a regular inside
 lens.
01 07 17 23 CC Okay. It is coming in as a real bright blob on
 the screen. It is hard to tell what we are
 looking at.
01 07 17 31 CDR You are looking through some haze on the windows
 too, unfortunately.
01 07 17 37 CMP And the earth is very bright, besides.
01 07 17 41 CC Okay. We got the earth in about the center of
 the screen and a little bit low, and it looked
 like there were some objects that moved across
 it - the screen at the same time. Do you have
 any comment on those?
01 07 17 54 CDR That is some of the water - ice coming off the
 vent nozzle.
01 07 17 59 CC Roger.

Tape 22
Page 10
01 07 18 05 CDR How does it look now?
01 07 18 06 CC Still the same thing; it is - the target is
 extremely bright, and it is very difficult to
 make out what we are looking at.
01 07 18 16 CDR It is unfortunate that we do not have - we can't
 make the other lens work here. I don't know
 what the problem is.
01 07 18 24 CC Okay. Apollo 8, would you verify that the ALC
 is on?
01 07 18 33 CDR We have tried it both ways.
01 07 18 35 CC Oh, okay; thank you. What we are getting now is
 a good picture.
01 07 18 39 CDR Say again.
01 07 18 44 CC Okay. That's a - that's a real good picture.
 That is the best one that we have had. And how
 about going ahead and just leaving your pictures
 inside until we can think some more of what we
 can do to adjust for that light?
01 07 18 58 CDR Roger. Jim, what are you doing here? Jim is
 fixing dessert. He is making up a bag of chocolate
 pudding. You can see it come floating by.
 Bill is coming up from the lower equipment bay.
 It is unfortunate that this telephoto lens.
 doesn't work. Show them the lens that's the
 culprit here, Jim. This lens doesn't seem to
 be working; I can't understand why we're not -

Tape 22
Page 11
 perhaps it's a problem of light transmission
 through it.
01 07 19 56 CDR This transmission is coming to you approximately
 halfway between the moon and the earth. We have
 been 31 hours and about 20 minutes into flight.
 We have about less than 40 hours to go to the
 moon. You can see that Bill has his toothbrush
 here. He has been brushing regularly. To demonstrate
 how things float around in zero g. It
 looks like he plays for the Astros, the way he
 tries to catch those things. I certainly wish
 that we could show you the earth. It is a
 beautiful, beautiful view, with predominately
 blue background and just huge covers of white
 clouds, particularly one very strong vortex up
 near the terminator. Very, very beautiful.
 Perhaps we will get some assistance from the
 people on the ground and be able to deter - to
 determine why this other lens is not transmitting
 properly.
01 07 21 11 LMP Houston, did you get any light at all coming
 through that telephoto lens?
01 07 21 18 CC Apollo 8, we were getting what you were showing
 us on your normal lens, and I don't think we got
 anything on the telephoto. We are working on
 this now. One of the problems seems to be that

Tape 22
Page 12
 it is a low light level lens; we're afraid that
 you might burn it out pointing it at something
 too bright.
01 07 21 40 CDR Well, the earth is very, very bright. There is
 nothing in the lens you can burn out. The camera
 still seems to be working. We can give you
 a lumens reading of the earth right now if
 you like.
01 07 21 54 CC Hey, Frank, how about a couple of words on your
 health for the wide world.
01 07 22 03 CDR Well, we are all in very good shape. Jim is
 busy working preparing lunch. Bill is playing
 cameraman right now, and I am about to take a
 light reading on the earth. We all feel fine.
 It was a very exciting ride on that big Saturn,
 but it worked perfectly, and we are looking
 forward now, of course, for the day after tomorrow
 when we will be just 60 miles any from the
 moon.
01 07 22 33 CC Roger. You all look great on candid TV.
01 07 22 44 CDR Okay. I just got a reading on the earth, Houston.
 It is 320. The earth is showing 320 lumens now.
 If you get a closeup of Jim Lovell, Bill, you
 can let everyone see he has already outdistanced
 us in the beard race. Jim has got quite a beard
 going already.

Tape 22
Page 13
01 07 23 28 CMP Happy birthday, Mother.
01 07 23 49 CDR Okay. Jim is going to take a shot of us from
 the lower equipment bay, and then we have to get
 back to our passive thermal control in the bar-b-que
 mode so that we don't get one side of the
 spacecraft too hot for too long at a time. So
 we will be signing off here, and we will be
 looking forward to seeing you all again shortly.
01 07 24 10 CC Roger.
01 07 24 13 CDR Goodbye from Apollo 8.
01 07 24 17 CC Thank you. That's a good show.
01 07 24 24 CDR I hope we can get that other lens fixed or some
 reading on it.
01 07 24 31 CC Roger. We are going to work on that one. The
 one that is sensitive to light is the lens that
 you were just using. You want to be careful
 about pointing that at some bright object.
01 07 24 43 CDR Roger. We are starting PTC again.
01 07 24 45 LMP I believe that's only if it hasn't been used for
 quite a while, Ken.

01 07 40 04 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 07 40 08 CDR Go ahead Houston, Apollo 8.
01 07 40 10 CC Okay, I've got a few items for you I'd like to
 clear up and then we'll let you alone for a
 while. The first thing is we would like for you
 to confirm that your spot meter had an ASA setting
 of 100.
01 07 40 27 CDR That is confirmed.
01 07 40 30 CC Okay, we thank you. That's one of the first
 questions that came to mind. We are ready for
 a cryo fan cycle at any time and use your normal
 procedures.
01 07 40 47 CDR Okay.
01 07 40 49 CC All right. You can anticipate a fuel cell purge
 at 35 hours, and we ought to be through with
 battery A charging somewhere after 34 hours; and
 looks like you'll have just about a full battery
 there. And we will give you a call on the exact
 time to cut it off. We would like to get some
 confirmation from you on the chlorine procedures.
 Did you get some in last night or not? Just a
 quick summary of how much sleep you got on Lovell
 and Anders?
01 07 41 26 CDR Okay. We got the chlorine in and the water has
 been chlorinated and just a minute I will check
 with them on their sleep.

Tape 23
Page 2
01 07 41 40 CC I am sorry I didn't copy that sleep.
01 07 41 44 CDR Say again, Ken.
01 07 41 46 CC I am sorry I didn't copy your last, Frank.
01 07 41 50 CDR I was asking you to say, to say what you said.
 Jim had about 4 hours sleep, and Bill had about
 3 hours sleep.
01 07 42 07 CC Okay. Thank you very much.
01 07 42 12 CDR We feel pretty good today. We would like to see,
 in looking over the flight plan - perhaps we ought
 to put the rest periods a little bit shorter and
 more frequent. It seems it might work out better.
 We got all out of kilter on it yesterday. We
 are sort of trying to get back in a normal cycle.
01 07 42 32 CC Okay. We will look into that.
01 07 42 44 CDR You all are doing good work. Keep it up.
01 07 42 46 CC Thank you. Looks like the only other
 thing we have left over is a COMM check and if
 we can work that in without interrupting your
 present schedule we would like to.
01 07 42 58 CDR Okay. Right now we are stopping for a break,
 but we will go ahead and do that. What does it
 involve?
01 07 43 06 CC Okay. We will need the high-gain antenna, and
 there should be no COMM loss during this mode.
01 07 43 22 CDR Okay, Ken. I think we are going to lose the high
 gain here shortly. Why don't we pick it up next
 time it comes around?

Tape 23
Page 3
01 07 43 27 CC Real fine.
01 07 43 31 CDR Remember, the most important part of the trip
 occurs in two days when we start back. So you
 all get better rested too.
01 07 43 40 CC We'll do that.
01 07 43 41 CC Affirmative, Apollo 8.
01 07 52 41 CDR Houston, we're starting the H<sub>2</sub> fan now.
01 07 52 51 CC Roger, thank you.
01 07 54 48 CDR Houston, you just wanted 2 minutes cycling on
 those fans don't you? Two minutes each?
01 07 55 04 CC That's affirmative, Apollo 8.
01 07 55 08 CDR Roger.
01 08 06 07 CDR Houston, Apollo 8 on high gain stand by for your
 communications check.
01 08 06 12 CC Okay, standing by.
01 08 11 26 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 08 11 31 CDR Go ahead Houston, Apollo 8.
01 08 11 33 CC Okay. Apollo 8. Looks like we're going to have
 to put this COMM test off because of some tracking
 requirements. We can do it in about an hour if
 this will not interfere with your present operations
 too much. It'll take maybe 15 to 20 minutes,
 and it will involve some conversation on the part
 of the people onboard the spacecraft. So if that's
 going to interfere with your sleeping and all, why
 go ahead and we'll defer to that and we'll pick

Tape 23
Page 4
 these requirements up at another time. And,
 we've got a score here, looks like Baltimore 21
 to nothing.
01 08 12 16 CDR Who were they playing?
01 08 12 26 CC How about Minnesota.
01 08 12 30 CDR That's from that other league.
01 08 22 33 CMP How did last year's Army-Navy game come out?
01 08 22 47 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
01 08 22 49 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
01 08 22 53 LMP Roger. We've stirred up all the cryos. Could
 you give me your quantities, please?
01 08 23 00 CC Okay. Stand by.
01 08 23 04 LMP Roger. Be advised the CMP just hit the hay for
 awhile, and the LMP will go down in a little while.
01 08 23 12 CC Okay. And our guys down here are watching high-gain
 antenna pointing program, so anytime you're
 not using the DSKY for anything else, they'd like
 to watch it for a couple of cycles, so if you
 would leave that NOUN 51 on the display it will
 help a lot down here.
01 08 23 31 LMP Okay. Why don't you give us REACQ angles, and
 we'll try that for the next time.
01 08 23 44 CC Okay.
01 08 24 37 CC Apollo 8, are you ready to copy some cryo quantities?
01 08 24 45 LMP I'm ready. How about O<sub>2</sub> first.

Tape 23
Page 5
01 08 24 47 CC Okay. O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, I show 88.1 percent.
01 08 24 55 LMP Okay. Could you give it to me in pounds, please?
01 08 25 02 CC Okay. You'll have to stand by while we convert
 that.
01 08 25 05 LMP Thank you.
01 08 25 15 LMP That's okay, Gene, go ahead, I'll take the percent.
01 08 25 19 CC Okay. We will try and get the pounds for you, too,
 Bill. Tank 1, oxygen 88.1.
01 08 25 29 LMP What time is that for?
01 08 25 30 CC This is present.
01 08 25 34 LMP 32:30, okay.
01 08 25 38 CC Okay, I've got 32:35. And O<sub>2</sub> - -
01 08 25 45 LMP In weight not percentage.
01 08 25 46 CC Okay, O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, 88.1, O<sub>2</sub> tank 2, 87.37.
01 08 26 14 LMP Is that 0.37 or 0.36?
01 08 26 17 CC 0.37.
01 08 26 22 LMP Roger, 2. Got it.
01 08 26 23 CC Okay, 2 tank 1, 75.97. Tank 2, 78.06. Over.
01 08 26 50 LMP Okay, thank you very much. It looks good.
01 08 26 52 CC Okay, thank you.
01 08 40 03 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 08 40 07 CDR Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 8.
01 08 40 10 CC Okay. I've got a couple of things we need from
 you. I would like to get a battery C voltage.
 I would like to check a battery manifold pressure.
 Your high gain - -

Tape 23
Page 6
01 08 40 25 CDR Battery C is 37 volts.
01 08 40 28 CC Understand 37 volts on battery C. Is that affirm?
01 08 40 32 CDR 3, 7.
01 08 40 34 CC Okay, thank you. And if you can get to the
 battery manifold pressure, like to read that one.
01 08 40 42 CDR 0.6 volts.
01 08 40 44 CC All right understand 0.6 volts. The angles you
 asked for on the high-gain antenna are pitch minus
 45, and yaw 90.
01 08 41 43 CDR Okay. Houston, this is Apollo 8. I'm going to
 just go into high gain now, and we're about ready
 to pick you up ... works on REACQ.
01 08 41 50 CC Okay, and I have a scanning telescope star visibility
 item for you to pick up, when you're ready to
 copy that.
01 08 42 06 CDR Roger, we'll get that on high gain when we get
 back to you.
01 08 42 10 CC Okay, thank you.
01 08 42 11 CDR We'll come back on high-gain.
01 08 42 12 CC Roger.
01 08 42 23 CDR That's not fair, we're there already.
01 08 42 28 CC That's pretty good acquisition, huh?
01 08 42 34 CDR You guys are reading the DSKY. Go ahead Houston.
01 08 42 40 CC Okay, Apollo 8. Maybe we ought to try that one
 again next time, and the scanning telescope star
 visibility is scheduled for a 34:10 in the flight

Tape 23
Page 7
 plan, and it'll be star number 31. The angles
 are roll 184.7, pitch 23.4, yaw 14.3, shaft and
 trunnion zero. Over.
01 08 43 28 CDR Understand; star 31, roll 184 7, pitch 23 4,
 yaw 14 3, and star shaft and trunnion at zero.
01 08 43 38 CC That's affirm, and that's copy star 31.
01 08 43 45 CDR That's Roger, 31.
01 08 43 47 CC Okay, thank you.
01 08 44 18 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
01 08 44 20 CC Go ahead.
01 08 44 24 LMP The LMP would like to take a Seconal and hit
 the hay.
01 08 44 36 CC Okay. That's a GO.
01 08 44 41 LMP Okay, thank you.
01 08 44 45 LMP And that ...
01 08 50 06 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 08 50 10 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
01 08 50 12 CC Okay. We'd like to go ahead and get into this
 COMM check here, on the last of this high-gain
 period. If you're ready to go on it I'll read
 you some witches.
01 08 50 27 CDR Standby. We're ready. Go ahead.
01 08 50 29 CC Okay. Number 1. S-band normal mode voice to
 VOICE.
01 08 50 43 CDR Go ahead - keep going.
01 08 50 44 CC Uptelemetry data to DATA.

Tape 23
Page 8
01 08 51 08 CC CDR Normal mode voice to VOICE. Uptelemetry data
 to DATA.
01 08 51 12 CC Okay, uptelemetry command to NORMAL.
01 08 51 17 CDR NORMAL.
01 08 51 18 CC High-gain antenna track, AUTO.
01 08 51 25 CDR Roger. Going AUTO.
01 08 51 27 CC High-gain antenna beam width to NARROW.
01 08 51 30 CDR Beam-width NARROW.
01 08 51 33 CC Okay, this will be our base-line data check.
 This will be a full uplink voice with ranging
 and full downlink.
01 08 57 53 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We are going to have to delay
 the COMM check again.
01 09 01 09 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. how do you read?
01 09 01 13 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Did you call?
01 09 01 18 CDR Roger. We lost you for a while there. Are you
 reading us there now?
01 09 01 20 CC Loud and clear now.
01 09 01 24 CDR Okay. Thank you. So are we.
01 09 01 36 CC Okay, Apollo 8. Do you want to try that AUTO
 REACQ? 33 plus 24 looks like a good time and the
 angles are the same. And the late ball scores is 24 to 14 - -
01 09 01 48 CDR ...
01 09 01 51 CC All right.
01 09 01 53 CDR Say it again.

Tape 23
Page 9
01 09 01 54 CC I say a late ball score there is - -
01 09 01 55 CDR ... the ball score?
01 09 01 56 CC 2, 4 to 1, 4.
01 09 02 02 CDR Baltimore over the Vikings?
01 09 02 05 CC Affirm.
01 09 05 56 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
01 09 05 58 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
01 09 06 02 CDR We have reached the scan limit on the high gain.
 what do you want us to do about it now?
01 09 06 39 CC Apollo 8, what we would like to do with these
 angles is to set it in AUTO REACQ over on panel 2,
 and it is under the tracking for the high-gain
 antenna, and it'll - the lower position will say
 REACQ, and on the position dials we would like
 to set pitch to minus 45 and the yaw to 90.
01 09 07 08 CDR Pitch minus 45, yaw 90.
01 09 07 10 CC Okay. Stand by 1.
01 09 07 15 CDR Roger. If we could leave it in REACQ if you want
 to use the high gain, it would keep from waking us
 up every REV.
END OF TAPE

Tape 24
Page 1
01 09 10 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston. I think we may have gotten
 off on a tangent. These pitch and yaw angles
 that we called up to you for the high gain
 antenna were in response to Bill's request to
 know what positions we could put on there for a
 - for the AUTO REACQ position. The constraint
 still remains if we don't want to be on an OMNI
 antenna at the same time. We are in the AUTO
 REACQ position; we should be in one or the
 other. So you can use that information if you
 want to try it out. Otherwise, the procedures
 you've been using all along will be just fine.
 Over.
01 09 15 41 CC Apollo 8, Houston. I am transmitting in the
 blind right now. Our downlink isn't working
 so well; I'm just going ahead on an uplink.
01 09 20 00 CDR Houston, do you read? Apollo 8.
01 09 20 03 CC Apollo 8, read you weak but clear now.
01 09 20 08 CDR Roger. Thank you.
01 09 20 10 CC Okay. Looks like we had a ground problem there.
01 09 20 18 CDR Roger.
01 09 33 31 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 09 33 34 CDR Go ahead.
01 09 33 38 CC - okay. Looks like we're - -
01 09 33 39 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
01 09 33 40 CC - - Looks like we're in a good attitude to try
 this high-gain antenna on the COMM check one

Tape 24
Page 2
 more time. I believe you're still on an OMNI.
 Is that correct?
01 09 33 52 CDR Roger.
01 09 33 55 CC Okay. If we could try the high gain and maybe
 we can get started on this COMM check. I'd also
 like to verify that you've got the LMP and the
 CMP trying to get some sleep here, and we could
 use an oral temp from you, too.
01 09 34 16 CDR Roger. My temperature is 97.5.
01 09 34 20 CC Okay. Thank you.
01 09 34 24 CDR That's what it was this morning when I felt badly.
01 09 34 26 CC Alright; thank you.
01 09 35 24 CDR Do you want me to go to OMNI now, Ken?
01 09 35 26 CC I'd like for you to go to high gain.
01 09 35 28 CDR High gain?
01 09 35 29 CC Yes, sir.
01 09 35 33 CDR High gain.
01 09 35 40 CDR This is Apollo 8 on high gain.
01 09 35 44 CC Roger. Reading you kind of weak now, but we're
 gonna take a look at it.
01 09 36 24 CDR Houston, Apollo 8 on high gain.
01 09 36 27 CC Okay. I'm reading you loud with just a little
 background noise.
01 09 36 33 CDR Roger.
01 09 39 24 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're not getting a good lock.
 I wonder if we could try making sure that we're in

Page 3
 AUTO on the tracks and that we're in narrow beam
 width?
01 09 39 39 CDR Standby.
01 09 40 00 CDR How's that, Houston?
01 09 40 04 CC Okay. That works reel good.
01 09 42 07 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. What we're doing right
 now is collecting baseline data, and we'll be in
 this mode for another couple of minutes and then
 we'll be moving out to the second signal.
01 09 43 55 CC Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read?
01 09 44 22 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 09 44 27 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. Read you five-by.
01 09 44 30 CC Okay. We are ... we have some ground problems,
 and we're reading you weak but clear. We're
 ready to start into our test. We're going to be
 changing our modes so you'll probably hear a
 burst of noise as we make the change. This
 will be a noise that sounds like an S-band onlock.
 However, your AEC leader will lock that off.
 This is due to the loss of modulation on the uplink.
 There will be about 2 minutes, and during
 this time, you will hear one burst of noise.
01 09 45 39 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Voice check. Over.
01 09 45 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Ready to check.
01 09 46 20 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 09 46 38 CC Apollo 8, Houston.

Tape 24
Page 4
01 09 46 43 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
01 09 46 48 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Do you read?
01 09 46 53 LMP That's affirmative.
01 09 46 54 CC Okay. Thank you. Were you reading all along?
 We just - This is the first time we've heard you
 call back.
01 09 47 02 LMP We've been reading you; we're trying to hold the
 noise down so we can get some sleep.
01 09 47 09 CC Roger. We'll be through with this in just a
 minute, I think.
01 09 47 13 LMP Roger. I will answer you, but I'll try to do
 it quietly.
01 09 47 18 CC Okay, Bill.
01 09 47 45 CC Okay, Apollo 8. The next portion of our test is
 like we did yesterday; We'll be changing the
 uplink modes to uplink command and ranging with
 no upvoice. We'll be in this mode for approximately
 2 and 1/2 minutes and send two test messages.
 During this time, we will not have uplink.
 We are going to this mode at time 33:48:30, and
 we'll be back in this configuration at 33:50:00.
 Over.
01 09 50 59 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check.
01 09 51 05 LMP Loud and clear, Houston.
01 09 51 07 CC Okay, fine. How about telemetry inputs PCM switch
 to LOW, please?

Tape 24
Page 5
01 09 51 17 LMP They're in LOW, Houston.
01 09 51 24 CC Roger.
01 09 52 53 CC Apollo 8, we've completed the third test; we're
 going into the final test now. PCM switch to
 HIGH, please.
01 09 54 01 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're going to switch uplink
 to the upvoice backup for about 2 minutes, and
 may take a few seconds to link the transition.
 And we'll be back up at 33:56 in our normal
 mode to place the up-telemetry data switch to
 upvoice backup at this time. Over.
01 09 54 28 LMP Roger.
01 09 55 54 CC Apollo 8, Houston on backup voice.
01 09 56 00 LMP Loud and clear, Houston.
01 09 56 02 CC Okay, fine; thank you.
01 09 56 21 CC Apollo 8, let's go back up-telemetry data
 switch to DATA.
01 09 57 12 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 09 57 29 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 09 58 56 CC Stand by; guess we've got 85-foot site voice
 back now; the noise went away.
01 09 59 02 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 09 59 10 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
01 09 59 17 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
01 09 59 19 CC Okay, Apollo 8. That completes our COMM test.
 Thanks for your cooperation. And I've got a

Tape 24
Page 6
 change here to NAV sightings that will come up
 at 32:20. And we want to change your star a
 little bit there. Are you ready to copy?
01 09 59 38 LMP Ready to copy.
01 09 59 40 CC Okay.
01 09 59 41 LMP Ready to copy.
01 09 59 43 CC Okay, Apollo 8. We would like to change the
 NAV sighting as follows: we would like to use
 star 26, that is, two-six; we would like to
 make it earth-near horizon for two sets, two sets.
 Then we would like to take star 16 earth-far
 horizon, one set. If star 26 earth-near horizon
 56 not possible, star 16 earth-far horizon, one
 set, and star 22 earth-far horizon, one set.
 Over.
01 10 00 36 CDR Roger, Houston. Be advised the CMP is asleep
 ... putting those on for a while.
01 10 00 45 CC Okay. Stand by.
01 10 01 34 CC Apollo 8, okay; we can put this off. What we will
 probably need from you is some kind of an estimate
 of when you think somebody will be available
 to work on it, and we are working on how much
 lead time we need now.
01 10 01 56 LMP Stand by ...
01 10 01 58 CC Roger.

Tape 24
Page 7
01 10 02 08 CDR Houston, why don't you figure the CMP will sleep
 another couple of hours, then the LMP, and then
 the CDR up to about 43 hours equally. Over.
01 10 02 20 CC Okay.
01 10 02 25 CDR Then we will start off with the CMP again at
 about 44.
01 10 06 58 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 10 07 03 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
01 10 07 05 CC Okay. We can put off this NAV sighting. It was
 scheduled here at 34:20, and we can put it off,
 Judging from your comments about sleeping, we
 would like to get it as soon as we can, and
 right now, our plans are to slide it 2 hours.
 We will do the P52 by sliding it back to the same
 thing since it is associated with the P23. So
 If that's a convenient time for you, why we will
 plan on that.
01 10 07 38 CDR We are doing the P52 now. Do you want us to
 continue?
01 10 07 43 CC Well, as far as we are concerned, that isn't
 going to help us any. We will have to do it
 over again anyhow.
01 10 07 54 CDR Okay. And what time do you want to do it?
01 10 07 57 CC Well, if you think Jim's going to be up in a
 couple of hours, why that will slide us 2 hours
 to 36:20.

Tape 24
Page 8
01 10 08 08 CDR Okay. We will go ahead and make another one there
 and pick it up then if that's okay.
01 10 08 12 CC Okay. That will be real fine. Thank you.
01 10 08 17 CDR What we are going to try to do is get back on
 the sleep cycle to those sleep periods just prior
 to LOI by taking shorter cycles for each man.
01 10 08 29 CC Real fine.
01 10 13 52 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
01 10 13 57 CC Apollo 8, go ahead.
01 10 14 01 CDR How about giving us some REACQ angles, and we'll.
 stay in REACQ.
01 10 14 05 CC Say again, please.
01 10 14 11 CDR Could you give us some REACQ angles?
01 10 14 14 CC Wilco.
01 10 14 24 CDR Say again.
01 10 14 29 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. I hadn't said anything
 at that time. We're digging some angles
 out for you now. In reference to your earlier
 question about the sleep cycle juggling and so
 forth: we agree with your comment. We would
 like to get back on the flight plan as far as
 the sleep cycles and so forth are concerned by
 the time we get into lunar orbit. So we'd like
 for you to use your own judgment about the most
 efficient way to accommodate the sleep cycles and
 proportion it up among yourselves. We would like

Tape 24
Page 9
 to have you keep us informed of who's doing what
 and what your plans are. We have the one P23 that
 we had slipped 2 hours. We'd like to get the
 other one in. We can also adjust the time for
 the other P23, if it's going to conflict - I
 guess that's two more P23's. We can adjust the
 time for those if you'll let us know what your
 forecast is for when Jim will be available to
 take some sightings. So the big message is that
 we'd like to work around whatever your desires
 are. If you'll let us know, we'll pick some stars
 and some angles and have them ready for you.
01 10 15 44 CDR Okay, Houston. The CMP will be up at 36 hours.
 The LMP is going to sleep now, and he'll sleep
 through until 40 and then I'll stagger that in
 and try to go to sleep around 30 to 37 so
 that by the time we get to day 3 we'll all be
 back on the same direct sleep cycle.
01 10 16 12 CC Okay, real fine. Thank you.
01 10 16 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston. REACQ angles look like minus
 45 in pitch, plus 90 in yaw, and 34:23 for the
 time.
01 10 16 41 CDR Roger. Copy. This is good using REACQ because
 it keeps the caution and warning from going off again.
01 10 16 48 CC Roger. I understand that. Are you leaving the
 high-gain antenna on after it swings over to
 the reset position?

Tape 24
Page 10
01 10 17 04 CDR Do you have any reason for us to use the high-gain
 antenna?
01 10 17 10 F EECOM, do you think we need that, really, very
 much?
01 10 17 13 CC Standby.
01 10 17 15 F Why can we just not use the high-gain antenna
 for a while? Getting high bit rate on the OMNI's.
 Okay, let's tell them that we'll just not worry
 about the OMNI for a while.
01 10 18 30 LMP Houston, this is the LMP. Before I hit the sack,
 could you give me a rundown on our systems the way
 you see them?
01 10 18 37 CC Okay, we'll put that together for you and we
 were just talking about the redundant ECS components
 check and we were going to put that off
 until everybody's had a chance to get some sleep.
 Trying to keep you from having going to the
 left-hand couch.
01 10 18 54 LMP Oh, that would be nice. I sent Lovell under the
 couch, though. I've got one man sleeping under
 the left couch here - right couch and one man
 sleeping on our right couch.
01 10 19 33 CC Okay. I understand you've got one under and
 one on the right couch.
01 10 19 39 LMP Roger. That's affirmed.

Tape 24
Page 11
01 10 19 41 CC Okay. And in reference to the OMNI versus the
 high gain, it looks like we can live with the OMNI
 antennas here for several more hours, if you would
 like to delete the use of the high gain.
01 10 20 10 LMP Okay. Goodnight, Houston.
01 10 20 16 CC Okay. Before you pitch your eyeballs there, we'd
 like to terminate the battery charge.
01 10 20 25 LMP I knew you guys would get me.
01 10 20 27 CC Got you.
01 10 20 35 LMP Okay. The battery A charge is terminated at
 37.3 volts.
01 10 20 41 CC Okay. Thank you.
01 10 20 54 LMP Standing by for your systems status.
01 10 20 56 CC Okay. We're pulling that together now.
01 10 21 01 LMP How are the PU valve and SPS line temps looking?
01 10 21 05 CC Okay, I'll test that.
01 10 21 06 LMP We just had ... I understand.
01 10 25 53 LMP Systems look okay to you Houston?
01 10 26 09 CC Okay, Apollo 8. All the systems - giving a quick
 look around the room - look real fine. You've
 got an RCS quad update on the quantity, so you
 have that information. The SPS oxidizer feed-line
 temperature and the fuel temperature are
 both at 73 degrees. The cryo profile is running
 right on the line: Battery A - our calculations
 have 39.63 amp hours. Battery B, 37.94, and

Tape 24
Page 12
 battery Charlie, 38.46. The COMM continues to
 be running ahead of predictions in quality end
 circuit margins. Everything else looks like
 it's real fine.
01 10 27 06 LMP Roger. Do you expect to have a low bit rate voice
 on the DSE off the OMNI's at lunar distances?
01 10 27 23 CC That's negative on DSE off the OMNI's. Not
 looking forward to that much improvement.
01 10 27 32 LMP Roger. We need about a 30-foot dish, I figure,
 for that on the spacecraft.
01 10 27 47 CC Roger. It runs up the fuel required for PTC,
 though, Bill.
01 10 27 56 LMP Roger.
01 10 39 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 10 39 40 CDR Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 8.
01 10 39 42 CC Okay. I know you're trying to be quiet, so I'll
 just read up some information to you. One of
 the things that we just turned up that might give
 you some confidence, if you lose oxygen cryo tank
 now: you have 80 pounds remaining now at CM/SM
 SEP. The limiting factor on single tank operation
 right now is the hydrogen tank which has a
 positive margin at CM/SM SEP, assuming our standard
 profile gives you about 143 hours. So it looks
 like you are over the hill on those. Notice that
 you're flying in the rate 2 position for you BMAGS

Tape 24.
Page 13
 which is fine. Only make sure that you still
 were maintaining a PTC attitude. Looks like
 you're pretty close to it.
01 10 40 41 CDR Roger. We are flying PTC, and I was wondering
 why it was going out of the deadband; now I know.
 Thank you.
01 10 40 47 CC Okay. Thank you.
01 10 40 51 CDR That's what happens when you let Anders fly.
 He's asleep so he can't defend himself.
01 10 41 12 CC Roger. But we've got it on tape though.
01 10 41 17 CDR Good. They're both conked out; how about just
 filling me in on some news, and I'll keep quiet
 just to give me some words on what's going on in
 the world.
01 10 41 34 CC Okay. Give me a few minutes to collect some
 data, and we'll do that.
