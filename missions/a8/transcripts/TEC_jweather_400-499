03 02 52 02 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
03 02 52 07 CDR Roger. Go ahead.
03 02 52 09 CC Roger. Frank, we'd like to know about the water
 chlorination. Have you - when was the last time
 you chlorinated the water? Over.
03 02 52 16 CDR About an hour and a half ago; we've already done it.
03 02 52 22 CC Roger. We copy you an hour and a half ago.
 Affirmative?
03 02 52 28 CDR Roger. You know we wouldn't forget that.
03 02 52 36 CC Roger.
03 02 52 40 CDR Jim spilled a little, and it smelled like a
 bucket of Clorox about an hour ago.
03 02 52 51 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
03 02 52 57 CDR I said Jim inadvertently spilled some of that
 chlorine, and it smelled like a bucket of
 Clorox in here for a little while.
03 02 53 06 CC Roger. Understand.

03 02 58 52 CC Roger. We have two and a half minutes to LOS,
 and all systems are looking good. Everything is
 looking just fine down here, Frank.
03 02 59 02 CDR Thank you.
03 02 59 06 CC We'll have some more information on the TV on
 the next rev. We're not planning any big change
 in the time, just to extend them a little bit, I
 think, closer to the terminator.
03 02 59 21 CDR Just give us the time, will you, because we just
 want to know when it is. I'd like to get the
 terminator if we could, and we've got a little
 message, and that's it.
03 02 59 29 CC Roger. We'll do that the next time you come
 around.
03 02 59 32 CDR Thank you. Okay. And have the EECOM guys keep
 a sharp watch on our systems. Old Anders is so
 busy fooling around with these pictures that -
 not much else is getting done.
03 02 59 47 CC Roger. The EECOM is doing that.

03 03 50 36 CC Roger. We have been having a little antenna
 problem on the ground here. We are reading you
 now with a lot of noise in the background. How me?
03 03 50 46 CDR Loud and clear, Michael.
03 03 50 59 CC Roger. Frank, we are still trying to get a little
 bit better COMM here. Stand by; you're unreadable.
03 03 52 26 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
03 03 52 30 CDR Loud and clear, Houston. Apollo 8.
03 03 52 32 CC I understand you are reading us loud and clear;
 we are barely reading you. Would you go to P00 in
 ACCEPT, please? We are going to send you a P27 update.
03.03 52 45 CDR Roger. Going to P00 and to ACCEPT, Houston.
03 03 53 47 CDR We are in P00 and ACCEPT.
03 03 53 51 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You are not readable. We are
 going to delay the P27 until we get a little bit
 better lock on you.
03 03 54 11 CC As long as you're reading me okay, Frank, I'll
 bring you up to date on a couple of things. The
 P27 which we will be sending you is a state vector
 update going to the LM slot, and we'd like to -
 as per plan - to transfer that to the CSM slot by
 a VERB 47 ENTER, and we would like to just remind
 you that prior to doing your VERB 47 ENTER manually
 select P00 and wait for the computer activity light
 to go out. Did you copy? Over.

03 03 55 05 CC Alright. I'll go ahead with a map update when
 you're ready to copy.
03 03 55 17 CDR Okay. Can you hold off a minute?
03 03 56 17 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. How are you reading
 now?
03 03 56 34 CDR Go ahead, Houston. This is Apollo 8.
03 03 57 04 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston with a map update.
 Are you ready to copy?
03 03 57 12 CDR Just a minute, Mike.
03 03 57 20 CC Roger. Apollo 8, Houston. Your map update for

03 04 06 19 CC Reading you a lot better, Bill. How are you
 reading me?
03 04 06 25 LMP I'm reading you five - loud and clear, and you
 copying our low bit data to record these tracking
 passes? Over.
03 04 06 35 CC That is affirmative. We are getting low bit data
 now.
03 04 06 41 LMP okay. I've played - run the tape recorder back
 to the beginning. We have quite a bit of high
 bit, so all you'll have to do is start recording
 when you are ready.
03 04 06 55 CC Roger. Stand by one, Bill.
03 04 07 27 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Stand by one on the tape
 recorder dump. We would like you to look at your
 steam pressure. We think that the primary evaporator
 may have dried out, and if the steam pressure
 shows off-scale low, would you please close the
 back pressure valve and reservice the evaporator?
 Over.
03 04 07 50 CDR Roger.
03 04 08 49 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We are ready to send you the
 P27 LM state vector update when you are ready.

03 04 18 14 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Were you calling?
 Over.
03 04 18 19 LMP Roger. You can go ahead now and give you computer
 and get the updates, and let's get going on the
 PAD messages.
03 04 18 26 CC Roger.
03 04 18 36 LMP It is in P00 and ACCEPT.
03 04 18 44 LMP Okay, Houston. Are you ready to talk about the
 water boiler problem?
03 04 18 49 CC Roger. We copy you in P00 and ACCEPT, and we
 are sending you a P27 LM state vector. On the
 water boiler, it looks to us like the evaporator
 has been reserviced. How does it look to you?
 Over.
03 04 19 06 LMP Roger. I reserviced it, put it to AUTO - H<sub>2</sub>O
 flow to AUTO; and the steam pressure went to
 zero again. So I tried reservicing it the second
 time for 1 minute, and again no results. I'm in
 the present process of closing the back pressure
 valve manually. Over.
03 04 19 25 CC Roger. Understand you tried to reservice it twice,
 both times steam pressure has gone to zero, and
 now you are closing the back pressure valve manually.
03 04 19 36 LMP Roger. Each time I have reserviced it, the steam
 pressure came up to about 0.07 to 0.1; but as soon

Tape 51
Page 6
 as the steam and water were put to AUTO, the
 steam pressure went right back down again.
03 04 20 01 CC Roger. We copy, and we are reading you loud
 and clear now, Bill. On your map update, did
 you copy that that I gave you previously?
03 04 20 13 CMP Negative. We have not copied it yet.
03 04 20 14 LMP Negative.
03 04 20 17 CC Okay. I have it for you again when you are
 ready to copy.
03 04 20 24 CMP Ready to copy.
03 04 20 26 CC This is a map update for REV's 4/5: LOS 76:59:59,

 got a good P27 update.
03 04 22 04 CDR Okay. We will go to P00 and TRANSFER.
03 04 22 07 CC Roger.
03 04 22 45 CDR Houston, do you have a TEI 5 for us?
03 04 22 48 CC We are working on it now, Frank. Have it for you
 momentarily.

03 04 22 56 CDR Roger.
03 04 23 27 CC Apollo 8. Houston.
03 04 23 32 LMP Go.
03 04 23 33 CC Roger. On your back pressure valve, we would like
 to know how long after you closed the back pressure
 valve the first time - how long it was from the time
 you closed it until the time you started the reservicing?
 We would like for you to wait about 15 minutes
 to prevent any ice from forming due to flash freezing.
 Over.
03 04 23 59 LMP Okay. I started immediately to reservice it.
03 04 24 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We show that you closed it this
 last time about 4 minutes ago, so we would like you
 to wait another 15 minutes and then try to reservice
 it again at that time and then go to AUTO. Over.
03 04 24 41 LMP Roger.
03 04 24 43 CC Roger. Thank you. The TEI 4 PAD which you have
 is still valid. We will have a TEI 5 PAD for you
 shortly.
03 04 24 55 LMP Roger. Be advised we are presently in steam pressure
 MANUAL, and we're in H<sub>2</sub>O flow AUTO, and are now in
 H<sub>2</sub>O flow OFF, as of about 5 seconds ago.
03 04 25 15 CC Roger. We copy that, Bill. And we confirm that's a
 good configuration.
03 04 25 28 LMP Right now, I've got the H<sub>2</sub> flow OFF. Do we stay
 that way?

Tape 51
Page 8
03 04 25 32 CC Affirmative.
03 04 25 45 CC Apollo 8, Houston. On your television update,
 we propose that you start the TV at the flight
 plan time of 85 hours 37 minutes and simply
 extend the stop time a few minutes. You're
 currently scheduled to stop at 86 hours, and we
 would like to keep it going until the terminator,
 which should be approximately 86:14. Over.
03 04 26 11 CDR Roger.
03 04 26 27 CC Frank, I know you are busy up there. We've got
 the daily news for you whenever and if ever you'd
 like to hear it. ..
03 04 26 38 CDR I'll give you a call.
03 04 27 46 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston.
03 04 27 51 CDR Go ahead.
03 04 27 53 CC I have the TEI 5 PAD for you whenever you are
 ready to copy.
03 04 28 05 CDR Okay. Go ahead.
03 04 28 07 CC Okay. TEI 5, SPS/G&N: 47 correction - 45701, minus
 043, plus 116 079:21:26.03. Are you with me so far?
03 04 28 41 CDR Roger.

 to using four quads for 15 seconds?
03 04 32 23 CC No objection to four-quad ullage, Apollo 8.
03 04 32 28 CDR Okay. We'd like to just go ahead and use four
 quads all times, unless we get a lot shorter
 on fuel than we are now.
03 04 32 34 CC Understand.
03 04 32 39 CDR And is that 15 seconds?
03 04 32 42 CC Affirmative: 15 seconds, four quads.
03 04 32 49 CC Apollo 8 - -
03 04 32 50 CDR Thank you, and horizon is 4 degrees at minus - -
03 04 32 54 CC That readback is correct, Frank, and we'd like
 to advise that the voice quality on that high

03 04 33 04 CDR Thank you. Mike, it's four quads for 15 seconds.
 Is that right?
03 04 33 12 CC That is affirmative, Apollo 8: four quads for
 15 seconds.
03 04 33 18 CDR Thank you.
03 04 33 45 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 04 33 50 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
03 04 33 53 CC Roger for Bill. He can go ahead and do his
 standard reservice on the water now. It's
 looking good.
03 04 36 05 CDR Okay. You want us to reservice it now?
03 04 36 07 CC That's affirmative, and upon completion, go
 back to AUTO.
03 04 36 19 LMP Roger.
03 04 40 21 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 04 40 27 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
03 04 40 28 CC Roger. We are still dumping your tapes. The
 voice quality on high bit is coming through
 superb, and you are GO for the next rev. And
 we would like to get a brief status report on
 your rest between 60 hours and LOI 1, just to
 fill in some information for us.
03 04 40 56 CDR We only got a couple hours rest.
03 04 40 58 CC Okay.
03 04 41 06 CDR We're tired right now, but we will have to wait
 until TEI before we get back to the regular cycle.

Tape 52
Page 3
03 04 41 12 CC Alright. I suspect you're right.
03 04 41 17 LMP Okay, Houston. The water boiler has been reserviced,
 back pressure valve CLOSED for 1 minute, 
 water ON for 2, and it's now steam pressure
 AUTO, H<sub>2</sub>O flow AUTO.
03 04 41 30 CC Roger. We copy, Bill.
03 04 41 56 LMP If we have a problem, a similar problem, again
 on the back side in the sunlight, might be a
 good idea to crank the secondary loop until
 we have AOS. What do you think about that?
03 04 42 11 CC Stand by one, Bill.
03 04 43 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 04 43 23 CMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
03 04 43 25 CC Roger, Jim. In regard to your evaporator, we
 feel that if you do have a similar problem
 next time on the back side in sunlight, check
 the evaporator outlet temperature, and if it
 gets above 60, we concur that it would be a
 good idea to bring up the secondary loop. Over.
03 04 43 47 CMP Roger.
03 04 44 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston. When we say bring up the
 secondary loop, we mean bring up the evaporator
 only on the secondary loop. Copy?
03 04 44 28 CDR Roger.
03 04 44 29 CMP Roger.

03 04 49 51 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. We got time for a little
 news?
03 04 49 56 CC Apollo 3, this is Houston. Over.
03 04 50 02 LMP I say how about a little bit of that news you
 promised?
03 04 50 05 CC Roger. We got the Interstellar Times here, the
 December 24 edition. Your TV program was a big
 success. It was viewed this morning by most of
 the nations of your neighboring planet; the earth.
 It was carried live all over Europe, including
 even Moscow and East Berlin, also in Japan and
 all of North and Central America and parts of
 South America. We don't know yet how extensive
 the coverage was in Africa. Are you copying me
 all right? Over.
03 04 50 38 CDR You are loud and clear.
03 04 50 38 CC Good. San Diego welcomed home today the Pueblo
 crew in a big ceremony. They had a pretty rough
 time of it in the Korean prison. Christmas
 cease-fire is in effect in Viet Nam, with only
 sporadic outbreaks of fighting. And if you
 haven't done your Christmas shopping by now,
 you better forget it.
03 04 51 02 LMP Thank you.
03 04 51 04 CC A couple of Oilers made the All-Star team,
 Webster and Farr.

Tape 52
Page 5
03 04 51 14 LMP Roger.
03 04 51 22 CC And that's about all our news. How about your
 news?
03 04 51 28 CDR Well, we'll be looking forward to a big burn
 here shortly.
03 04 51 34 CC Roger.
03 04 51 39 CMP Mike, I think I can say it without contradiction,
 it's been a mighty long dry spell up here.
03 04 51 48 CC I guess you can say anything you like without
 contradiction.
03 04 51 56 CDR When can we dump water, Houston?
03 04 52 00 CC Say again, Frank.
03 04 52 04 CDR When can we dump water?
03 04 52 06 CC Stand by.
03 04 53 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 04 53 38 CDR Go, Houston.
03 04 53 39 CC We will get you the number after a while on your
 water dump. It looks like the quantity isn't
 increasing very slightly, and we're considering
 not only the quantity in regard to the dump,
 but also its effects on the trajectory relative
 to TEI and so forth, but we will have a good
 answer for you shortly.
03 04 54 00 CDR We are not just thinking about the waste water
 tank: we're thinking about some other kind of

Tape 52
Page 6
 water that has to get dumped out of the spacecraft,
 slightly used water.
03 04 54 11 CC Roger. We understand.
03 04 56 30 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 04 56 35 CDR Go ahead.
03 04 56 36 CC Roger. We have about three and a half minutes
 to LOS. We give you back the DSE under your
 control, and in regard to your water dump, we
 are tentatively predicting a waste water tank
 dump at about 80 hours GET and any other dumps
 are at your discretion, any time you would like
 to make them.
03 04 57 00 CDR Thank you.
03 04 57 08 CC People listening to the high bit rate down here
 say it's like sitting in your living room listening
 to good hi-fi.
03 04 57 21 CDR Sounds like a good idea.
03 04 58 03 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Coming up on 2 minutes to
 LOS. We got a good reservice on the primary
 evaporator, and everything is still looking
 very good down here.
03 04 58 16 CDR Okay. Thank you.
03 04 59 12 CC Apollo 8, Houston. One minute to LOS. Are you
 still reading us loud and clear?
03 04 59 18 CDR Loud and clear. Loud and clear.

Tape 52
Page 7
03 04 59 20 CC Okay, fine. We've been noticing a little bit
 of increase in our background noise as you
 approach backside.
03 04 59 30 CDR Roger. We had to go off the high gain. That's
 why.
03 04 59 35 CC Roger.
03 04 59 44 CC Have a good backside; we'll see you next time
 around.
03 04 59 49 CDR Okay, Mike.

03 05 46 48 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
03 05 47 05 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Go ahead.
03 05 47 07 CC Roger. Read you loud and clear. Welcome back.
03 05 47 13 LMP Roger. Looks like the evaporator - looks like
 the evaporator is holding okay, or at least it
 is trying to. It dropped the temperature down
 to about 32, and now it's come back up again
 and stabilized at about 42 degrees.
03 05 47 31 CC Roger. Copy you, Bill.
03 05 48 41 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
03 05 48 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 05 48 50 CMP Roger. Houston, this is Apollo 8. What we are
 doing on the control point tracking - I managed
 to look for a CP-1 at the same time we were trying
 to do a CP-2 on this rev. I picked up two

Tape 52
Page 8
 marks which are just as small, but more easily
 recognizable, than the ones that were given to
 me. I know that I can repeat the process and
 pick the same small point on the next rev. Now
 I can try to look for the control points that
 are written down, but I think that I have better
 control over the ones that we have.
03 05 49 29 CC Roger, Jim. Understand. We'll check that for
 you.
03 05 49 34 CMP Roger. One more point: the control point times
 which you have given me are a little bit off,
 and I can notice by comparing these maps that
 these maps are not too well aligned either.
03 05 49 47 CC Roger. These two small points that you can
 repeat your marks on: will you be able to
 identify those precisely on a map? Over.
03 05 50 00 CMP That's affirmative; that is why I picked them.
 They are both - they're both very prominent
 features, and they are both very small craters
 about the same size as the ones we are looking
 for, but I can pinpoint them on a map.
03 05 50 13 CC Roger.
03 05 50 48 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
03 05 50 49 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
03 05 50 54 CMP Roger. One more comment: as it offered a
 lot of controversy at data priority meetings,

Tape 52
Page 9
 it looks like 10 degrees pitch up is the best
 attitude to obtain the horizon so that you can
 follow the landmark down through the scanning
 telescope. If you pitch down any more, full
 up trunnion will not get the horizon, and the
 horizon is a great help in leading yourself
 into the control point.
03 05 51 28 CC Roger. Understand.
03 05 52 40 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 05 52 45 CMP Go ahead.
03 05 52 47 CC Jim, we concur with your use of the two small
 craters which you can repeatedly mark on and
 find on the map; and also if you will give us
 your new latitudes and longitudes, we can compute
 for you a time of closest approach to those
 points with the spacecraft 10 degrees pitched-up.
 Over.
03 05 53 12 CMP Roger, Houston. CP-1 latitude minus 606269,
 longitude over 2, minus 78954, altitude plus
 00152; for CP-2 latitude minus 09638, longitude
 over 2, plus 81691, altitude minus 00007. I
 tried to get CP-3 at the same pass, but I let
 it go by to get set up for this first track at
 the landing site.

Tape 52
Page 10
03 05 54 05 CC Roger, Houston. CP-1: would you say again the
 latitude, and on CP-2, say again the longitude
 CP-2, please?
03 05 54 15 CMP Roger. CP-1 latitude minus 06269; that is the
 latitude; and for longitude over 2 for CP-2,
 plus 81691.
03 05 54 34 CC Okay. We copied them. Thank you.
03 05 54 43 CMP And it appears that resolve medium is a very
 good combination to track.
03 05 54 53 CC Roger. I understand. Resolve medium.
03 05 54 59 CMP And it appears so far, Houston, that no spacecraft
 pitch motion is required to get five marks
 on the target in plenty of time.
03 05 55 10 CC Roger. I understand you require no spacecraft
 motion to get five marks.

03 06 04 20 CMP Go ahead.
03 06 04 21 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
03 06 04 23 CC Roger. I am about 15 minutes early with the TEI
 fix update and the map update. I will have them
 here whenever it's convenient for you to copy.
03 06 04 36 LMP Okay. Just a little bit, Mike.
03 06 13 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 06 13 35 CMP Go ahead.
03 06 13 37 CC Roger. We would like to ask you to stop using
 AUTO OPTICS on the pseudo landing site. It's
 necessary that we send you up a P27 to update
 the RLS values stored in the computer. Over.
03 06 13 54 CMP Roger. I found ... I went to MANUAL OPTICS on B-1.
03 06 14 01 CC Roger. Understand.
03 06 16 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
03 06 16 49 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
03 06 16 51 CC Roger. If you.would go to P00 and ACCEPT, please,
 we are going to send you a P27 load which will update
 an RLS value which will be followed by a procedural
 change, Jim, we will give you later; and
 AUTO OPTICS should be working shortly.
03 06 17 12 CMP Roger. Or I could use no landmark AUTO OPTICS instead
 of the code.
03 06 17 31 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We are also sending you up a
 state vector update at the same time.

Tape 53
Page 2
03 06 17 39 CMP Okay. We will be expecting that.
03 06 18 14 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're taking the DSE for a
 dump. Over.
03 06 18 31 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
03 06 18 36 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
03 06 18 38 CC Roger. We would like to take Bill's DSE for a
 dump. Over.
03 06 18 44 CMP Roger. Go ahead.
03 06 18 46 CC Thank you.
03 06 24 33 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. We're ready for the - your
 updates, your PAD's.
03 06 24 38 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. I have updates, a
 map update for REV 5/6, and TEI 6 update.
 Which would you like first?
03 06 24 51 LMP okay. I've got the map update page now. Why
 don't you give me that one?
03 06 24 55 CC Okay. Map update for REV 5/6. LOS 78:58:49,
 sunrise 79:08:07, prime meridian 79:14:30, AOS
 79:44:36, sunset 80:21:05; IP-1, time of closest
 approach to target B-1 80:09:00. Now your two
 new control points that Jim gave us: control
 point number 1, acquisition 79:10:32, control
 point number 2, acquisition 79:23:14. Over.
03 06 26 16 LMP Roger. Copy. Ready for the TEI.
03 06 26 26 CC Okay, Bill. Before we read the big TEI update
 here, I'd like to give Jim briefly a procedure

Tape 53
Page 3
 for P22. When he comes to NOUN 89, we request
 that he do a VERB 34 ENTER. Do not proceed, and
 by so doing then, he will not incorporate the
 lat and longitude from his mark, and he will not
 change the reference value of the landing site,
 and we will solve this AUTO OPTICS problem. Over.
03 06 27 08 LMP Let me see if I have this correct, Mike. When
 flashing 0689 comes up with the latitude and
 longitude information, I will not proceed but
 will go to VERB 34 and terminate. Is that correct?
03 06 27 24 CC Yes, that is affirmative. Do a VERB 34 ENTER
 instead of a PROCEED. And that will -
03 06 27 34 CMP Alright. Is this technique true -
03 06 27 45 CMP Houston, is this technique true for both the
 node control point AUTO OPTICS on P25?
03 06 27 52 CC Stand by one, Jim.
03 06 27 54 CMP And the LM ...
03 06 28 09 CC That is affirmative, Apollo 8. That is always
 true.
03 06 28 16 CMP Okay. Roger. True for the code AUTO OPTICS and
 no landmark. I'll proceed instead of going on - 
 or I'll use 34 instead proceeding on 89.

03 06 28 25 CC Roger. Thank you, Jim, and I have the TEI 6 hour
when you are ready - or TEI number 6.
03 06 28 45 CDR Go ahead.

Tape 53
Page 4
03 06 28 52 LMP Ready to copy.
03 06 28 54 CC Roger. I'm glad you are ready to copy TEI number
 6. I've got one last comment for Jim before
 you do so. The VERB 89 - or correction - the
 NOUN 89 we are talking about is the one that he
 gets after marking. There are two NOUN 89's, one
 prior to marking and one after, and our procedure
 references NOUN 89 after marking. Over.
03 06 29 21 CMP Roger. Understand.
03 06 29 24 CC Thank you, and, Bill, you still ready to copy?
03 06 29 29 LMP Ready to copy, Mike.
03 06 29 31 CC TEI 6, SPS/G&N: 45701, minus 040, plus 157. Are

03 06 34 39 LMP Roger. Got it, 081.
03 06 34 42 CC Thank you, sir.
03 06 34 46 LMP Thank you, Michael. As a matter of interest,
 these side windows are so hazy that when the sun
 shines on them, they just about - they are real
 poor for any visual observation or photography - 
 heads-up.
03 06 35 04 CC Roger. Understand.
03 06 36 33 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
03 06 36 36 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
03 06 36 37 CC Roger. The last state vector updates we sent you,
 Jim, was to the LM slots, and you will have to
 transfer that over to the CSM slots using VERB 47
 ENTER. Over.
03 06 36 52 CMP Roger. Will do.
03 06 36 54 CC Thank you.
03 06 38 16 CC Apollo 8, Houston.

03 06 38 21 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
03 06 38 23 CC Roger. Bill has got his tape recorder back, and
 we noticed during that last dump, it was all in
 low bit rate. We wonder whether that was intentional
 or not? Over.
03 06 38 42 LMP Roger. We didn't have much to say; we couldn't
 see out of the windows very well, Mike.
03 06 38 47 CC Roger. Understand.
03 06 38 53 LMP It was really too bad.
03 06 40 31 CC Apollo 8, Houston. - -
03 06 40 38 LMP Go ahead - -
03 06 40 39 CC Roger, Bill. This next time around into the sunlight,
 we do not expect any problem with the primary
 evaporator. If it does start drying out, we
 think it is best just to close the back pressure
 valve, and there is no need to activate the secondary
 boiler. Over.
03 06 41 02 LMP Okay. I guess the 6O-degree limit will still hold
 then.
03 06 41 12 CC Stand by.
03 06 41 40 CC Apollo 3, Houston. We are suggesting you disregard
 the 60 degree limit, and let it go ahead and
 rise up above 60. There is no need to activate
 the secondary. Over.
03 06 41 54 LMP Okay. We just don't want to boil our IMU.
03 06 41 57 CC Roger. Understand then. Apollo 8, you are GO for
 the next lunar orbit REV.

03 06 54 08 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
03 06 54 13 CMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 - -
03 06 54 16 CC Roger. We have about 4-1/2 minutes left before
 we have LOS; we'd like your last PRD readout.
 Over.
03 06 54 29 CMP Stand by. The commander is asleep; we'll get
 his when he wakes up. The LMP is still 6 ...
 0.64, C is 9, CMP is 0.09.
03 06 55 07 CC Roger. copy 0.64, 0.09. Thank you.
03 06 58 04 CC Apollo 8, Houston. About 40 seconds to LOS,
 and everything's looking good down here.
03 06 58 14 CMP Roger. Houston. We will give it another try
 here.

03 07 52 05 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
03 07 52 07 CC Reading you very weak but - a lot of background
 noise. Welcome back around. How are you reading us?
03 07 52 18 LMP Reading you fine.
03 07 52 20 CC Okay.
03 07 55 43 CMP Houston, Apollo 6.
03 07 55 45 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
03 07 55 51 CMP Roger, Houston. A few words on our optics tracking
 system. I used AUTO OPTICS for control points 1 and
 2 on the backside, and they worked beautifully,
 tracked both the targets for me. And I went to the
 control point 3 as designated in our orbital control
 book to see the latitude and longitude that was given
 to me and used AUTO OPTICS to track that particular
 coordinate system, and it was very close to the actual
 tracking plot. I picked the mark there where
 I did a final marking and recorded latitude and longitude.
 I'm now about to come up on the landing site
 and using AUTO OPTICS in the coded input to see how
 that works.

Tape 54

03 07 56 57 CC Roger, Apollo 8.
03 07 59 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 07 59 34 LMP Go ahead.
03 07 59 35 CC Roger. We know you're busy so we are not going
 to bother you. We are watching your progress
 on the DSKY. You are looking good; all your
 systems are looking good, and we have maneuver
 PAD's for you any time at your convenience.
03 07 59 52 LMP Roger. We will take them when we are doing the
 P52, if that's okay.
03 07 59 56 CC That is just fine.
03 08 56 CMP Mike, Apollo 8.
03 08 07 58 CC Apollo 8, go ahead.
03 08 08 03 CMP Mike, there are an awful lot of objects down on
 the landing site. It would just warm up Jack
 Schmidt's heart. The AUTO OPTICS are tracking
 perfectly on the target, and the two high peaks
 stand out beautifully. I have a beautiful view
 of it. The first I've seen just barely beneath
 the vertical now, and the second one coming up -
 It's just a grand view!
03 08 08 28 CC Roger, Jim. Glad to hear it. Jack's listening.
03 08 09 45 LMP Jack, the information - The triangles that we see
 now are from the first IP, second IP, and the B-1
 are just right, I think, for landing conditions.
 The shadows aren't too deep for you to get confused.

Tape 54
Page 3
 but the land has texture to it, and there are
 enough shadows there to make everything stand out.
03 08 10 01 LMP If Jack's listening, tell him that the optical may
 be doing all right, but the eyeball is having a
 little trouble looking through all this smear on
 the windows.
03 08 10 25 CC Roger. Understand the optics are doing better than
 the eyeballs. How about the cameras?
03 08 10 33 LMP We always have the same smear to look through. The
 rendezvous windows are okay, but they're so small
 and looking in the wrong directions here so far.
03 08 10 42 CC Roger.
03 08 10 43 LMP I think the vertical stereo will be okay.
03 08 11 10 LMP It certainly looks like we're picking the more interesting
 places on the moon to land in. The backside
 looks like a sand pile my kids have been
 playing in for a long time. It's all beat up, no
 definition. Just a lot of bumps and holes.
03 08 11 27 CMP I'm looking at 2P-2 right now, Houston, and it's
 a great spot.
03 08 11 33 LMP The area we're over right now gives some hint of
 possible volcanic, though I really can't eyeball
 it at the moment to pin that down. There are some
 craters and buildups that just definitely suggest
 volcanic activity.
03 08 11 52 CC Roger. Understand, Bill, and understand Jim thinks
 the old 2P-2 is a winner.

Tape 54
Page 4
03 08 12 06 LMP Yes, that backside doesn't look good at all.
03 08 12 10 CC Roger.
03 08 12 15 LMP That's relatively speaking, of course.
03 08 12 18 CC Of course.
03 08 18 52 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 08 18 53 CMP This is Apollo 8.
03 08 18 56 CC Roger, Jim. We have you on the high-gain antenna.
 We'd like you to take the DSE and dump it over.
03 08 19 05 CMP Roger, Houston. Are you going to use our computer
 to update our state vector?
03 08 19 34 CC That's affirmative, Jim. We'd like to - stand by
 one, and I'll tell you when to go to P00 and ACCEPT.
03 08 19 45 CMP Roger. Then I'll work my 52 around your ...
03 08 20 05 CC Jim, would you please go to P00 in ACCEPT, and
 we'll send you a P27 and run a state vector update.
03 08 20 12 CMP Roger. You have P00 in ACCEPT.
03 08 20 16 CC Thank you.
03 08 20 36 CMP Houston, this is Apollo 8. We have a little piece
 of useful information if you're interested in deliberating over it.
03 08 20 46 CC Go ahead. Say again.
03 08 20 51 CMP Roger. Our first control point is very near the
 terminator, and as the optics were tracking it, I
 had occasion to watch the sun come up. And at
 about 2 minutes before sunrise, you get - the limb
 begins to brighten up into sort of a fine white

Tape 54
Page 5
 haze, a fine glow completely over
 the space just behind the limb.
03 08 21 23 CC Roger. I understand. About 2 minutes before the
 sun comes up, you get a fine white haze radiating
 out from behind the limb. How far out does it extend?
03 08 21 34 CMP It goes up quite a ways. It takes a fan shape,
 unlike the sunrise on earth where the atmosphere
 affects it. This just sort of is a complete haze
 all over the local area. It's concentrated at the
 exact spot where the sun comes up at ignition and
 then goes away from the sun spots. Very interesting.
03 08 21 54 CC Thank you, Jim. Thank you.
03 08 22 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're standing by with your map
 and TEI 7 updates.
03 08 22 48 CMP Stand by.
03 08 22 54 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You can go back to BLOCK with
 your computer.
03 08 23 02 CMP Roger.
03 08 23 31 LMP Okay, Mike. We're ready for the map update and
 then the TEI.
03 08 23 38 CC Okay. When you get your - before you get your map
 book out, the Houston COMM TECHS have got a little
 word for an old ex-CAP COMM. They say they consider
 you in NONREMOTE. Over.
03 08 23 54 LMP Not permanently, I hope.

Tape 54
Page 6
03 08 23 59 CC Okay. Your map update for REV 6/7: LOS 80:57:24,
 sunrise 81:06:57, prime meridian 81:13:02. Are
 you with me?
03 08 24 29 LMP You cut out after the prime meridian. I got it,
 but not AOS.
03 08 24 33 CC AOS 81:43:05, sunset 82:13:54. Remarks: IP-1
 TCA for B-1 82:07:39, and now I've got four more
 times for you which - acquisition times for when
 various things come over the horizon. Over.
03 08 25-09 LMP Roger. Go ahead.
03 08 25 12 CC Okay. Control point 1, acquisition time 81:09:05;
 control point 2, acquisition time 81:21:48; control
 point 3, acquisition time 81:43:17. B-1 acquisition
 time 82:03:54. And I say again all those ACQ times
 are when they first come over the horizon. Over.
03 08 25 54 LMP Roger. Copy, Houston. In about 2 seconds, I'll
 be ready for the TEI.
03 08 26 01 CC Alright.
03 08 26 13 LMP I'm ready.
03 08 26 16 CC TEI 7, SPS/G&N - stand by one, Bill.
03 08 26 55 LMP Just a matter of general interest, Houston: everybody
 is feeling good, and the CDR is taking a
 snooze.
03 08 27 01 CC Roger. Glad to hear it. We were just talking about
 a water dump down here. We've got one coming up,
 and it looks like on this REV prior to the time

Tape 54
Page 7
 around LOS or just prior to LOS, would be a convenient
 time to do it. Do you concur?
03 08 27 20 LMP Okay. We will. Down to 25 percent again?
03 08 27 24 CC That's affirmative, and we'd also be interested
 in any comments about what these various dumps
 have done to your optics, if anything, and how
 long the effects last after a dump.
03 08 27 38 LMP Don't seem to have done anything to the optics,
 but they've definitely got in some of the windows.
 There are a few little chunks of ice
 on window number 1, which is nearest the vent,
 and also on window number 5 a little bit; windows
 2 and 4 remain amazingly clear.
03 08 28 11 CC Roger. Thank you, Bill, and I'm ready to resume
 the PAD when you are.
03 08 28 19 LMP Okay. Press on with the weight.
03 08 28 22 CC Alright. Weight 45701, minus 040, plus 157 083
 18 2080, plus 32346, minus 01168, plus 05730. Are
 you with me so far? Over.
03 08 29 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
03 08 29 33 LMP Go ahead, Mike.
03 08 29 35 CC Roger. I got down through DELTA-V, minus X,
 minus Y, and minus Z. Did you copy those? Over.
03 08 29 44 LMP No, I didn't read a word. I'm still waiting for
 the weight.
03 08 29 49 CC Roger. Let's go back to the weight: 45701,
 minus 040, plus 157. Are you with me? Over.

03 08 41 13 CMP Are you receiving our tracking data?
03 08 41 24 CC That's affirmative, Jim. We are receiving.
03 08 41 29 CMP Okay. Thank you.
03 08 41 33 CC And also, Jim, we are - That last P27 we sent
 was for the LM state vector only, and it will
 require a VERB 47 ENTER to transfer to the CSM
 slot. Over.
03 08 41 48 CMP Roger. Will do.
03 08 41 49 CC Thank you.
03 08 45 39 LMP Okay. We're dumping the waste tank now, Houston.
03 08 45 44 CC Roger, Bill.
03 08 52 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
03 08 53 02 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
03 08 53 04 CC Roger. We've got 4 minutes til LOS, and everything
 is looking good down here.
03 08 53 13 LMP Roger. How much longer do you think we have to go
 into battery charge there, Mike?
03 08 53 19 CC I'll find out for you.
03 08 53 26 LMP If you can wake up the EECOM, why don't you
 have him ask the back room?

Tape 54

03 09 44 49 CC Roger, Frank. Good morning. You're loud and
 clear, how me?
03 09 44 54 CDR Loud and clear.
03 09 44 58 CC Welcome back.
03 09 45 04 CDR Thank you.
03 09 46 51 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
03 09 46 58 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
03 09 46 59 CC Roger. We have a request that Jim space his
 marks, his five marks out a bit more slowly.
 If possible, we would like to get a couple of
 them past the zenith. We're getting five of
 them with rather rapid spacing, and from the
 geometry viewpoint, it would be better if you'd
 slow them down a little bit and lengthened them
 out so as to include a couple of them past the
 zenith. Over.
03 09 47 29 CDR Roger. We understand.
03 09 47 39 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. That last set of marks
 are invalid. Disregard what Jim drew the last
 time.
03 09 47 48 CC Roger. Understand the last set of marks are
 invalid. Over.

Tape 55

03 09 47 54 CMP Roger. If you would correlate ... the last
 set.
03 09 48 03 CC We have an awful lot of background noise, Jim.
 Could you say again, please?
03 09 48 12 CMP Roger. I'm coming up on control point 3. I
 tried to stick another control point in between
 2 and 3. It didn't do it, so I just took out
 our program, marked it down on the program.
03 09 48 25 CC Roger. Understand you are coming up on 3.
03 09 52 03 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 09 52 07 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
03 09 52 09 CC Roger. On Jim's marks, we'd like to get spacing
 of approximately 30, 30 seconds between each
 mark. The last ones we are copying roughly
 15 seconds between marks, and we would like to
 stretch it out even further if that is okay with
 you.
03 09 52 31 CDR Alright.
03 10 02 18 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
03 10 02 22 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
03 10 02 27 CMP Roger, Mike. I find that tracking is much easier
 using the sextant than the scanning telescope.
 You have finer control, and at these orbital
 speeds, resolved to medium seem to be the best
 combination.

Tape 55
Page 3
03 10 02 46 CC Roger, Jim. I copy that it's easier for you to
 use the sextant than the scanning telescope. It
 gives you finer control, and say again after that.
03 10 03 05 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Do you read?
03 10 03 09 CMP Roger. Did you copy?
03 10 03 12 CC Roger. I copy that it's - tracking is easier
 using the sextant than the scanning telescope;
 it gives you finer control, and say again after
 that. Over.
03 10 03 26 CMP And the combination of resolved and medium is
 perhaps the best combination of - combination
 of - speed low is too low; we can't catch up with
 the target.
03 10 03 39 CC Roger. Understand that the best combination is
 resolved and medium. Low is just too low.
03 10 03 49 CMP Roger.
03 10 13 33 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
03 10 13 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
03 10 13 41 CMP Roger. I'm not too sure what happened that time,
 Mike. I was marking on the landing sites, using
 the code, and I kept getting a large trunnion
 for AUTO OPTICS. And I could see the target, or
 landing site was coming up, so I just went manually
 and marked and got the - the latitude and longitude
 were quite different from the nominal.
03 10 14 14 CC Roger. We copy that, Jim.

 P22; and in the meantime, I have your maneuver
 PAD's and map updates, at your convenience. Over.
03 10 17 41 CDR Roger.
03 10 18 12 CMP Go ahead with your data, Mike.
03 10 18 14 CC okay. And before that, we'd like to take the DSE
 away from you, please, for a while.
03 10 18 28 CMP All yours.
03 10 18 30 CC Thank you, and we'd like you to go to P00 and
 ACCEPT. We have a P27 state vector update for
 you.
03 10 18 42 CMP There's P00, and I'm going to ACCEPT.
03 10 18 46 CC Thank you.
03 10 18 48 CMP All yours.
03 10 18 55 CC Which would you like first, the map update or
 the TEI 8?
03 10 19 02 CMP The map would be fine.
03 10 19 07 CC Okay. Map update: LOS 82:55:54, sunrise 83:05:49,

03 10 25 42 CDR Thank you.
03 10 26 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 10 26 50 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
03 10 26 52 CC Roger. Some time back, we noted evidence of a
 restart in the computer and wondered if you had
 any remarks about it. Over.
03 10 27 00 CDR I know it. Jim got screwed up on one of those
 programs. He's getting kind of tired here, and
 we got a RESTART and a couple of PROGRAM ALARMS.
 I don't know what he did.
03 10 27 12 CC Roger, Frank. The main point is the computer
 is looking fine to us, now.
03 10 27 20 CDR That's good.
03 10 27 23 CMP Houston, don't believe all you hear up here.
03 10 27 28 CC No, we have a filter, Jim, for that.
03 10 27 34 CDR Thank you.

Tape 55

03 10 28 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 10 28 37 CDR
03 10 28 39 CC Roger. In some of Jim's previous comments about
 the limb brightness as the sun was about to come
 up has sparked a lot of interest down here. And
 we'd like to ask him if he gets a chance to notice
 again or perhaps he can recall, whether there were any
 changes in the appearance of the stars. Such as,
 did he notice any twinkling while this was taking
 place, and did he notice any narrow limb brightening
 within 10 to 20 seconds prior to the sun's rising?
 Over.
03 10 29 14 LMP He'll be with you - he's doing a P52 now.
03 10 29 17 CC Okay.
03 10 30 08 CMP Houston, my comments concerning the sunrise was
 the comments above the terrain. There appeared
 what might be called diagonal light or light due
 to the haze or something like that. As the sun
 came above or before the sun came above the limb,
 definite rays could be seen coming from the other
 side. It was a uniform haze emanating from the
 center spot where the sun was going to rise, and
 this was something which I didn't expect.
03 10 30 42 CC Roger, Jim. Understand. We copied that and just
 curious, and if you see it again whether you notice
 any stars twinkling or any additional information.

Tape 55
Page 8
03 10 30 55 CMP Will do. Won't have a chance until control point 1.
03 10 31 06 LMP Actually, he doesn't want to pass out too much of
 that information. He wants to save it and write
 a paper when he gets back, Mike.
03 10 31 12 CC Right. In German, probably, huh?
03 10 35 57 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
03 10 35 59 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 10 36 04 CDR Okay. What time is that TV, Mike, 85:37?
03 10 36 08 CC 85:37 to terminator, which is probably like 86:14.
03 10 36 20 CDR okay. Well, I don't know if we can go that long
 with it, and I'm going to scrub all the other
 experiments, the converging stereo or other
 photography, and we are a little bit tired; I
 want to use that last bit to really make sure we're
 right for TEI.
03 10 36 38 CC Roger, I understand, Frank.
03 10 36 42 CC A couple of miscellaneous items for you: we'd
 like for you to discontinue charging battery B at
 this time; we'd also like to get a cryo stir,
 2 minutes on all four; and your UP TELEMETRY IU
 switch, put to BLOCK, please, and you are GO for
 the next lunar orbit.
03 10 37 08 CDR Thank you.
03 10 37 10 CC Roger.
03 10 40 10 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
03 10 40 14 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead, Frank.

Tape 55

03 10 40 18 CDR Roger. I want to scrub these control
 point sightings on this next REV, too, and let Jim
 take a rest.
03 10 40 25 CC Roger. I understand.
03 10 40 30 CC I understand you want to scrub control points 1,
 2, and 3 on the next REV and the converging
 stereo on the following REV.
03 10 40 42 CDR That's right. We're getting too tired.
03 10 40 44 CC Okay, Frank.
03 10 41 39 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 10 41 41 CDR Go ahead.
03 10 41 44 CC This REV coming up we would like to clarify
 whether you intend to scrub control points 1, 2,
 and 3, only, and do the pseudo landing site; or
 whether you also intend to scrub the pseudo landing
 site marks. Over.
03 10 42 01 CDR We're scrubbing everything. I'll stay up and try
 and keep the spacecraft vertical and take some
 automatic pictures, but I want Jim and Bill to
 get some rest.
03 10 42 10 CC Roger. Understand.

03 11 53 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 11 53 49 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
03 11 53 51 CC Roger, Apollo 8. Couple of notes for you: on
 the P52 you are coming up to on this REV, we've
 looked at your state vectors and all your information.
 The platform looks good, and it appears

Tape 56
Page 2
 that it is your option if you would like to
 by-pass this P52, your platform will still be
 good at the following TEI pass. And we would
 like to have your PRD reading, and I guess we
 are behind the sleep summary. Over.
03 11 54 28 CDR Okay. Jim and Bill are both resting now. I
 had about 3 or 4 hours earlier today.
03 11 54 41 CC Roger. COPY.
03 11 54 47 CDR This PRD now reads 144.
03 11 54 50 CC copy, 144. And we have an update ready to go
 into your computer for the state vector if
 you want to go to P00 and ACCEPT.
03 11 55 07 CDR P00 and ACCEPT.
03 11 55 09 CC Thank you.
03 11 59 52 CDR Jerry, I'm standing by to copy the TEI 9 PAD.
03 12 00 14 CC Okay, Apollo 8. We have completed with the
 computer. You can use the VERB 47 to transfer,
 and I have the TEI 9 PAD.
03 12 00 26 CDR That's Ken isn't it? Just a minute, and I'll
 take care of it.
03 12 00 30 CC Roger.
03 12 01 08 CMP Okay. I went to P00 and then VERB 47, and I'm
 ready to copy.
03 12 01 12 CC Okay. Do you have it in BLOCK?
03 12 01 17 CDR Say again.
03 12 01 18 CC I say, do you have the UP TELEMETRY in BLOCK?
03 12 01 24 CDR Roger.

Tape 56

03 12 01 26 CDR Okay. This PAD is a TEI 9, SPS/G&N: 45597,

 secondary Rigel, 129 155 010; four quads,
 15 second, ullage, horizons on 1.2-degree
 window line at T minus 3; use high speed procedure
 with minus Mike Alfa. After looking at
 the burn information from your previous SPS
 burns, it appears that the engine performance
 should give us a 3-second burn time, longer
 than what you have on the PAD. The PAD number
 should correspond with what you get out of the
 computer. So we have not factored this into
 the past data; however, you can anticipate the
 engine for a normal DELTA-V to give you a
 3 second - 3.7-second burn in excess of the
 computed times. Over.
03 12 05 52 CDR Roger. Thank you.
03 12 06 02 CDR TEI 9, SPS/G&N: 45597, minus 040, plus 157

 and that's Sirius and Rigel 129 155 010, four
 jet, 15 seconds, 1.2 degrees on the window at
 T minus 3, high speed minus MA, engine 3.7 seconds
 longer than given.
03 12 07 11 CC That's affirmative, Apollo 8. And when you get
 around to it, if you would like for us to dump
 your tape, we can do that when you get on the
 high gain.
03 12 07 25 CDR Roger.
03 12 08 06 CDR Okay. Should have it on the high gain now,
 Houston.
03 12 08 10 CC Roger. And we're going to go ahead and dump the
 tape.
03 12 08 20 CDR Roger.
03 12 08 42 CDR Ken, will we get the real TEI PAD the next time
 around now?
03 12 09 04 CC Apollo 8, we'll have one for you the next time
 around, and we'll update it if necessary on the
 following REV.
03 12 09 14 CDR Okay.
03 12 11 34 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
03 12 11 36 CC Go ahead.
03 12 11 40 CDR Do you have any idea why quad B seems so much
 lower in quantity than the other three quads?
03 12 11 47 CC Stand by.

Tape 56
Page 5
03 12 15 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 12 15 52 CDR Go ahead.
03 12 15 54 CC Okay. It looks to us like, although we're
 reading out the same thing you are on the quad
 quantity, using the computer program and all of
 the correction factors that are in there, it
 looks like all four of your quads are very close.
 In pounds, it looks like you have, for example,
 193 pounds in quad A and 189 in B, 200 in C,
 and 190 in Delta. And the difference that you
 read on the gage is attributed to the fact that
 you don't have all of the correction factors in
 there. This ground calculation has an accuracy
 of about plus or minus 6 percent, and the best
 you can do on board, even using your chart, is
 plus or minus 10 percent. Over.
03 12 16 44 CDR Thank you.

03 12 29 03 CC It's really beautiful; loud and clear and just
 right in temperature.
03 12 29 12 CDR How about the recovery area?
03 12 29 14 CC That's looking real good.
03 12 29 19 CDR Very good.
03 12 29 24 CC Yes. They told us that there is a beautiful moon
 out there.
03 12 29 32 CDR Now I was just saying that there's a beautiful
 earth out there.
03 12 29 36 CC It depends on your point of view.
03 12 29 40 CDR Yes.
03 12 29 54 CC If you're looking for things to do up there, Frank,
 you might hit that BIOMED switch over to the left

03 12 34 16 CC How about this antenna? Is that any better?
03 12 34 18 CC It's a little louder.
03 12 34 26 CDR Okay.
03 12 39 45 CDR Hey, Ken; how did you pull duty on Christmas Eve?
 It happens to bachelors every time, doesn't it?
03 12 39 52 CC I wouldn't be anywhere else tonight.
03 12 42 08 CDR Ken, how's the ... tracking on this lunar orbit
 coming out?
03 12 42 27 CC Okay. Frank, it's looking like it's coming right
 down the pike. It's doing just what it is supposed
 to, and apparently, all our computer programs
 have got the right numbers in them because
 they're predicting where you're going.
03 12 42 42 CDR Have they covered any of these anomalies due to
 high spots?
03 12 42 48 CC Roger. They're detectable, but they're not changing,
 things enough to be anything more than - of
 interest.

Tape 57
Page 3
03 12 42 58 CDR Fine. Hope they are as good with the corridor
 as they were with the LOI. That was beautiful.
03 12 43 03 CC It sure was. That's - that is textbook all the
 way.
03 12 44 24 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 12 44 29 CDR Go ahead.
03 12 44 31 CC Okay. We're about - inside 10 minutes till LOS.
 We'll be picking you up again at 85:40, and we'll
 have all of the TV types' information standing by.
 In the event that the situation develops again,
 for pointing accuracies, if I see anything that
 looks like a terminator or anything of that nature,
 I'm going to call the dark side of it 12 o'clock,
 and use that as a reference system, and we'll try
 that. If that doesn't dope out any problems with
 camera pointing, why I may try - call for a plus
 pitch, and then I'll just correct what I see to
 account for it.
03 12 45 16 CDR Roger. We're not going to use the telephoto lens.
 I don't believe we'll be able to get a picture of
 the earth. It's going to have to be the terminator,
 the lunar surface. I'm looking at the earth right
 now; and we won't see it again during that period.
03 12 45 31 CC Okay. Real fine then. And next time around, why,
 we'll take an extra special look at all of the
 parameters; we'll have our TEI PAD for you. And

Tape 57
Page 4
 we'll use the last REV for a real good hack on
 all systems. I'll give you a rundown by system
 of all things we see and where they stand.
03 12 45 55 CDR Okay. Fine.
03 12 50 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're approaching 4 minutes
 to LOS. All systems are GO.
03 12 50 25 CDR Roger. Thank you.

Comment 03 13 25 XX BEGIN LUNAR REV 9
03 13 42 56 LMP Houston.
03 13 42 58 CC Loud and clear and an initial look at your systems
 are good.
03 13 42 59 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
03 13 43 03 CC We've got a picture, Apollo 8.
03 13 43 07 LMP Roger. We've got the T - Roger. We've got the
 TV ...
03 13 43 13 LMP How does the picture look, Houston?
03 13 43 16 CC Loud and clear.
03 13 43 21 LMP The TV look okay?
03 13 43 23 CC That's very good.
03 13 43 28 CMP Welcome from the moon, Houston.
03 13 43 33 CC Thank you.
03 13 44 00 LMP Houston, you're seeing a view of the earth taken
 below the lunar horizon. We're going to follow a
 track until the terminator, where we will turn the
 spacecraft and give you a view of the long shadowed

Tape 57
Page 5
 terrain at the terminator, which should come in
 quite well in the TV.
03 13 44 26 CC Roger.
03 13 44 28 LMP We don't know whether you can see it from the TV
 screen, but the moon is nothing but a milky white -
 completely void. We're changing the cameras to the
 other window now.
03 13 44 58 CDR This is Apollo 8, coming to you live from the moon.
 We've had to switch the TV cameras now. We showed
 you first a view of earth as we've been watching it
 for the past 16 hours. Now we're switching so that
 we can show you the moon that we've been flying
 over at 60 miles altitude for the last 16 hours.
 Bill Anders, Jim Lovell, and myself have spent the
 day before Christmas up here doing experiments,
 taking pictures, and firing our spacecraft engines
 to maneuver around. What we will do now is follow
 the trail that we've been following all day and
 take you on through to a lunar sunset. The moon
 is a different thing to each one of us. I think
 that each one of us - each one carries his own impression
 of what he's seen today. I know my own
 impression is that it's a vast, lonely, forbidding-type
 existence, or expanse of nothing, that looks
 rather like clouds and clouds of pumice stone, and
 it certainly would not appear to be a very inviting

Tape 57
Page 6
 place to live or work. Jim, what have you thought
 most about?
03 13 46 23 CMP Well, Frank, my thoughts are very similar. The
 vast loneliness up here of the moon is awe inspiring,
 and it makes you realize just what you
 have back there on earth. The earth from here
 is a grand oasis in the big vastness of space.
03 13 46 41 CDR Bill, what do you think?
03 13 46 44 LMP I think the thing that impressed me the most was
 the lunar sunrises and sunsets. These in particular
 bring out the stark nature of the terrain,
 and the long shadows really bring out the relief
 that is here and hard to see at this very bright
 surface that we're going over right now.
03 13 47 05 CDR You're describe - that's not color, Bill. Describe
 some of the physical features of what
 you're showing the people.
03 13 47 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're not receiving a picture
 now. Over.
03 13 47 24 LMP We're now coming on to Smyth's Sea, a small mare
 region covered with a dark, level material. There
 is a fresh, bright, impact crater on the edge
 towards us and a mountain range on the other side.
 These mountains are the Pyrenees.
03 13 47 48 CC Apollo 8, we're not receiving modulation on the
 signal; we do have SYNC.
03 13 47 58 CDR Are you reading us? Apollo, Houston.

Tape 57
Page 7
03 13 48 02 CC Apollo 8, we're reading you loud and clear, but
 no picture. We have no modulation.
03 13 48 07 CMP Roger. We understand. Take a look now.
03 13 48 09 LMP How about now? Apollo.
03 13 48 12 CC Loud and clear. Good picture.
03 13 48 28 LMP What you're seeing has been cross - Smyth's Sea
 are the craters Castner and Gilbert, and what
 we've noticed especially, that you cannot see
 from the earth, are the small bright impact
 craters that dominate the lunar surface.
03 13 49 03 LMP The horizon here is very, very stark. The sky
 is pitch black, and the earth - or the moon,
 rather, excuse me - is quite light; and the contrast
 between the sky and the moon is a vivid,
 dark line. Coming into the view of the camera
 now are some interesting old double ring craters,
 some interesting features that are quite common
 in the mare region and have been filled by some
 material the same consistency of the maria and
 the same color. Here are three or four of these
 interesting features. Further on the horizon you
 see the ... The mountains coming up now are heavily
 impacted with numerous craters whose central
 peaks you can see in many of the larger ones.
03 13 50 08 CMP Actually, I think the best way to describe this
 area is a vastness of black and white, absolutely
 no color.

Tape 57
Page 8
03 13 50 22 LMP The sky up here is also rather forbidding, foreboding
 expanse of blackness, with no stars visible
 when we're flying over the moon in daylight.
03 13 50 52 LMP You can see by the numerous craters that this
 planet has been bombarded through the eons with
 numerous small asteroids and meteoroids pockmarking
 the surface every square inch.
03 13 51 11 CMP And one of the amazing features of the surface
 is the roundness that most of the craters - seems
 that most of them have a round mound type of appearance
 instead of sharp, jagged rocks.
03 13 51 23 LMP Only the newest feature is of any sharp definition
 to them, and eventually they get eroded down by
 the constant bombardment of small meteorites.
03 13 51 45 LMP How is the picture now, Houston? Houston, are
 you reading us?
03 13 51 54 CC Loud and clear, and the picture looks real fine.
03 13 52 00 LMP Thank you.
03 13 52 04 LMP Can you see the two large craters just to the
 right of our track, Houston?
03 13 52 15 CC That's affirmative.
03 13 52 51 LMP The very bright features you see are the new impact
 craters, and the longer a crater has been
 on the surface of the moon, why, the more mottled
 and subdued it becomes. Some of the - -
03 13 53 25 CC Apollo 8, we've apparently lost your voice; the
 picture is still good.

Tape 57
Page 9
03 13 53 32 LMP Roger.
03 13 53 37 CMP Houston, we're passing over an area that's just
 east of the Smyth's Sea now, in checking our
 charts. Smyth's Sea is coming up in a few minutes.
03 13 53 51 CC Roger.
03 13 54 12 CC Apollo 8, if you go to P00 and ACCEPT, we'll uplink
 some information.
03 13 54 43 LMP We are now coming up towards the terminator, and
 I hope soon that we'll be able to show you the
 varying contrast of white as we go into the darkness.
 Houston, we're in P00, and you have the
 computer.
03 13 54 58 CC Thank you.
03 13 55 16 LMP We're now approaching a series of small impact
 craters. There is a dark area between us and
 them which could possibly be an old lava flow.
03 13 55 58 LMP You can see the large mountains on the horizon
 now ahead of the spacecraft to the north of our
 track.
03 13 56 25 LMP The intensity of the sun's reflection in this
 area makes it difficult for us to distinguish
 the features we see on the surface, and I suppose
 it's even harder on the television, but as we approach
 the terminator and the shadows become longer,
 you'll see a marked change.

Tape 57
Page 10
03 13 57 00 LMP There is a very dark crater in the filling material
 in this valley in front of us now. It is rather
 unusual in that it is sharply defined, yet it's
 dark all over its interior walls, whereas most
 new-looking craters are of very bright interior.
03 13 57 38 LMP Small impact crater in front of us now in the little
 mare well defined, quite new, and another one
 approaching. The spacecraft is facing North.
 From our track, we are going sideways to our left.
03 13 58 11 LMP You are now seeing the Sea of Crises coming over
 the horizon.
END OF TAPE

Tape 58
Page 1
03 13 58 37 LMP We believe the crater, the large dark crater
 between the spacecraft and the Sea of Crises
 is Condorcet Crater. The Sea of Crises is
 amazingly smooth as far as the horizon and
 past this rather rough mountainous region in
 front of the spacecraft.
03 13 59 10 CC Apollo 8, we are through with the computer.
 You can go back to BLOCK, and it looks like
 we are getting a lot of reflection off your
 window now.
03 13 59 25 LMP Roger. We'll switch windows; How does that
 look now, Ken?
03 13 59 41 CC That's real fine.
03 14 00 26 CC Apollo 8, can you tell us which window you
 are looking out? And there is a large crater,
 looks like it is sticking up in the upper right
 hand corner of our picture. Can you identify
 that one?
03 14 00 43 LMP Roger. We are just about to lose our lock; that
 is why we are slowing up a little bit. We see
 the Sea of Crises in front of us now. We are
 looking out the left hand rendezvous window.
03 14 01 28 LMP Houston, how are you reading us now?
03 14 01 30 CC Loud and clear.
03 14 01 34 LMP The crater you see on the horizon is the Sea of
 Crises. How are you reading us, Houston?

Tape 58
Page 2
03 14 01 47 CC Loud and clear, Apollo 8, and we have a picture
 that is good.
03 14 01 51 LMP Right.
03 14 01 53 LMP Roger. We are getting a lot of static. The
 Sea of Crises is in front of us on the horizon,
 and the dark crater Picard can be seen in the
 middle. We are now breaking the moon's sunrise
 or the spacecraft's sunset. This is an area that
 the sun has just recently come up on the moon.
 The mare we are over now has a mottled look about
 it, but not very heavily cratered, so it must be
 relatively new. This is the Sea of Fertility,
 and we're coming upon a large crater, the delta
 rim variety; has a strange circular cracked
 pattern around the middle of it. The crater that
 you see now is about 30 or 40 miles across.
03 14 03 51 LMP How is your picture quality, Houston?
03 14 03 55 CC This is phenomenal.
03 14 04 00 LMP There is an interesting rill directly in front of
 the spacecraft now, running along the edge of
 a small mountain; rather sinuous shape with right-angle
 turns.
03 14 04 30 LMP This area just to the west of the Sea of Crises is
 called the Marsh of Sleep and to the west of that
 the Sea of Tranquility.
03 14 04 40 LMP Can you see the fracture patterns going across the
 mare in front of us now, Houston?

Tape 58
Page 3
03 14 04 47 CC That doesn't quite stand out.
03 14 04 53 LMP Roger. The series of cracks or faults across
 the middle of the mare: they drop down in about
 three steps to the south. The parallel fault
 pattern to the north has a drop down in the
 center. I hope all of you back down on earth
 can see what we mean when we say that it is
 a rather foreboding horizon, a very rather dark
 and unappetizing looking place. We are now going
 over - approaching one of our future landing
 sites selected in this smooth region to - called
 the Sea of Tranquility - smooth in order to make
 it easy for the initial landing attempts in order
 to preclude the having to dodge mountains. Now
 you can see the long shadows of the lunar sunrise.
 We are now approaching the lunar sunrise, and for
 all the people back on earth, the crew of Apollo 8
 has a message that we would like to send to you.
03 14 06 56 LMP In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the
 Earth.  And the Earth was without form and void,
 and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And
 the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,
 and God said, "let there be light." And there was
 light. And God saw the light and that it was good,
 and God divided the light from the darkness.
03 14 07 29 CMP And God called the light Day, and the darkness he
 called Night. And the evening and the morning

Tape 58
Page 4
 were the first day.  And God said, "let there be
 a firmament in the midst of the waters. And let
 it divide the waters from the waters."  And God
 made the firmament and divided the waters which
 were under the firmament from the waters which
 were above the firmament. And it was so. And
 God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening
 and the morning were the second day.
03 14 08 07 CDR And God said, "let the waters under the Heavens
 be gathered together into one place. And let
 the dry land appear." And it was so. And God
 called the dry land Earth. And the gathering
 together of the waters called the seas. And
 God saw that it was good. And from the crew of
 Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck,
 a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you - all
 of you on the good Earth.
03 14 09 46 CDR Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
03 14 09 48 CC Loud and clear, Apollo 8. And thank you for
 a very good show. We have a maneuver PAD for
 you when you are ready to copy.
03 14 10 00 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
03 14 10 02 CC Apollo 8, read you loud and clear.
03 14 10 07 CDR Roger. Are we off the air now?
03 14 10 21 CC That's affirmative, Apollo 8. You are.
03 14 10 26 CDR Did you read everything that we had to say there?

Tape 58
Page 5
03 14 10 29 CC Loud and clear. Thank you for a real
 good show.
03 14 10 34 CDR Okay. Now, Ken, we'd like to get all squared
 away for TEI here. Can you give us some good
 words like you promised?
03 14 10 41 CC Yes, sir. I have a maneuver PAD. I think we
 would like to start by dumping the tape. If
 we can have that, I have your TEI 10 maneuver
 PAD, and then we will run through a systems
 brief.
03 14 10 59 CDR I understand this is a maneuver PAD that we
 will use for TEI. Is that correct?
03 14 11 11 LMP And you got the tape, Houston.
03 14 11 13 CC Thank you.
03 14 11 18 CMP Ready to copy, Ken.
03 14 11 20 CC Roger. TEI 10, SPS/G&N: 45597, minus 040, plus

03 14 16 09 CC That's correct, Apollo 8.
03 14 16 17 CDR Ken, this is Frank. I want to - - I want to
 make one thing certain. This the load that
 we are to use to burn with, right? This is
 not just a PAD data for 10 abort?
03 14 16 32 CC Okay, Apollo 8. We will update this PAD prior
 to the burn.
03 14 16 40 CDR Oh, you will? Okay.
03 14 16 42 CC Yes, sir.
03 14 16 46 CDR Say again.
03 14 19 39 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 14 19 44 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
03 14 19 46 CC Roger. I am reading you with a lot of background
 noise. Can you read me clearly?
03 14 19 54 CDR Roger.
03 14 19 55 CC Okay. I am going to give you a quick summary
 of systems. Basically, all systems are good. In

Tape 58
Page 7
 respect to your return trajectory, we can still
 get to the mid-Pacific line at 146 hours by
 waiting as late as the thirteenth REV. After
 138 seconds of the burn, you are on your way
 home. The weather in the recovery area looks
 good. Apollo 8, did you call?
03 14 20 43 CDR Continue, Houston.
03 14 21 05 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Could we have the high gain
 for a little bit longer?
03 14 21 12 CDR We broke scan on it, Ken.
03 14 21 15 CC Okay. You are coming in loud and clear now.
 Did you copy my trajectory information?
03 14 21 20 CDR We are on OMNI B now.
03 14 21 23 CC Roger. That is fine.
03 14 21 24 CDR Say again, please. Go ahead. We are 130 -
 Will you say again, please?
03 14 21 29 CC Wilco, Apollo 8. First, if you can spare, we
 would like to have the high gain to complete
 the dump.
03 14 21 54 CDR Stand by. We will try to get it for you.
03 14 21 56 CC Roger.
03 14 22 17 CDR In a couple of minutes there, Houston.
03 14 22 19 CC Roger. Thank you.
03 14 22 47 CC Okay, Apollo 8. While we are - -
03 14 22 57 CC Apollo 8, while we are waiting for the high gain,
 I will continue the trajectory summary. We can

Tape 58
Page 8
 still get back to the mid-Pacific line in 146 hours
 from the thirteenth REV, and you are on your way
 after 138 seconds of the burn. That's 138 seconds,
 gets you clear of the butterfly region. We
 recommend not trying preignitions or restarts after
 20 seconds. If you go beyond 20 seconds, this may
 get the trajectory beyond the correction - RCS correction
 capability to a free return. The weather
 in recovery area is good. We have an AOS following
 TEI of 89 plus 28 plus 39 and an AOS without
 TEI of 89 plus 37 plus 24. During the burn, you
 may notice a slight change in chamber pressure and
 tank pressures due to the fuel exhaustion in the
 storage tank and going to the sump tank. This may
 occur somewhere around 2 to 5 seconds into the
 burn. It'll be a small change in pressures in both
 systems. Going down the systems, all systems are
 GO. In ECS, we want to stop water boiling after
 TEI for trajectory purposes. Your water dump
 situation looks good; you should be good to greater
 than 105 hours. We'll try to hold off the water
 dump until after MCC 5. In the EPS, we'd like to
 stir the cryos prior to TLI - correction TEI. The
 next purge on the fuel cells will occur at approximately
 92 hours, and that will be both hydrogen
 and oxygen. Your battery status: battery A 34.9,
 battery B 39.1, and Charlie 38.5. We have the

Tape 58
Page 9
 single tank cryo capability. SPS: looking at
 the performance on the previous burns, you can
 anticipate a normal burn taking approximately
 3.7 seconds in excess of the computed values.
 Engine performance looks nominal, and all parameters
 have been steady. RCS looks good; all
 four quads according to the computer programs
 have approximately the same capacity. You have
 a good REFSMMAT to take you through TEI. We'll
 have a post TEI PTC attitude for you in a few
 minutes. and that just about wraps up what we
 have on systems. Over.
03 14 26 43 CDR Roger. Thank you, Houston. We appreciate the
 summary. We're trying to get high gain.
03 14 26 49 CC Roger,
03 14 26 53 CMP I think we have it.
03 14 26 54 CDR You do have the high gain. Now, Ken, as I
 understand it, if it shuts down after 20 seconds of burn, you
 don't want us to try to re-light it. Is that what you said?
03 14 27 04 CC Stand by.
03 14 27 12 CC Apollo 8, the intent was do not delay ignitions
 beyond 20 seconds. Over.
03 14 27 21 CDR Oh, do not delay ignition beyond 20 seconds
 Roger.
03 14 27 24 CC That's affirm.

Tape 58
Page 10
03 14 27 27 CDR Okay. You want me to start it on tank A and
 then switch to B again like we did on our LOI,
 right?
03 14 27 39 CC That's affirmative.
03 14 27 43 CDR Okay.
03 14 27 47 CDR Did you put in this PAD for us? Should P30 and
 40 be in our computer now?
03 14 28 19 CC Apollo 8, that's negative. We had not uplinked
 this PAD. We'll put this one in on the next pass.
03 14 28 26 CDR Okay. Roger.
03 14 33 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You have a GO for this REV.
03 14 33 34 CMP Roger, Houston.
03 14 38 29 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We have completed the tape
 dump, and the recorder is yours.
03 14 38 35 CDR Thank you.
03 14 43 03 LMP Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8 on OMNI C.
03 14 43 06 CC Loud and clear.
03 14 43 10 LMP Thank you.
03 14 44 27 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're 5 minutes to LOS;
 we'll have AOS Honeysuckle at 87:38:42.
03 14 44 42 CMP Roger.
03 14 52 14 CC Apollo 8, everything looks good going over the hill.
03 14 52 21 CDR Roger, Ken. Thanks a lot. We'll see you around
 the next pass. Just have our TEI update for us

 try to get you the high gain.
03 15 40 57 CDR Ken, read us off the PAD in case you can't get
 the dump in; we can still do it.

03 15 54 46 CC Apollo 8, Houston. At 87:48, we're reading
 84 degrees, and at LOS we had 80. We'll take
 a look at the tape and see if we can find out
 what we had on the backside.
03 15 55 03 LMP Okay. I would kind of like to know what I might
 expect at ignition here at TEI.
03 15 55 11 CC Roger. We'll take that off the tape.
03 15 55 19 CMP Houston; this is 8. I take it you have loaded
 both state vectors; is that correct?
03 15 55 24 CC That's affirmative.
03 15 55 28 CMP Roger.
03 15 55 33 CC We loaded your CSM and LM NAV and external
 DELTA-V, in that order.
03 15 55 43 CMP Roger.
03 16 03 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 16 03 33 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
03 16 03 36 CC Okay, Apollo 8. We've reviewed all your systems.
 You have a GO for TEI. One of the things we
 would like to do as soon as you come out on the
 other side is a P23. We are checking into your
 helium pressures now. We're going to correlate
 not only the last REV but the previous REV for
 the same location, and we will have that number
 for you in a little bit.
03 16 04 03 CDR Okay.
03 16 09 47 CC Apollo 8, Houston. The tape recorder is yours.
 I have your PTC attitude.

Tape 59

03 16 09 55 CDR Roger. Go ahead.
03 16 09 58 CC Okay. PTC attitude vi11 be pitch 10, yaw 45.
 This begins at 92 hours. Over.
03 16 10 11 CDR Is that pitch 10 and yaw 45?
03 16 10 14 CC Affirmative. And looks like that will go with
 the entry REFSMMAT; begins at 92 hours.
03 16 10 24 CDR Thank you.
03 16 10 31 CC Apollo 8, would you put your UP TELEMETRY to
 BLOCK, please?
03 16 10 40 CMP In BLOCK.
03 16 14 49 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 16 14 54 CDR Go ahead.
03 16 14 56 CC Okay. On the helium tank TEMP's: that's not
 recorded on low bit rate, and looking over our
 tape dumps, most of this stuff we have on the
 backside there is low bit rate. So we won't
 be able to give you an exact number, but looking
 at what we have every time we go out of
 sight and come back over the hill, it looks
 like you can expect about 82 to 84 degrees as
 a nominal temperature.
03 16 15 22 CDR Thank you.
03 16 28 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to have the tape
 recorder for about 5 minutes for one last look.
03 16 28 35 CMP Roger, Houston. You're getting it.

Tape 59
Page 6
03 16 28 38 CC Thank you. And I guess we still have a cryo stir
 ahead of us, and we've checked your triple bias,
 and there's no change.
03 16 28 52 LMP Roger. And we're stirring cryos right now.
03 16 28 56 CC Thank you.
03 16 31 20 CDR Ken, are you through with the tape recorder?
03 16 31 23 CC Stand by one.
03 16 31 28 CDR We're on a maneuver to burn attitude, and it's
 going to make us lose the high gain.
03 16 31 57 CC Apollo 8, the tape recorder is yours. We have
 your double umbra update, 89:07:15.87.
03 16 32 11 CDR Roger. Copy.
03 16 32 13 CC Roger. And no change on your AOS time.
03 16 32 20 CDR Say that again, will you, Ken?
03 16 32 22 CC There's no change on your AOS time.
03 16 32 28 CDR Now what was it?
03 16 32 31 CC Okay. With TEI, 89:28:39.
03 16 32 40 CDR Thank you.
03 16 32 42 CC Roger.
03 16 47 37 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We have 3 minutes to LOS;
 all systems are GO.
03 16 48 06 CC Apollo 8, Apollo 8, this is Houston. Three

 See them in black.
03 17 57 25 CC Roger.
03 17 59 01 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We would like to have you cycle

03 17 59 11 CDR Roger. We are going to see if we can find some
 stars here before we do this P52.
03 17 59 18 CC Roger. And got a couple of words for you. Jack's
 been watching you since LOI, and he has a few words
 he wants to give you.
03 17 59 30 CDR Go ahead.
03 17 59 31 CC Typhoid Jack here, and we have got some good words
 here that originated at the Cape with a bunch of
 friends of yours. And it's sort of in a paraphrase
 of a poem that you probably are familiar with. Do
 you read me, Apollo 8?
03 17 59 50 CDR You are loud and clear, Jack.


Tape 60
Page 6
03 17 59 53 CC Okay. "'Twas the night before Christmas and way
 out in space, the Apollo 8 crew had just won the
 moon race. The headsets were hung by the consoles
 with care in hopes that Chris Kraft soon would be
 there. Frank Borman was nestled all snug in his
 bed, while visions of REFSMMAT's danced in his
 head; and Jim Lovell, in his couch, and Anders,
 in the bay, were racking their brains over a computer
 display. When out of the DSKY, there arose
 such a clatter, Frank sprang from his bed to see
 what was the matter. Away to the sextant he flew
 like a flash to make sure they weren't going to
 crash. The light on the breast of the moon's
 jagged crust gave a luster of green cheese to the
 gray lunar dust. When what to his wondering eyes
 should appear, but a Burma Shave sign saying 'Kilroy
 was here.' (Laughter) But Frank was no fool; he
 knew pretty quick that they had been first; this
 must be a trick. More rapid than rockets, his
 curses they came. He turned to his crewmen and
 called them a name. Now Lovell, now Anders, now
 don't think I'd fall for an old joke you've written
 up on the wall. They spoke not a word, but grinning
 like elves, and laughed at their joke in spite of
 themselves. Frank sprang to his couch, to the

Tape 60
Page 7
 ship gave a thrust, and away they all flew past
 the gray lunar dust. But we heard them explain
 ere they flew around the moon: Merry Christmas
 to earth; we will be back there real soon."
 Great job, gang.
03 18 01 30 CDR Thank you very much. That was a very good poem;
 but in order to win the race, you have got to
 end up on the carriers.
03 18 01 38 CC We will see you there.
03 18 01 40 CMP Hey, Jack. You really got Bill trained. (Laughter)
03 18 01 44 LMP Okay.
03 18 01 45 CC I certainly hope so.
03 18 01 47 CC You did pretty well, Jim.
03 18 01 52 CC You must have talked on the way out there.
 (Laughter)
03 18 07 21 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8.
03 18 07 24 CC Go ahead.
03 18 07 28 CDR Roger.. We got an alignment with your new REFSMMAT
 now. What's on the program here? You want us in
 P23 and then what?
03 18 07 40 CC Looks like some sleep is coming up.
03 18 07 46 CDR That's what I wanted you to say. We used up
 the gimbal angles of 10 and 45 with the - this
 REFSMMAT, right?
03 18 07 54 CC Affirmative.
03 18 07 58 CDR Okay.

Tape 60
Page 8
03 18 13 56 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 18 14 00 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
03 18 14 03 CC Roger. Notice that you are starting on your P23
 which is the last scheduled activity. Initial
 tracking looks like the initial midcourse may be
 less than the 4 foot per second on the first guess.
 And we have looked at your burn data, and it's
 all just as smooth as you said; everything on
 there looked real nominal. Systems now look good;
 looks like in PTC attitude, we should be able to
 switch OMNI's for you, if you would like to do that.
 We were having good success with predicting on the
 way out where to switch the antennas, and if it
 will help you any, we can do that on the way back
 in.
03 18 14 48 CDR That would be nice if you could do it, but we will
 keep one man in the shop to watch the gimbal angles;
 but if you could switch the OMNI's, it would sure
 save us a lot of problems.
03 18 14 58 CC Okay. We will do that. When you get in the PTC
 attitude, we will let you know when we take the
 command on the antenna switching.
03 18 15 10 CDR Okay. Just be careful what you do with the tape
 recorder. Bill's a little sensitive about that.
03 18 15 25 CC Roger. We were listening to the tape dumps, and
 it looks like Bill gets a happy new year after all.

Tape 60
Page 9
03 18 15 35 CDR A happy new year? How come, Jack - an, in a
 joke?
03 18 15 40 CC No, we got that off of his tape dump; he and Jim
 were discussing that one.
03 18 15 48 CDR Oh, yes. That's right.
03 18 35 16 CDR Houston, are you getting all this data from P23?
03 18 35 39 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
03 18 35 40 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
03 18 35 44 CDR I wanted to know if you're getting the data from
 P23?
03 18 35 47 CC That's affirmative.

03 19 10 36 CDR Okay. It's maneuver to pitch 10 and yaw 45.
03 19 10 41 CC Roger. I have - let's see, we've got a hydrogen
 purge line here that ought to come on about
 91:40 and an oxygen-hydrogen fuel cell purge
 for 92 hours.
03 19 10 59 CDR Okay. Will you call us about those, please?
03 19 11 02 CC I sure will. And, let's see, we just wanted
 to let you know we've got a real good battery
 charge going here this time. Looks like - it
 looks just like the ones in the back, and I'd
 like to get a battery C voltage before you shut
 down, and a sleep report on what you did in - -
03 19 11 22 CDR Okay.
03 19 11 23 CC - - lunar orbit and your plans for the next
 couple of hours.

Tape 61
Page 2
03 19 11 50 CC Roger. Thirty-seven volts.
03 19 11 52 CDR That looks good.
03 19 11 59 CDR We all only got about 2 hours sleep today MAX,
 Ken. We're going now - Bill's going to stay up
 awhile, and Jim and I are going to sack out,
 and we're going to try to rotate short sleep
 cycles till we can get back to the normal one.
03 19 12 12 CC Roger, sounds like a good idea. And EECOM
 on the ground tells us that the flying EECOM is to go
 ahead and put his hydrogen purge line heater
 on, and we'll get ready for a fuel cell.
03 19 12 27 CDR Thank you. He can't turn on his radio. There
 he goes.
03 19 12 44 CDR I hope it won't disappoint anybody too much
 if we knock off those last two stars, but Jim
 is just in a daze, and so am I.
03 19 12 50 CC Roger. No sweat.
03 19 12 55 CDR Thank you.
03 19 13 19 CC Apollo 8. One of the things we'd like to have
 before you shut down also is VERB 64 so we can
 watch the pointing angles.
03 19 13 30 CDR Roger.
03 19 13 35 CC Hey, Frank, you might be interested; they are
 having some trouble with the medics' P-2.
03 19 13 45 CDR What?
03 19 13 48 LMP The medics can't clean out their P-2.

Tape 61

03 19 14 01 CDR Oh, is that right? It's been so busy.
03 19 14 02 CC Oh, yeah. It's worn the thing out at the
 bearings. (Laughter)
03 19 14 33 CDR Hey, Ken, tell the people if you see anything
 getting close to the gimbal lock to be sure and
 whistle, too, will you?
03 19 14 40 CC We sure will, Frank. You will want to make sure
 one of you keeps your COMM carrier on.
03 19 14 43 CDR We'll keep one man with a headset on.
03 19 14 50 CDR That's right. We'll keep one man with a COMM
 carrier on.
03 19 19 39 CC Apollo 8. You have got some big yaw angle there.
03 19 19 55 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 19 20 04 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 19 20 11 CC Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston.

03 19 22 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 19 24 56 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 19 28 16 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Copy that you are now in
 PTC attitude, and we're watching your gimbal
 angle. We apparently do not have a downlink
 voice, but the data is good.
03 19 28 53 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
03 19 28 55 CC Loud and clear, 8.

Tape 61
Page 4
03 19 29 07 LMP Okay. We're establishing PTC. We took one
 last look at the moon and on our way back.
03 19 29 13 CC Roger.
03 19 32 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 19 32 23 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
03 19 32 25 CC Okay. In order for us to handle the antenna
 switching, I guess we'd like to have the AUX
 tape switched to OFF, and the tape FORWARD
 switch OFF; and we'll be switching between
 OMNI's Bravo and Delta.
03 19 33 01 LMP Between what and what?
03 19 33 05 CC Okay. We are going to be switching between
 OMNI's Bravo and Delta.
03 19 33 14 LMP Okay.
03 19 33 17 CC Alright. And I'm gonna - you bug me when you
 get over 50 degrees of yaw, so I'll probably
 be watching that number pretty closely. We'd
 like to have the BIOMED switched to the right
 position. Okay. And for your own information:
 the fuel we show in the different quads I have
 here if you would like to copy it.
03 19 34 07 LMP Stand by.
03 19 35 50 LMP Okay. Ready to copy.
03 19 35 54 CC Okay. I'll give you the percentage on Alfa 60,
 Bravo 57, Charlie ...


Tape 61
Page 5
03 19 36 11 LMP Wait a minute. It asks for present time, and
 I can't plot that fast, Ken.
03 19 36 15 CC Okay. I'm sorry. Alfa is 60.
03 19 36 22 LMP For what time?
03 19 36 26 CC 91:36.
03 19 36 35 LMP Okay. stand by.
03 19 36 44 LMP Okay. What's Bravo?
03 19 36 46 CC Okay. That's 57.
03 19 36 59 LMP Okay.
03 19 37 00 CC Charlie 62.
03 19 37 19 LMP Okay.
03 19 37 20 CC And Delta 57.33842.
03 19 37 33 LMP That's a coincidence.
 That's just what I worked out on Lovell's slide rule.
03 19 37 46 LMP How are we doing on the cryos?
03 19 37 52 CC Oh, you've got some pretty good numbers on
 that that I sent up yesterday, and you had
 about 160 hours. Well, I'll check that out,
 but you were fat on cryo. I've got some SPS
 DELTA-V. You've got 33:20. You fly the service
 module RCS through the DAP. You have 142; and
 through SCS, it's 121.
03 19 38 43 LMP Roger.
03 19 39 55 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We can't monitor on low
 bit rate whether you started your fuel cell
 purge. If you haven't, we can still go ahead

Tape 61
Page 6
 and start now; and if you can, keep us posted
 as you go through it.
03 19 40 08 LMP Roger. You want an O<sub>2</sub> and an H<sub>2</sub> purge, Ken?
03 19 40 12 CC That's affirmative.
03 19 40 18 LMP You shall have it.
03 19 40 19 CC Thank you.
03 19 51 59 CC Apollo 8, Houston - -
03 19 52 05 LMP Go ahead.
03 19 52 07 CC It looks like you may be in OMNI Alfa. Can
 you confirm that we're set up to switch between
 Bravo and Delta?
03 19 52 29 LMP You are now.
03 19 52 31 CC Okay. Thank you very much. And you are in the
 fuel cell purge?
03 19 52 39 LMP It's complete.
03 19 52 41 CC Okay. Understand the purge is complete. Thank
 you. And in reference to your cryo, it looks
 like we'll have 180 pounds in each oxygen tank
 at SEP and 11 pounds in each hydrogen tank.
 And you're well above the single tank capability.
03 19 53 16 LMP Okay. Thank you.

 feature news and sports news for you if you'd
 like to hear it.

03 23 11 12 CC Roger. We'll start out with the sports news.
 Los Angeles Dodger pitcher, Sandy Koufax, and
 Ann Widmark, 23-year-old daughter of actor Richard
 Widmark, plan to marry some time in the near
 future. Koufax said Tuesday that no date for the
 wedding was set, but he and Miss Widmark have
 been dating for some time. At Springfield, - -
03 23 11 40 CMP ...
03 23 11 44 CC Say again.
03 23 11 49 CMP Morning. How do you read?
03 23 11 51 CC Good morning, Jim.
03 23 11 55 CC Let's see. In Springfield, Missouri, Mickey Owen,
 the old-time catcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers who
 made the record books by dropping a third strike
 that led the New York Yankees to a victory over
 the Dodgers in the '41 World Series, decided that
 he would be remembered by more than just his
 sports record. Forty-five boys and girls have
 been the recipients of ponies that he offered.
 These youngsters were requested to send letters
 in telling him how they would care for a pony.
 When the letters poured in, he added five ponies
 to the 20 he already offered; and other donors
 pitched in 20 more. And said Mickey Owen, "I
 thought I'd have about 45 letters, but I ended

Tape 63

 up with about 900." Now on the feature page:
 Wellington, New Zealand, about fifty men sat
 down to the traditional turkey and cranberry
 sauce at the South Pole today, but the Christmas
 had an Oriental flavor, as well. It included
 Sukiyaki cooked by members of a Japanese party
 who are crossing the Antarctic continent and
 stopped for the day with the U.S. Navy Polar
 base. In San Diego, California, the crewmen
 of the captured intelligence ship Pueblo donated
 their first paychecks to the workers at San
 Diego's Balboa Naval Hospital. They had all been
 given twenty dollars each, and - when they
 landed in San Diego - and they felt that this
 was a good demonstration of their feelings for
 those who had done so much to make their welcome
 here.
03 23 14 11 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We read your antenna change.
 Are you still reading us?
03 23 14 18 CDR Roger. This is Apollo 8, Houston.
03 23 14 20 CC Roger.
03 23 14 21 CDR We just now changed antennas, or you must have.
03 23 14 24 CC Okay.
03 23 14 26 CDR You lost ...
03 23 14 30 CC In Reno, Nevada. Oh, that's affirmative, Frank.
 We changed the antennas from here.

03 23 14 41 CDR Thank you.
03 23 14 43 CC In Reno, Nevada, because there is no fireplace
 in his home, ... a little boy wrote Santa Claus
 in care of the local newspaper and suggested,
 "would you please use the front door. You will
 have to kick the bottom a little bit because
 it sticks." In Little Rock, Arkansas, babies
 born at St. Vincent Infirmary during the week
 before Christmas and through Christmas Day are
 being released to their mothers at discharge
 time in huge red Christmas stockings. Here is
 one in ecumenical cooperation. In Indio,
 California, the Chief of Police was armed
 Christmas Day with a prayer book. Rabbi Phillip
 H. Weinburg has taken over as Chief for a day
 so the real Police Chief, Homer Hunt, a Methodist
 could spend the holiday with his family. This
 is the third straight Christmas the Rabbi has
 filled in for Hunt. The previous 6 years,
 Rabbi Weinburg did the same for the Roman
 Catholic Police Chief of Reno, Nevada.
