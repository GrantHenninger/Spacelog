01 11 18 20 CDR Go ahead, Hawaii M&O. This is Apollo 8. How
 do you read?
01 11 18 25 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
01 11 18 37 CDR Okay. Thank you, Hawaii. How do you read?
01 11 21 15 F Hawaii, Houston Network. Voice check on GOSS
 Conference.
01 11 21 24 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 11 26 41 CT Hawaii LOS. Unable to find.
01 11 27 07 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 11 27 14 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 11 27 55 CC Hawaii, this is Houston CAP COM. Over.
01 11 28 13 CT Houston CAP COM, Hawaii.
01 11 28 16 CC Hawaii, Houston CAP COM. I would like to have
 a voice check.
01 11 28 18 CT Roger. I read you loud and clear.
01 11 28 21 CC Okay. I'm reading you loud and clear. I understand
 you have contact with the spacecraft.
 Is that affirm?
01 11 28 26 CC I have uplink voice to the spacecraft; the downlink
 is too low in the mud.
01 11 28 32 CC Okay. Understand that you have good uplink, but
 your downlink is in the mud. You don't have any
 way of copying it either, is that correct --
01 11 28 40 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. ... again. How do you read?
01 11 28 41 CT That is affirmative.

Tape 25
Page 3
01 11 28 45 CC Okay, Hawaii, we can hear Apollo 8, calling down.
 Would you answer and tell them that we did copy
 that?
01 11 28 53 CC Roger.
01 11 28 57 CT Apollo 8, Hawaii M&O. Houston reports they
 copied your last.
01 11 29 03 CDR Okay. Thank you.
01 11 29 08 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
01 11 29 30 F Hawaii, Houston Network, GOSS Conference.
01 11 29 37 F Hawaii, Houston Network, GOSS Conference. Your
 NET 2.
01 11 29 41 CT Houston Network, Hawaii.
01 11 29 43 F Roger. Did you copy the CAP COM?
01 11 29 46 CT Affirm. We copied the CAP COM.
01 11 29 49 F Is he keying the transmitters out there?
01 11 29 58 CT He did key it one time, Network.
01 11 30 01 F Okay. I'm going to ask him to call the spacecraft
 again, and I would like for you to give me
 a report if he does not key the transmitters.
01 11 30 11 CT Roger, Network. Is our NET 1 now conferenced up --
01 11 30 15 CC Your NET 2 is conferenced to our GOSS Conference
 here.
01 11 30 21 CT Roger. How about our GOSS Conference loop?
01 11 30 23 CC Your GOSS Conference loop is dead.
01 11 30 26 CT Roger. We are GO for command. We were unable
 to transmit before.

Tape 25
Page 4
01 11 30 31 CC Understand.
01 11 30 32 CC We transmitted to the spacecraft as per CAP COM
 and they acknowledged our transmission.
01 11 30 39 CC Apollo 8. Houston.
01 11 30 43 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
01 11 30 45 CC Okay. We got back together again. You're loud
 and clear. We've been reading you. We have a
 problem down here on the ground getting our
 signal from MCC out to remote site.
01 11 31 01 CDR Roger. Understand.
01 11 32 52 CC Apollo 8. Houston. I've got a ball score for
 you. It was Oakland 41, Kansas City 6 is the
 final score. That's 41 to 6, Oakland. We're
 trying to get some news releases over here for
 you. I suspect we're going to find that the
 staged TV show was probably the biggest news
 of the day.
01 11 32 20 CDR I'm sorry that the TV lens broke down.
01 11 32 26 CC Well, we're working on that some more. I'm
 not sure that the whole thing is lost yet. It
 appears that our problem is one where the light
 intensity which is sensed by our light meter
 in there is picking up an average field which
 is much larger than the earth, and so it's sensing
 a great deal of deep space environment which
 is dark, and we're suspicious that this is probably
 opening up the lens aperture as wide as it

Tape 25
Page 5
 will go, and then when you point the camera at
 the earth while the earth is only filling about
 3 degrees of cone angle, whereas lens takes in
 9. So it looks like you're probably just saturating
 the tube. Now we're playing around now
 with some --
01 11 33 14 CDR We just lost you again, Houston.
01 11 33 16 CC Say again.
01 11 33 20 CDR I just lost your last transmission; you were
 clipped.
01 11 33 24 CC 04. Did you get any of my comments about the
 TV tube?
01 11 33 33 CDR Roger. Got them.
01 11 33 35 CC Okay. What I - what we've got in mind here is
 that we are looking at some of the lenses you
 have on board for cameras, and we are going to
 see if one of them can possibly be used to attenuate
 some of this light so that you will be
 able to take one of these pictures, and we are
 running some tests now, and we'll let you know
 about those. I also have a maneuver PAD that
 I need to read up to you whenever it's convenient.
01 11 34 04 CDR Let me get a pencil. Be fine right now.
01 11 34 07 CC Okay.
01 11 34 19 CDR Go ahead, Houston.

01 11 40 46 CDR Go ahead.
01 11 40 48 CC Okay. This flyby PAD is an update to one that
 we gave you yesterday so you might want to note
 that this is the second one. And it will be a

01 11 45 47 CC That's correct, Apollo 8.
01 11 45 52 CDR Thank you.
01 11 48 26 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
01 11 48 29 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
01 11 48 32 CDR Okay. The CMP is now up. We'll proceed with
 the 52 option and start on the cislunar navigation.
01 11 48 43 CC Okay. Thank you, and we'll start looking for
 some star data.
01 11 53 58 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 11 54 02 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
01 11 54 05 CC Okay. When you pick up your activities, I have
 a preferred alignment here that I want you to be
 in when you do your P52, and I'll have about
 four items to change on your time lines, so if
 you give me a call when you're ready for it.
01 11 54 23 CDR We're ready right now. We were doing the P52.
 You want to hold off and go to a particular
 alignment, is that right?
01 11 54 32 CC Affirmative.
01 11 54 33 CDR All right. I'm ready.
01 11 54 35 CC Okay. The attitude is pitch 23.4, roll 184.7,
 yaw 14.3. And the reason we're doing the alignment
 in this attitude is, the next thing we'll

Tape 25
Page 9
 be coming up with is the scanning telescope visibility
 test and that will be 70 degrees sun
 and Arcturus with a shaft and trunnion of zero.
 and then we can go ahead with the P52 and then
 a trunnion bias followed by P23 with the same
 stars we read to you before.
01 11 55 24 CDR Okay.
01 12 00 32 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. We're maneuvering to the
 angles you - you gave us.
01 12 00 35 CC All right. Thank you.
01 12 09 45 CDR Houston, we've reached the preferred attitude,
 and we're proceeding with the P52.
01 12 09 49 CC Okay. Real fine, and I'll pass up some advice
 from your friendly flight surgeon. He says
 you're supposed to take one more Lomotil.
01 12 10 03 CDR Okay. Everybody, or just me?
01 12 10 07 CC Just Frank.
01 12 10 10 CDR Thank you.
01 12 13 20 CMP Houston, the P52 is completed. We're ready for
 your other data.
01 12 13 28 CC Okay. Understand that you've done the P52. The
 next item on the flight plan should be a scanning
 telescope visibility test, and this is the same
 one that was on your flight plan previously at
 34 hours and about 12 minutes, and we'll be
 checking that 70 degree sun's on Arcturus. Following
 that, we need to make a trunnion bias

Tape 25
Page 10
 check, and then we'll go into a P23, and I can
 read you those star numbers and sets if you
 don't have them from the last time I read them
 up.
01 12 14 13 CMP Okay. Standby.
01 12 14 20 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 12 14 22 CC Go ahead.
01 12 14 26 CMP Roger. With such good visibility or such good
 communications, we'll just give you a verbal
 description without seeing the scanning telescope
 right now. Your angles for maneuvering
 to Arcturus were quite good. I've got
 Arcturus centered in the scanning telescope.
 At this sun angle, there is a shaft of light
 directly across the center of the scanning telescope
 and - band of light. It precludes seeing
 alot of stars around us, and although I
 kept my eye glued to the telescope now for
 some time, it's very difficult to see any star
 patterns or anything. I couldn't recognize
 that with Arcturus unless I - the optics just
 drove me there. Now because I'm near zero
 shaft and zero trunnion, I'm getting quite a
 bit of shaft movement. Everytime the shaft
 moves, more particles leave the optics, and
 they're just as bright as the surrounding stars.

Tape 25
Page 11
 And they mingle in the stars, and you can't
 tell star patterns or constellations. With
 this particular attitude, the shaft of light
 precludes any identification of constellations
 or individual stars.
01 12 15 47 CC Okay. Copy that. Can you tell us something
 about the orientation of this band? You mentioned
 that last night also - that you also had
 a band about 10 degrees wide that ran across.
 Is there an orientation that we can tie that to?
01 12 16 05 CMP I believe so, Ken. This band is parallel to
 the M-line, and I think it has something to do
 with the design of the optics where we have
 that shaft or the rectangular entrance of the
 optics from the outside. At this particular
 sun angle, it cuts right across. Now I noticed
 that both the earth and the sun do this to the
 scanning telescope. In the sextant, the same
 light band is there, although it covers the
 entire sextant's field of view. However, the
 magnification brings out the stars quite well,
 and it is possible to mark on it. But the
 identification of the stars with the scanning
 telescope makes it very difficult. Now the
 attitude that I found the optics are best at
 are the attitudes which give the constellations

Tape 25
Page 12
 Canis Major and Orion in the scanning telescope.
 At this, this particular attitude of the
 spacecraft, the band is gone; we're at a position
 whereby the sun is behind us, and I can
 see quite a few stars. Now yesterday I could
 also, after getting dark-adapted, see quite a
 few stars around the constellation Cassiopeia
 which at first I couldn't. But right now this
 band precludes you see anything at all except Arcturus
 which, of course, I know we're aiming at right
 now.
01 12 17 34 CC Okay. Thank you very much.
01 12 18 08 CDR Ken, what stars did you want to use? Did you
 want to read them off?
01 12 18 12 CC Okay. First star will be 26, and we'll be making
 two sets of measurements, earth near-horizon
 using star 26. Then we would like to have one
 set on star 16, that's 16, using the earth far-horizon.
 If it turns out that star 26 earth
 near-horizon is not possible, then we'd like to
 have star 16 on the earth far-horizon for one
 set, and star 22 earth far-horizon one set.
 Over.
01 12 19 04 CDR You want star 26, earth near-horizon, two sets;
 star 16, earth far-horizon, one set; and star 22,
 earth far-horizon, one set.

Tape 25
Page 13
01 12 19 18 CC Okay. That's star 22 only in the event that 26
 on the earth's near horizon is not possible?
 Over.
01 12 19 27 CDR We won't even do star 22 then unless we can't
 get 26 on the near horizon.
01 12 19 31 CC That's affirmative.
01 12 20 25 LMP COMM sure is good all of a sudden, isn't it?
01 12 20 28 CC Yes, this is outstanding.

01 12 50 52 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
01 12 50 54 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
01 12 50 57 CDR Okay, we have completed two sets on 26 and one
 set on 16.
01 12 51 02 CC Roger. Getting pretty speedy there.
01 12 51 08 CDR Jim is getting to know the objects.
01 12 51 11 CMP Are you receiving the data, Houston?
01 12 51 13 CC Affirmative.
01 12 51 16 CMP Okay.
01 12 51 19 CC Keeping you honest.
01 12 51 23 CMP Right.
01 12 51 40 CC Okay, Apollo 8. We have looked at the data and
 it looks good and they feel like you can go back
 to PTC attitude anytime you are ready to. And if
 you can - go ahead.
01 12 51 56 CDR What attitude do you want to use? The same one?
01 12 52 00 CC That's affirmative.
01 12 52 04 CDR Thank you.
01 12 52 05 CC Okay, if you can reach over Bill there and get
 to panel 3, I believe we would like to cycle the
 oxygen fans. And also like to get the BIOMED
 switch over to CMP.
01 12 52 24 CDR Okay.
01 12 52 27 CC If you have to bother Bill to do that, why, we can
 hold off on the cryo fans.
01 12 52 31 CDR No, he moved. We already chased him under the
 seat. Okay, now you want just the oxygen fans on?

Tape 26
Page 2
01 12 52 38 CC That's affirm. Turn one on for about 2 minutes
 and when we turn it off, then we will turn the
 next one on. We don't want to turn them on
 simultaneously though.
01 12 52 49 CDR I know that. I mean you don't want hydrogen
 though?
01 12 52 53 CC That's affirmative. Just the oxygen.
01 12 54 12 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 12 54 16 CC Go ahead.
01 12 54 20 CMP Ken, just recap a little explanation here on your
 maneuver PAD, something which I'm really not
 knowledgeable about, the way it was presented to
 us, you mentioned fast return P37 DELTA-V of 8750,
 just briefly clarify that, will you please?
01 12 54 42 CC Okay, stand by.
01 12 57 43 CDR Ken, can you give us a little report on how our
 trajectory looks and the tracking is going and
 things like that?
01 12 57 50 CC Okay, sure will. I will put a summary together
 here.
01 12 57 55 CDR And the pericynthian sign.
01 12 57 57 CC Roger, we will get all that together for you in
 just a few minutes.
01 12 58 01 CDR And we never did get the news.
01 12 58 05 CC You are the news.
01 12 58 09 CDR Come off it, come off it.

Tape 26
Page 3
01 12 58 41 CDR Okay, the fans have been cycled 2 minutes each
 and they are back off.
01 12 58 45 CC Okay, thank you very much.
01 13 06 07 LMP Houston, Apollo 8 is back in the PTC attitude,
 reads MHPTC.
01 13 06 12 CC Okay, thank you. And in reference to your question
 about the P37 DELTA-V, 8750, that's the
 number that goes into the option at P37 for your
 minimum time return. That gives you a target for
 the Indian Ocean. And in this case, we are going
 to have to use the high-speed procedures that were
 worked out for you to use some minus number for
 the major axis.
01 13 06 47 CMP Roger. Understand. I'm going to give that a try,
 Ken, in a run through. I tried it yesterday, I
 wasn't getting too much in the way of results. I
 will give it a try today.
01 13 07 02 CC Okay. And on the - your tracking that we have
 now, it still looks like the time we gave you last
 night for time of pericynthian is still good, 69 plus
 10 and right now your flyby earth pericynthian
 altitude is 65.8. Looks like the midcourse number
 3 is going to be something less than 1 foot-per-second.
 And all trajectory parameters are still
 holding real fine.
01 13 07 36 CDR That's the things we like to hear. We would like
 to keep those holding very much.

Tape 26
Page 4
01 13 07 45 CC Roger.
01 13 21 00 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
01 13 21 04 CC Go ahead.
01 13 21 08 CDR Roger. We're getting near - we're going to need
 to dump some urine overboard here. I wonder if
 that's going to foul your trajectory up. Or can
 we go ahead and do it?
01 13 21 18 CC No, that's okay. Something that is kind of
 interesting though is that the last time you had
 your water dump, they noticed a change in the
 trajectory tracking at the same time and they got
 through correlating it, they found some fellow
 that thought he knew the characteristics of a
 nozzle and how much water you're dumping and his
 estimates of the effect on the trajectory seemed
 to coincide with the tracked results. So I guess
 you have to stay onto some of those things.
01 13 21 51 CDR Roger. Okay. We'll go ahead and dump it.
01 13 21 55 CC Okay.
01 13 23 29 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 13 23 31 CC Roger. Go ahead.
01 13 23 35 CMP You planning on using our computer any time in
 the near future, I thought I'd do a little P37.
01 13 24 50 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You can go ahead and run that
 37 and we'll going to kind of watch that from the
 ground, too, and see how it works out. A couple

Tape 26
Page 5
 of items that are just of general interest in
 the trajectory world. Looks like the uncertainty
 in position was about 12 miles. Your uncertainty
 in velocity is about a quarter of a foot per
 second. And the perigee altitude of uncertainty
 is 5 miles.
01 13 25 26 CMP Roger. Understand. Just for information, perhaps
 you read it out on the ground. I ran our pericynthian
 altitude determination using first of all,
 P21. The star state vector that we navigated with,
 we have plus 84.7 mile altitude and then we ran
 out your state vector that you updated with us the
 last time. We got 64.2 and then I ran P30, using
 our state vector and got 82.6 nautical miles.
 These are all plus.
01 13 26 02 CC That's good.
01 13 26 14 CMP What I'm going to attempt to do on P37 is to
 input your DELTA-V on your TLI plus 44 and use that
 44 burn time. I notice that the entry velocity
 is a little high. We might not be able to do a
 normal P37, but we'll give it a try.
01 13 26 35 CC Roger.
01 13 27 36 CMP Houston, one more question then before I start.
 Did you notice on this last update PAD, this
 minus MA NC-1. Was that referring to the P37 fast
 return or the nominal maneuver which you gave me?

Tape 26
Page 6
01 13 27 52 CC Apollo 8, that's referring to the fast return
 procedures.
01 13 27 58 LMP Okay. Thank you.
01 13 31 55 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 13 31 57 CC Go ahead.
01 13 32 00 CMP Are you following my procedure?
01 13 32 02 CC That's affirmative.
01 13 32 06 CMP Okay. This happened yesterday, too. I'm trying
 to load the DELTA-V you gave us in the maneuver
 TLI plus 44 in P37, but I keep getting an operator
 error everytime I try to load zeros for the
 termination of the middle and corner. Do you
 know what I'm doing wrong in my procedure?
01 13 32 31 CC Okay. Stand by.
01 13 35 24 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 13 35 28 CMP Okay, go ahead. I can take it.
01 13 35 31 CC Okay, looks like the decimal point in R2 under
 NOUN 60 is on the extreme right-hand side so the
 proper load will be 06070. Over.
01 13 35 46 CMP Ah, so. Okay, fine. Thank you. I'll update
 my checklist. Don't know what I want to update
 it for, I can't read.
01 13 54 24 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We are about to hand over
 to another site so you may lose lock momentarily.
01 13 54 36 CMP Roger, Houston. Did you receive the results of
 the P37?

Tape 26
Page 7
01 13 54 40 CC Sure did. Looks pretty good here.
01 13 54 45 CMP I concur.

 switch is completed.
01 13 57 19 CT You are loud and clear.
01 13 57 21 CC Roger.
01 13 58 23 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 13 58 25 CC Go ahead.
01 13 58 28 CMP Another comment on the optics. We're in PTC
 right now. We are passing the - we have the
 roll of about 182; we're about in 226 pitch and
 18 in yaw. I can rotate the shaft all the way
 around at this particular attitude, and I get
 this band of light at about 10 degrees of this
 side of the M-line. It - it varies in intensity
 with the shaft position. However, it is there
 at this particular attitude.
01 13 59 06 CC Okay. Thank you.
01 13 59 32 CC Jim, we have just been looking at your marks
 with respect to accuracy and they figure they
 are within a couple of thousandths of a degree
 of the theoretical optimum. The integrator seems
 to bear that out.
01 13 59 53 CMP Well, I hope that they are enough to get us home
 if we have to use them.
01 13 59 57 CC Well, I am getting a lot of confidence in your
 ability to run that mystery show now.
01 14 00 06 LMP We have to spend four more days up
 here with him, will you take it easy. He is

 already talking about going back to MIT as a professor.
01 14 00 08 CC (Laughter)
01 14 41 37 CDR Hello, Houston. How do you read Apollo 8?
01 14 41 40 CC Oh, loud and clear.
01 14 41 45 CC You sure do sound wide awake.
01 14 42 34 CDR Hello, Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
01 14 42 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
 How me?
01 14 44 05 CC Honeysuckle network, GOSS CONFERENCE. How do
 you read?
01 14 44 07 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8. How do you read?
01 14 44 11 CC Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
01 14 44 53 CT Go ahead Honeysuckle. How do you read?
01 14 45 03 CT Well, I would like to say hello to all of you
 in Australia. How is everything down there?
01 14 45 18 CT Pretty good so far. Thank you.
01 14 45 27 CT Honeysuckle, Houston network, on GOSS CONFERENCE.
 How do you read?
01 14 45 33 CT Houston network, this is Honeysuckle reading at

01 14 47 21 CDR Roger, just checking with you. Hey, if you all
 start having ground switching problems, how about
 having some place that has COMM come in and tell
 us about it. Will you please?
01 14 47 35 CC Roger. Apollo 8. That's what we have been trying
 to do. Some of our problem seems to be getting
 from here to that site.
01 14 47 42 CDR Houston. Apollo 8. How do you read?
01 14 47 45 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear. How me?
01 14 47 59 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
01 14 48 03 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
01 14 48 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 14 48 40 CDR Roger. Go ahead Houston. Apollo 8.
01 14 48 43 CC Roger. We read you loud and clear and copy your
 remarks about having our remote site talk to you.
 Some of our problem has been in going from MCC
 to the remote site. We will attempt to do that
 anytime we can.
01 14 49 01 CDR That's right. Just tell them you are having
 problems.
01 14 49 04 CC Roger.

01 15 38 02 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
01 15 38 06 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Reading you weak but clear.
01 15 38 11 CDR Okay. Thank you, Jerry.
01 16 02 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
01 16 02 20 CDR Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
01 16 02 22 CC Roger, Frank. I've got a little news and some
 ball scores if you want them.
01 16 02 28 CDR Go ahead.
01 16 02 29 CC Okay. The big news right now, on the wires, is
 that all 82 crewmen of the Pueblo have been returned.
 They walked across the Bridge of Freedom
 Monday night.
01 16 02 42 CDR Wonderful!
01 16 02 48 CC Said it took about 30 minutes for all 82 men
 to come across the Bridge of No Return and that's
 the one separating North and South Korea. They
 started across about 11:30 a.m. and were over
 by about noon, and they brought the body of the
 crewman that was killed, also.
01 16 03 17 CC Okay, Frank. On ball scores, did you get the
 word on the Baltimore and Minnesota game today?
01 16 03 24 CDR Not the final one.
01 16 03 26 CC Okay. Final score was the Colts 24, Vikings 14.
 That gives them the western conference, so it
 looks like for the NFL title it's gonna be the
 Browns versus the Colts on the 29th.

Tape 28
Page 2
01 16 03 41 CDR 29th?
01 16 03 44 CC Roger. Slow return - you'll get it.
01 16 03 49 CDR Say again.
01 16 03 53 CC Roger. Come back slow return and we'll get it.
01 16 03 58 CDR I'd rather come back fast and watch it on television.
01 16 04 02 CC Atta boy! Let's see, for the AFL: the big game
 today was Oakland and Kansas City and Oakland
 dumped them 41 to 6, so it's looks the AFL title
 game will be the Raiders and Jets.
01 16 04 17 CDR Righto! That's hard to believe, that score.
01 16 04 20 CC Amen! Okay. In yesterday's game, I don't know
 it you got the score on that. The Cleveland
 Browns and the Cowboys. The Browns dumped the
 Cowboys 31 to 20.
01 16 04 34 CDR Yes, we heard that.
01 16 04 36 CC Yes, they're crying in Dallas. Basketball scores:
 Houston didn't do so good this weekend. Illinois
 beat Houston 97 to 84. And North Carolina took
 the Owls. The score was 85 to 77. We had a
 couple of words in the paper, Frank, on the
 Oilers. The Oilers voted George Webster their
 most valuable player and - although Houston didn't
 make anybody on the All Offensive Team this year,
 they put Walt Suggs and Hoyle Granger on the
 second team.

Tape 28
Page 3
01 16 05 40 CDR Very good.
01 16 05 48 CC But although the Oilers didn't do so well out on
 the field, they did great in the box office.
 Bud Adams, Don Klausterman and Wally Lemm were
 all - real pleased with it. By the way, they
 were at the Cape to watch the show. Houston in
 11 games - the Oilers attracted 460 628 people.
01 16 06 12 CDR That must be a record? For them? I don't
 believe they ever got that many in Rice Stadium.
01 16 06 23 CC I think so. Let's see the regular season attendance
 was about half that. This includes all
 the exhibition games. The paper says they averaged
 about 40 480 for the league games.
01 16 06 38 CDR Great!
01 16 06 45 CC Well, that's about it for now, Frank. We got
 some more news that they promised they would
 bring over as soon as it comes off the wire.
 The only thing of real interests were - particularly
 the Pueblo release. I think you've already
 been told about the - Nixon-Eisenhower wedding.
 And about the only other thing is the weather
 which is pretty clear around here. We've got
 high overcasts. But it is cold, good visibility,
 and it's beginning to feel like winter again.
01 16 07 20 CDR Good time for Christmas, good weather for Christmas.
01 16 07 37 CC Who have you got up now, Frank?

Tape 28
Page 11
01 16 07 41 CDR The other two guys are pretty sleepy. They
 sacked out again. So I am holding the fort
 down for a while.

01 16 07 48 CC Okay. Thanks.
01 16 07 52 CDR Roger. Thank you.
01 16 08 00 CC Frank, we had a little egg nog over at Charlie
 Duke's tonight.
01 16 08 03 CDR Say again.
01 16 08 04 CC We had a little egg nog at Charlie Duke's tonight.
 Val Anders dropped by. She's looking fine.
 Tell Bill she's doing real fine.
01 16 08 14 CDR Fine.
01 16 08 43 CDR How do you like shift work, Jerry?
01 16 08 51 CC It's great Frank. You've got the black watch
 watching you tonight.
01 16 08 56 CDR Yes, that's what I figured.
01 16 11 17 CDR Boy, Jerry. That earth is sure looking small.
01 16 11 25 CC Roger. I guess it'll get smaller, too.
01 16 11 33 CDR Yes, we're getting along pretty good, though, now.
01 16 11 36 CC Real good. It looks like you're approaching
 150 000 miles.
01 16 11 42 CDR Roger.
01 16 11 48 CC How does the moon look, Frank?
01 16 11 52 CDR Say again.
01 16 11 53 CC Have you looked at the moon lately?
01 16 11 57 CDR No. I saw it yesterday, but we haven't seen it
 today.

Tape 28
Page 5
01 16 12 51 CC Frank, you've probably already been told this,
 but you looked great on TV today. One little
 homey item, though. In the El Lago area you were
 upstaged by Santa Claus. He came along on a
 fire engine just about the time you guys came
 along. So most of the little critters were all
 outside.
01 16 13 10 CDR That's good. I wish we could have got that one
 lens working. I'd like to share the view here
 we have of the earth.
01 16 13 20 CC Frank, we've got some guys looking at it. We
 might be able to find a way to make it work for
 you. Hopefully, by a couple of hours before
 TV time tomorrow, we'll have an answer.
01 16 13 31 CDR Very good.
01 16 13 32 CC Jack Schmitt is working with us, too.
01 16 13 39 CDR Very good.
01 16 13 41 CC Ah, Jack Schmitt's working with it, too.
01 16 13 43 CDR Very good. That's Typhoid Jack.
01 16 13 44 CC (Laughter)
01 16 14 06 CDR This COMM so good we don't figure we'll
 have much to debrief.
01 16 14 13 CC Roger. Probably the biggest part of the
 debrief will be the medical part.
01 16 14 26 CDR Roger. You're sure right. Oh, we're all in
 fine shape.

Tape 28
Page 6
01 16 14 45 CC Real fine, Frank.
01 16 48 42 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. We have just completed the
 canister change.
01 16 48 47 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Copy.

01 17 37 31 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 17 37 36 CDR Go ahead.
01 17 37 37 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. We have a handover
 coming up in 2-1/2 minutes to Guam. Over.
01 17 37 44 CDR Okay, Jerry. Thank you. Hey, Jerry?
01 17 37 52 CC Go ahead.
01 17 37 55 CDR How about a long-range guess on what the weather
 is going to be like in the recovery area on Friday.
01 17 38 03 CC Roger, Frank.
01 17 44 52 CC Apollo 8, Houston, with a weather watch.
01 17 45 02 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
01 17 45 04 CC Roger, Frank. For 7 degrees, 38 minutes north,
 165 west landing area, we are showing 2000
 scattered, 12 000 broken, high over at 10; the
 wind's from the east at 12, 4-foot swells, about
 an 82 degree temperature. There will be some
 rain showers in about 10 to 30 percent of the
 area with ceilings around 2000. If there is -
 turns out to be a thunderstorm in the area, it
 will probably have a ceiling around 500 feet.
01 17 47 02 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Did you copy that weather okay?
01 17 47 05 CDR Roger. I said thank you. Do you read me now?
01 17 47 07 CC Roger. Reading you much better. We got the voice
 coming down through Honeysuckle now.
01 17 47 14 CDR Okay.

Tape 29

01 17 58 23 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 17 58 27 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
01 17 58 29 CC Roger, Frank. Can you cycle the H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> cryo
 fans now for us?
01 17 58 38 CDR Roger. Will turn her now, the H<sub>2</sub>. Manual -
 2 minutes.
01 17 58 44 CC Roger.
01 17 58 55 CDR You may need to call us now and then. Everybody
 is a little drowsy.
01 17 59 01 CC Okay, Frank.
01 18 07 07 CDR That completes it, Jerry. They're all cycled
 through.
01 18 07 11 CC Roger, Frank.
01 18 07 21 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
01 18 07 23 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.
01 18 07 28 CDR Did you get my message about the fans?
01 18 07 31 CC Sure did, Frank. Thanks.
01 18 07 35 CDR Okay.
END OF TAPE

01 18 44 47 CDR Houston. Apollo 8.
01 18 44 52 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
01 18 45 00 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
01 18 45 04 CDR Roger. The cabin temperature is down to
 60, and it's getting pretty chilly in here.
 Have you got any approved solutions on how to
 bring it up without stirring up this nice
 thermal balance we have?
01 18 45 15 CC Roger. Stand by.
01 18 46 01 CC Frank, do you have your cabin fans on?
01 18 46 05 CDR Negative.
01 18 46 06 CC Roger.
01118 46 08 CDR We haven't had them on since we separated.
01 18 46 14 CC Okay.
01 18 46 22 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 18 56 26 CDR Go ahead.
01 18 56 28 CC Roger, Frank. Midcourse number 3 looks like
 just a shade more than 1 foot per second, so
 we don't recommend that you do it. That leads
 us off into a midcourse 4 of only about 3 feet
 per second right now. Your trajectory is looking
 real good. Your height at pericynthian is
 70 miles.
01 18 56 53 CDR Roger. Understand. Thank you.
01 18 56 55 CC Roger. Roger, Frank. Little few thoughts on
 what is coming up now. The star sightings when

Tape 30
Page 2
 Jim gets up; looks right now like we've had
 enough of the earth horizon, and everything
 looks real good; and we are ready to start on
 some lunar horizon sightings. So when Jim gets
 up, we will pass the flight plan update to him
 for a set of stars with the moon. Also, around 48,
 or after the star sightings is when we would like
 to see your next water dump come up. So, if you
 can, I recommend you get a little shuteye.
01 18 57 36 CDR Roger. Have you got any answer about warming this
 place up a little bit?
01 18 57 40 CC Roger. They are still cranking around. They are
 talking about cabin fans, but that sounds like
 sort of a noisy proposition.
01 19 05 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 19 05 21 CMP Go ahead.
01 19 05 23 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. I have got two
 methods for you to warm up the cabin there.
 The first one is a one-man job - about the
 best way would be to put one or both cabin fans ON
 and go full hot on the cabin heat exchanger.
 It'll be a fairly slow process of warming up,
 and you won't get a whole lot of heating. Your
 second method would be to adjust with the mixing
 valve your radiator OUT temperatures. This, again,
 is a two-man job, and you have to be pretty careful.

Tape 30
Page 3
01 19 06 03 CMP Roger. Well, Frank just went to bed, and Bill
 isn't up yet. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll
 put on the fans and go HIGH on the cabin temperature
 and see what that does.
01 19 06 16 CC Okay, Jim. Remember, if you use just one fan,
 cover the other.
01 19 06 26 CMP Roger.
01 19 10 22 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 19 10 25 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
01 19 10 30 CMP Roger. If I use just one fan - You mentioned
 about covering the other one - are you sure
 that's true in this spacecraft?
01 19 10 43 CC Roger. That's affirmative.
01 19 10 49 CMP I thought that was a BLOCK I problem.
01 19 11 01 CC Stand by, Jim. We'll recheck on that one.
01 19 11 16 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Did you get the word from
 Frank on the star-sighting plans?
01 19 11 25 CMP Roger. I'll get out the flight plan if you
 have an update to it now, though, then we can
 update it right now.
01 19 11 32 CC Okay.
01 19 28 42 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 19 29 07 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 19 29 11 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
01 19 29 14 CC Roger. Are you ready for that flight plan
 update?

Tape 30
Page 4
01 19 29 21 CMP Roger. Go ahead.
01 19 29 23 CC Okay. At 47:15, delete the P23 sightings
 you're shoving there; and at 45 minutes -
 correction, 45 hours, add one additional
 set of sightings to each star.
01 19 29 52 CMP Okay. You said at 45 hours we're going to
 add one set of sightings to each of the three
 stars. Is that correct?
01 19 29 58 CC That's affirmative. Everybody's real pleased
 with the earth horizon work; and as far as
 we're concerned, you can knock that off, and
 just add one set to each one of your lunar
 horizon stars at about 45. This 45-hour time
 also is not hard. You can shift it as your -
 as you desire.
01 19 30 25 CMP Roger. I see things coming up now. Jerry,
 we're going to get the block data around 44,
 and we'll do alignment around 44:30 and then
 we'll go into cislunar navigation.
01 19 30 39 CC Okay. Fine, Jim. Then remember after you do
 the sightings, we'll want you to go back to
 the PTC mode again. And a little curiosity,
 how's the water tasting, and how did you sleep?
01 19 30 57 CMP Water's tasting okay; no problems. And the
 sleep is getting better: We find it better to
 sleep underneath the couch now. I was up here

Tape 30
Page 5
 with Frank, and I was dozing off periodically
 over the last several hours. Frank's now below
 and Bill's below, too.
01 19 31 17 CC Okay, Jim; thanks.
01 19 37 27 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 19 37 31 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
01 19 37 32 CC Apollo 8, we've got a command handover from
 Guam to Honeysuckle coming up in about 2 and
 1/2 minutes.
01 19 37 43 CMP Roger.
01 19 39 22 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 19 39 27 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8. This is Flight -
01 19 39 33 CMP ... at this distance --
01 19 39 38 CC Say again, Apollo 8.
01 19 39 39 CMP ... at this distance, there is no problem -
 there is no problem in seeing stars in the
 daylight at this distance.
01 19 39 53 CC Roger. Copy.
01 19 40 23 CC Apollo 8, Flight.
01 19 40 27 CMP This is 8; go ahead.
01 19 40 29 CC Jim, are you talking about out the window or
 out any of the - or out the telescope?
01 19 40 36 CMP I am looking out the window right now. I have
 the lights out in the spacecraft, the window
 covered where the sun is, and I can see the
 stars very well out the left rendezvous window.

Tape 30
Page 6
01 19 40 49 CC Okay. I guess that window is still pretty good
 for you then.
01 19 40 55 CMP That's right. It is one of the few that is.
 The center window, unfortunately, is all fogged
 over; it looks like a coating of ice or coating
 of heavy fog. Bill claims it is something else,
 though.
01 19 41 12 CC Roger. By the way, I am just getting OJT on
 this CAP COM job while Jerry is out of the
 room.
01 19 41 25 CMP Well, we all have to learn sometime.
01 19 41 31 CC Yes sir.
01 19 41 47 CMP You picked a midnight shift, I see.
01 19 41 50 CC Yes, it is turning out to be kind of quiet,
 too.
01 19 41 57 CMP We like it that way.
01 19 42 00 CC Well, things will pick up here by tomorrow
 night, I think.
01 19 42 05 CMP I believe you are right.
01 19 42 14 CC We're starting to show cabin temperature at
 70, so it may be warming up for you.
01 19 42 21 CMP Well, we can feel it warm up. I have both
 fans on and the - our gages indicate about 70.
01 19 42 28 CC Okay. And I have got a real CAP COM back
 now.
01 19 53 47 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 19 53 52 CMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.

01 21 14 55 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
01 21 15 00 CMP Roger. Just some interesting things on the -
 just done a NAV with the moon; the sun is currently
 right in the way. I managed to get
 one set on Antares and was working on the
 second set, and the rim of the moon just disappeared
 completely. The view through the
 sextant is a milky white, whether you're looking
 at black sky or the moon. The tint of
 the moon is slightly washed out by the brightness
 of the sun. I'll try the next star and
 see what I can do with it.
01 21 15 35 CC Roger, Jim.
01 21 15 56 LMP Good morning, Houston. How are the systems
 looking here lately?
01 21 16 02 CC Mornin', sleepy head. Systems are looking
 GO.
01 21 16 11 LMP Thank you.
01 21 16 34 CC How'd you sleep, Bill?
01 21 16 41 LMP Oh, off and on, Jerry. There was quite a
 bit of noise in here, and anytime somebody
 responds to a transmission, why, it tends to
 wake you up. But it was a reasonably good
 rest.
01 21 16 54 CC Real fine. We got a little work scheduled
 for you here. We've got an ECS redundant

Tape 31
Page 2
 component check to run and some fuel cell
 purging to do.
01 21 17 06 LMP Okay. How about if we wait until this NAV
 exercise is over with?
01 21 17 11 CC Roger.
01 21 18 23 CC Bill, what we have planned for you right
 after Jim gets finished is a waste water dump,
 a cryo fan cycle, redundant component check,
 and a fuel cell purge.
01 21 18 31 LMP Roger.
01 21 18 40 CC We'll be wanting an O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge;
 we'll give you a 20-minute hack on the heater.
01 21 18 51 LMP Okay. Want me to turn them on now or when
 you give me a hack?
01 21 18 56 CC You better wait about 20 minutes.
01 21 19 01 LMP Okay.
01 21 25 13 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Bill, are you still
 eating?
01 21 25 21 LMP Doing what?
01 21 25 25 CC Are you busy eating?
01 21 25 26 LMP Negative. I'm watching the store while Jim
 does his NAV sighting and then recording the
 data for him.
01 21 25 33 CC Okay. We have a correction to make to your
 TLI plus 44 hour PAD. If you've got a chance
 there, we'd like to fire it on up to you.

Tape 31

01 21 25 47 LMP Stand by.
01 21 25 50 CC Roger.
01 21 26 17 LMP Okay. Ready to copy the correction to TLI
 plus 44.
01 21 26 24 CC Roger. The correction is in the remarks at
 the end. Delete the reference to high speed
 procedure minus MA.
01 21 26 42 LMP Roger. Delete minus MA slash NC-1, Charlie.
01 21 26 49 CC That's affirmative, and copy the following.
 This comment should read use P37 NC-4, step 1
 through 11. Over.
01 21 27 15 LMP Roger. Use P37 NC-4, steps 1 through 11.
01 21 27 22 CC Roger. Then proceed to longitude control for
 no COMM procedure, page NC-7.
01 21 27 46 LMP You went a little fast. Say again the page.
01 21 27 49 CC Roger, That page is NC-7. I'll read that
 again. Then proceed to longitude control for
 no COMM procedure, page NC-7. Average 400k,
 V 400K, for corridor control charts is 36253.
 I repeat, average V 400K for corridor control
 charts is 36253. Over.

 abort when the GERU is less than 07990.
01 21 30 08 LMP Roger. Minus MA procedure okay for abort
 when GERU less than 07990.
01 21 30 20 CC Roger. I'll read back the entire remarks
 now just to make sure we got it straight.
 Use P37 NC-4, steps 1 through 11; then proceed

01 21 42 31 CC Bill, you can turn on the H<sub>2</sub> purge line heater
 now.
01 21 42 36 LMP Okay.
01 21 47 41 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 21 47 47 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
01 21 47 49 CC Jim, when you get a chance, either you or Bill,
 would you give us a crew status report on you

 We think it was 12020.
---- CC Roger. Copy.
---- LMP Okay. That completes two for this time, Houston.
 Are you satisfied?
---- CC Roger, Jim.
---- CMP Houston, for information, the last two stars,
 34 and 40, were shot at the very tip of the lit
 rim. You practically have to imagine the rim
 continued on past where it goes into the darkness.
---- CC Roger. I understand they were shot at the tip
 of the lit rim.
---- CMP That's affirmative, and the area around the entire
 moon now, both the sky and the moon itself, are all
 a milky white because of the nearness of the sun.
---- CC Roger. Copying.
01 21 53 42 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You can reestablish PTC same
 attitude, 224 and 20.

01 22 01 39 CC We'd like to have you start your waste water dump
 as soon as you can; dump to 20 percent. We're
 doing this in order to get 71 percent at LOI.
 Over.
01 22 01 55 LMP Understand; 20 percent.
01 22 01 58 CC Roger.
01 22 14 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 22 14 36 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
01 22 14 38 CC Roger. We see waste water coming down now. While
 it's on its way down, how about a cryo fan cycle?
01 22 14 48 CMP Okay. Cryo fan cycle; I'll cycle H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> fans,
 one at a time, 2 minutes each.
01 22 14 56 CC Roger.
01 22 21 56 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're showing you at 20.0 percent now.
01 22 22 07 LMP Roger. We're showing about 25. We'll shut it off
 now.
01 22 22 12 CC Roger. Next on deck is the fuel cell H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> purge.
01 22 22 21 LMP Stand by.
01 22 30 34 LMP Okay. Houston, we're ready to start the purge.
01 22 30 38 CC Roger, Bill. While you're purging, can you give
 us a crew status report?
01 22 30 49 LMP That's going to be O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>. Is that correct?
01 22 30 52 CC Affirmative.
01 22 31 LMP Roger. H<sub>2</sub> first, okay?
01 22 31 07 CC Roger. That's okay.

Tape 32

01 22 32 13 LMP We're getting H<sub>2</sub> flow, Jerry, but we don't have
 any of the - any vapor particles anywhere. Some
 are starting now.
01 22 32 33 CC Roger. We confirm your flow and understand you're
 seeing particles now.
01 22 32 42 LMP Not much, though. Okay. Now going to number 2.
01 22 32 45 CC Roger.
01 22 33 08 LMP You know, it's really too bad the side windows
 are fogged up because we never see any sun in the
 rendezvous windows, and we can't get very good
 pictures through these foggy ones.
01 22 33 22 CC Roger.
01 22 34 36 LMP Start number 3. H<sub>2</sub>.
01 22 36 21 LMP Okay. Start number 3, O<sub>2</sub>.
01 22 36 28 CC Roger, Apollo 8. Apollo 8, this is Houston.
 Would you set for ACCEPT for a P27 update, state
 vector to your LM side, and we'd like you to -
01 22 36 46 LMP Say again.
01 22 36 48 CC Roger, Bill. Would you set up to ACCEPT a state
 vector update? We'll be putting it in the LM
 slot, and do not unzap. Over.
01 22 37 02 LMP Roger. NORMAL ACCEPT.

01 22 38 27 It might be interesting to note that after NAV
 sightings, we ran out P21, and we get a pericynthian
 now of 66.8 miles.
01 22 38 38 CC Roger, 8. We copy.
01 22 38 45 LMP I knew if he did it long enough, he'd finally
 get one that was close.
01 22 39 13 LMP Okay. Start fuel cell 2.
01 22 39 18 CC Roger.
01 22 39 54 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Your state vector update is

 still getting pretty good high bit rate off the
 30-foot dishes.
01 22 43 13 LMP Okay. I'm in NARROW BEAM high gain now. Were
 you getting good high bit rate on the OMNI?
01 22 43 26 CC That's affirmative. We're back on high gain now.

Tape 32
Page 5
01 22 43 39 LMP Okay. Number 1 O<sub>2</sub> is off, and will you clarify
 your previous statement. Were you getting good
 high bit rate while we were on the OMNI's about
 10 minutes ago? Over.
01 22 43 50 CC Apollo 8, Houston. That's affirmative. We were
 getting fairly good high bit rate with a little
 bit of noise.
01 22 43 59 LMP Okay. Thank you.
01 22 44 02 CC Roger. We only got two things left to do now.
 We need your crew status report and a redundant
 component check.
01 22 44 13 LMP Jim will give you the latter - former,
 and I'll give you the latter.
01 22 44 20 CC Okay.
01 22 44 42 CC Bill, EECOM says thanks for the good job on keeping
 the OMNI's moving.
01 22 44 54 LMP Roger. We'll make any sacrifice as long as they
 keep an eye on the systems.
01 22 45 03 CC Wilco.
01 22 45 10 LMP Who's on the watch with you?
01 22 45 15 CC It's just me right now.
01 22 45 20 LMP How about EECOM?
01 22 45 22 CC Well, we have Clint. The Black Watch is watching.
01 22 45 32 LMP Okay. Stay alert.
01 22 45 34 CC Roger. The Black Watch is watching.
01 22 45 35 LMP Roger. I'll stay alert.

01 22 46 35 CMP Okay, Houston. Here comes the status report.
01 22 46 42 CC Roger. We're ready to copy.
01 22 46 46 CMP Roger. For sleep, each of us has had two sleep
 periods; Frank's in his third one right now.
 Bill had 6 hours the last time; I had 4 hours
 the last time. Good to fair, both of us. Frank
 had 5 hours the last time, of fair. And Frank,
 of course, is sleeping now.
01 22 47 18 CC Roger, Jim. How are the three of you feeling?
01 22 47 24 CMP We're all feeling pretty good now; no problems.
 We've all had about between 40 and 60 ounces
 of - or clicks of water so far today.
01 22 47 38 CC Okay.
01 22 47 43 CMP The food: we're up to - we've eaten day 2,
 meal 2 so far. And both of us have eaten the
 rehydratables and the juices and about half of
 the solids.
01 22 48 07 CC Roger. Copy.
01 22 48 15 CMP The cabin's running slightly cold. We do have
 one cabin fan ON, and we're in full heat, and
 it's running just slightly under 70. Might be
 a design note for future spacecraft.
01 22 48 31 CC Roger, Jim. That fan pretty noisy?
01 22 48 37 CMP It's not as noisy as both fans when they're running;
 we cut it down to one fan.
01 22 48 43 CC Roger. We keep thinking we hear it when you're
 talking to us.

Tape 32
Page 7
01 22 48 50 CMP I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
01 22 48 56 LMP Houston, we're showing a glycol EVAP OUT TEMP
 around 44, and a RAD OUT TEMP of about 28. I
 wonder if we might try some manual mixing here
 to raise the glycol EVAP TEMP OUT a little bit?
01 22 49 26 CC Roger, Bill. Stand by.
01 22 54 15 LMP Okay. Houston, second loop is coming up.
01 22 54 19 CC Roger, Bill.
01 22 55 16 LMP Okay. We're boiling the secondary EVAP, and the
 temperature's stabilized, and so we're gonna close
 up the EVAP pressure valve.
01 22 55 25 CC Roger. Copy.
01 22 56 33 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
01 22 56 37 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
01 22 56 39 CC Roger, Bill. Before you try the manual mixing,
 we'd like you to give it a whirl at the manual
 and increase on the cabin TEMP. Over.
01 22 56 52 LMP We've done that. We're in full HOT, and what
 is your - what's the lowest RAD OUT - individual
 RAD OUT TEMP you seen here during our PTC?
01 22 57 10 CC Roger. Stand by.
01 22 57 36 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. We saw 26 one time.
01 22 57 45 LMP Roger. Understand; plus 26.
01 22 57 50 CC Affirmative.
01 22 58 22 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead with your manual
 mixing. Suggest you set your EVAP OUT at about
 55. Over.

Tape 32
Page 8
01 22 58 33 LMP Okay. We'll give that a try, and let us know
 if the RAD OUT TEMPs get too low.
01 22 58 38 CC Roger. We're monitoring.
01 23 10 18 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 23 10 21 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
01 23 10 26 LMP Roger. We have it stabilized about 53 degrees,
 and we will leave it there, but we will go back
 AUTO if you start having any concern about the
 radiators.
01 23 10 39 CC Roger, Bill. We are showing 51.4 here.
01 23 10 46 LMP Okay.
01 23 23 00 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are going to have
 a command changeover to Honeysuckle in about
 2 minutes. Over.
01 23 23 08 CMP Roger, Houston. Standing by.
01 23 23 13 CC Apollo 8, Houston. That was Honeysuckle to Madrid.
01 23 23 21 CMP Si, senor.
01 23 23 27 LMP Goodby, you chaps.
01 23 24 34 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 23 24 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
01 23 24 40 CMP Roger. Did you delete the cislunar NAV exercise
 at 47:15?
01 23 24 46 CC That's affirmative, and we added the extra star
 sightings to the one at 45.
01 23 27 43 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
01 23 27 48 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Buenas dias, muchachos.

Tape 32
Page 9
01 23 27 53 LMP Buenas dias. We're going to be answering your
 calls pretty quietly for a little while here to
 let the CDR get to sleep. If you can't hear us,
 why, just tell us so.
01 23 28 09 CC Okay.

01 23 33 24 LMP Roger. My two cohorts are going to try and get
 some sleep here, so y'all might keep a good eye
 on the systems. I'm going to move over to the
 other side.
01 23 33 35 CC Roger.
01 23 34 24 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're getting low bit rate now.
 We could do better with a high-gain antenna
 before you move over to the other side. Over.
01 23 34 36 LMP Roger.
01 23 40 49 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
01 23 40 52 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
01 23 40 57 LMP You might give me a call every now and then,
 Jerry, just to let me know you're still there,
 as we're switching antennas, or play some music
 or something.
01 23 41 10 CC Say again, Bill. You're kind of garbled.
01 23 41 15 LMP I say you might just give me a call every now and
 then as we switch antennas, just to let me
 know you're still there, or play some music
 or something, just to make sure we haven't
 lost COMM.
01 23 41 29 CC Okay, Bill.  Your antennas are looking good now.
01 23 42 03 CC Hey, Bill. If you want music, I'll have Mike sing.

Tape 33
Page 2
01 23 42 11 LMP Ask him to sing "Anchors Aweigh", will you?
02 00 07 45 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 00 07 51 LMP Roger.
02 00 07 53 CC On your secondary coolant loop, looks like
 your back-pressure valve might be slightly
 open. I suggest you go to secondary coolant
 loop EVAP switch to the RESET position for
 58 seconds. Over.
02 00 08 12 LMP Roger. I did that again; I'll try it a third
 time.
02 00 08 14 CC Okay.
02 00 10 04 LMP That didn't do it any good, Houston.
02 00 10 07 CC Roger, Bill.
02 00 10 18 LMP Keep an eye on it, in case it starts dropping.
 It stabilized there right after I shut the evaporator
 off.
02 00 10 24 CC Roger. We will watch it.
02 00 11 06 LMP What might have happened, Jim might have gotten
 the water control valve off before we completely
 had the back-pressure valve closed.
02 00 11 20 CC Roger. Understand Jim turned the water control
 valve off.
02 00 11 28 LMP Roger. We have the secondary water EVAP control
 valve off, but he might have gotten it off on
 that return pump chart check prior to the time
 the evaporator back-pressure valve had completely

Tape 33
Page 3
 closed, which might explain its lower-than-nominal
 state pressure.
02 00 11 46 CC Roger. Understand.
02 00 30 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
02 00 30 23 LMP Go ahead.
02 00 30 24 CC Roger, Bill. We see your secondary steam pressure
 coming back up slowly, and we would like to just
 sit and watch it for a while before doing anything
 else.
02 00 30 36 LMP Okay.

02 01 16 34 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 01 17 07 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
02 01 17 13 LMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
02 01 17 15 CC Roger. I just wanted to let you know we still
 have voice contact, and we have the morning news
 for you. We can give it to you now or some time
 later, your choice.
02 01 17 27 LMP How about right now?
02 01 17 29 CC Very good. This is the 23rd of December edition of
 the Interstellar Times a la Paul Haney. We would
 like to let you know that there are only 2 more
 shopping days until Christmas. He says your TV
 transmission was a real big hit yesterday. Mickey
 Herskowitz is doing double duty for the Post. He's
 written a couple of columns on your launch in addition
 to his other sports columns, and, Jim, your
 mom certainly appreciated that birthday greeting.
 Twenty-one convicts broke out of a prison in New
 Orleans yesterday, and President Johnson went home
 last night from Bethesda Naval Hospital after his
 bout with the flu. He sends you guys a special
 message - not what to do for the flu - but congratulations
 on the flight. Are you reading me so far
 okay?
02 01 18 25 LMP You're very clear, Mike.
02 01 18 27 CC Good. Well, we had a big blizzard down here in
 the midwest; I don't know if you can see that from

Tape 34
Page 2
 up there or not. And in Houston, as a matter
 of fact, it's getting pretty chilly, about
 35 degrees. And we would like to know who you
 like next Sunday, Baltimore or Cleveland? Baltimore
 defense looked pretty tremendous yesterday.
 They put on great pass rush, and it sounds to
 CAP COM like Haney is trying to con you guys
 into a bet. Over.
02 01 18 57 LMP I like Baltimore.
02 01 19 01 CC Are you giving points?
02 01 19 05 LMP Negative. I don't bet.
02 01 19 09 CC I guess you don't if you don't give points.
02 01 19 14 LMP Not with you anyway.
02 01 19 19 CC Okay. That's about the size of the news. Houston,
 standing by.
02 01 19 24 CDR How are the families doing, Mike?
02 01 19 29 CC They are doing just great, Bill; just talking to
 Valerie a few minutes ago.
02 01 19 37 CDR That was Frank.
02 01 19 40 CC Oh, well, likewise with Susan. I have not talked
 to her since last night.
02 01 19 48 CDR Roger.
02 01 21 16 CDR Mike, this is Frank again. Would you tell the
 doctors I got about 5 hours of good sleep yesterday?
02 01 21 21 CC Roger. Thank you, Frank; we were wondering about
 that, about 5 hours of good sleep.

Tape 34
Page 3
02 01 21 29 CDR Right.
02 01 21 37 CC How is everything going up there, Frank; all
 three of you guys feeling okay this morning?
02 01 21 43 CDR Feel fine. Jim went back to sleep. Bill and I
 are having breakfast and everything seems fine.
02 01 21 48 CC Good; glad to hear it.
02 02 07 18 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
02 02 07 23 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
02 02 07 24 CC Just checking in with you after about a 45 minute
 quiet break. Say, we notice on your high-gain
 antenna, if you like, you can get a little bit
 more use out of it by switching to it from OMNI
 when you have a yaw angle of 90 degrees and a
 pitch angle of minus 45 degrees. We are noticing
 that you are staying an extra 10 minutes on the
 OMNI, which is fine; but you could get more use
 out of the high gain if you use that procedure.
 Over.
02 02 08 00 CDR Okay, thank you. It's a lot simpler for us, as
 long as the OMNI isn't working. We've got it all
 wrapped up here on the eight ball with the roll ...
 pointing to an OMNI number. We just switch it;
 it makes it a lot easier, if it is not bothering
 you.
02 02 08 13 CC Okay. That is fine. We are presently happy with
 the COMM, Frank. We are just trying to be helpful.

Tape 34
Page 4
02 02 08 25 CDR Thank you very much. It's unusual that Mike
 Collins tries to be helpful, but nevertheless,
 thank you very much.
02 02 08 30 CC Good; aerospace first, Frank.
02 02 08 35 CDR Say hello to Howard Tindall for us, will you?
 His procedure seemed to be working.
02 02 08 39 CC Sure will.
02 02 08 59 CDR I hope that you have got everybody looking this
 thing over very carefully. One thing we want is
 a perfect spacecraft before we consider the LOI
 burn.
02 02 09 07 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We concur, and we are doing
 that.
02 02 09 13 CDR Okay.
02 02 09 55 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. The water is in the process
 of being chlorinated at this time.
02 02 09 59 CC Roger. Understand you're chlorinating the water
 at this time.
02 02 10 06 CDR Roger.
02 02 10 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
02 02 10 53 CDR Go ahead.
02 02 10 54 CC At your convenience, we would like the readout
 of your service module RCS propellant quantities.
 We haven't gotten one of those so far this flight.
02 02 11 04 CDR Alright. Stand by. We are just about to - need
 to change the antenna. I'll give them to you.

Tape 34
Page 5
02 02 12 14 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
02 02 12 18 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
02 02 12 25 CDR Okay. A, service module A, you ready?
02 02 12 30 CC Ready to copy.
02 02 12 34 CDR The temperature is about 111, the helium pressure
 - Do you just want the quantity, or do you
 want the whole works?
02 02 12 41 CC Well, if you are reading, give us the whole works.
02 02 12 46 CDR Okay. The helium pressure is about 37, the manifold
 is 182, and the quantity is reading 80. B
 has got the temperature about 112, the helium
 pressure about 36.5, the fuel pressure 180, and
 the quantity about 77. C has got the temperature
 of 140 - incidentally, those other temperatures
 should have been 120 instead of 110; I was looking
 at the wrong calibration here. The pressure is
 37, the manifold pressure is about 182, and the
 quantity is 80. Temperature on D is 115, pressure
 is 37, the manifold pressure is 181, and
 the quantity is about 83.
02 02 14 02 CC Roger, Frank. I read you loud and clear. On the
 temperatures, quad A and B should both be 120.
 Roger.
02 02 14 11 CDR Roger.
02 02 14 12 CC Thank you.

Tape 34
Page 6
02 02 14 36 CDR I will trade all of that good information for
 a readout of the actual quantities. If you will
 give us a minute, we will go ahead and plot them
 up, Mike.
02 02 14 45 CC Roger. We will stand by until we get them for you.
02 02 16 34 CC Apollo 8, Houston. I have your service module
 RCS quantities available. Over.
02 02 16 43 CDR Roger. We are ready to copy at 50 hours 16 minutes.
02 02 16 47 CC Okay. I have them both in percent and pounds;
 I'll give you both numbers. The pounds are
 slightly more accurate for plotting on your chart.
 Quad A 72 percent, 219 pounds; quad B 76 percent,
 233 pounds; quad C 70 --
02 02 17 10 CDR Take it a little slower, Mike; whoa, whoa, whoa
 whoa.
02 02 17 13 CC Okay.
02 02 17 15 CDR Slow up. We just got quad A plotted. They are
 on separate charts.
02 02 17 20 CC Okay.
02 02 17 22 CDR Okay for quad B.
02 02 17 24 CC Quad B 76 percent, 233 pounds.
02 02 17 34 CDR Okay. Quad C.
02 02 17 36 CC Seventy-six percent, 231 pounds.
02 02 17 49 CDR Quad D.
02 02 17 50 CC Seventy-six percent, 229 pounds.

Tape 34
Page 7
02 02 17 59 CDR Okay.
02 02 18 15 CDR Would you give us the O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> as long as we
 are plotting?
02 02 18 18 CC Roger. Stand by for O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>.
02 02 19 58 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We have got those numbers in
 a percent. We are going to switch them over to
 pounds, and in the meantime, we are going to be
 changing our ground antenna in about another
 2-1/2 minutes. You can expect a COMM glitch.
 Over.
02 02 20 14 CDR Thank you.
02 02 23 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
02 02 23 52 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
02 02 23 55 CC Roger. I have your oxygen and hydrogen quantities
 when you are ready to copy.
02 02 24 02 CDR Ready.
02 02 24 06 CC Oxygen tank number 1 270 pounds, 270; oxygen
 tank 2 267, 267 pounds. Over.
02 02 24 24 CDR Roger. Thank you.
02 02 24 26 CC Roger. On the hydrogen, hydrogen tank 1 19.7;
 hydrogen tank 2 20.1. Over.
02 02 24 41 CDR Understand; 19.7 and 20.1.
02 02 24 44 CC Roger. You are a little bit low on the line on
 your graph due to the fact that they started out
 low.
02 02 24 55 CDR Roger.
END OF TAPE

Tape 35
Page 1
02 02 54 46 CDR Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
02 02 54 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear. How me?
 Over.
02 02 54 54 CDR Loud and clear. I was just checking. Over.
02 02 54 57 CC Roger.
02 02 56 09 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
02 02 56 13 CDR Go ahead.
02 02 56 15 CC Roger, Frank. Your 51-hour update of block
 data will be omitted. The block data you have
 on board is satisfactory. Over.
02 02 56 28 CDR Understand. The block data we have aboard is
 satisfactory.
02 02 56 30 CC Right. That's for the flyby and pericynthian
 plus 2 hour block update. We would like also
 to get a current up-to-date report on all your
 windows. We are trying to make some alternate
 plans for using the center hatch window when
 you are in lunar orbit, and we would like to
 make sure we understand exactly what the condition
 of all five windows is. Over.
02 02 56 54 CDR Okay. Number - window number 1 and number 5 are
 clouded, but they may be partially useful. The
 hatch window is very badly clouded. Windows
 number 2 and 4 are good.
02 02 57 06 CC Okay. Understand the hatch window is unusable, 1
 and 5 are partially usable, and the rendezvous
 windows are both good.

Tape 35
Page 2
02 02 57 17 CDR Right.
02 02 57 18 CC Okay.
02 03 13 13 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
02 03 13 18 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
02 03 13 20 CC Roger, Frank. We would like to ask you about
 the next few hours in the flight plan. We are
 inclined to let Jim go ahead and sleep and to
 slip the P23 that occurs at 52:15. On the other
 hand, we would think it would probably be a
 good idea if he returned more to the normal sleep
 rest cycle; and if you got him up nominally to
 do the 52:15 work, then perhaps he would be ready
 to go back to sleep at about 61 hours, when he
 nominally is expected to do so.
02 03 13 55 CDR Okay. He's up now, eating. We are planning to
 go to normal procedures on the flight plan.
02 03 14 02 CC Okay. That - that's fine then. If - you know,
 there is no - it's not time critical that P23
 be done at 52:15, but if you get up to do it then,
 that's just fine.
02 03 14 16 CDR Well, we thought we might give it a try.
02 03 14 18 CC Roger.
02 03 14 23 CDR This sleep cycle here is - we're just going to
 have to real time it, I guess. I'm supposed to
 be asleep right now but, obviously - or I'm supposed
 to go to sleep here shortly, but I just got up.
 We are going to have to play this by ear.

Tape 35
Page 3
02 03 14 39 CC Roger. Understand.
02 03 17 39 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
02 03 17 41 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
02 03 17 46 CDR Are the stars in the flight plan proper for this
 next exercise of P23?
02 03 17 52 CC We would like to talk to Jim about it when he is
 ready to copy.
02 03 17 59 CDR He's ready.
02 03 18 01 CC Okay.
02 03 18 03 CMP Good morning, Mike. How are you doing?
02 03 18 05 CC Fine, fine, Jim. You are sounding good this
 morning. We would like to give you a little
 rundown on these stars. As you can see in the
 flight plan, we've got you scheduled for a number
 33, Antares, number 34, Atria, and number 40,
 old Altair. Now, the first of those, Antares,
 is in plane; the second two are out of plane. As
 you know, we would like to get a mixture of the in
 and the out of plane. Antares, number 33, is
 close to the sun, and we expect that you are going
 to have difficulty getting these measurements on
 number 33. We would like very much for you to
 try, but if you are unable to do number 33, then
 we propose that you use number 42, which is Peacock,
 to the lunar far horizon. We realize Peacock isn't
 the greatest one available - greatest star in the
 sky - but it's about the only one available. Over.

Tape 35
Page 4
02 03 19 06 CMP Roger. Understand. I'll - we will go to
 Antares first and try it. You know, we tried
 it last time, but I got one set before I lost
 the moon completely in the white haze. I'll
 give it another try, and if it doesn't work
 out, we will go to Peacock and give it -
02 03 19 26 CC That - that is affirmative, Jim, and if neither
 Antares nor Peacock work, well then, we just will
 be happy to go with Atria and with Altair. We
 would like them to increase the number of sets
 and do three on Atria, that is, number 34, and two
 on Altair, number 40; but that is only in the event
 that you can get neither Antares nor Peacock.
02 03 20 07 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Did you copy?
02 03 20 12 CMP Roger. This is 8. Copied. We'll increase the
 number 34 to three and the number set of 40 to
 two if we cannot get 33 or 42.
02 03 20 25 CC Yes, that's exactly right.
02 03 47 55 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
02 03 47 59 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
02 03 48 02 CC Roger. We're getting low bit rate from you,
 rather than high, and on this P23 work, for us
 to get our data, you're going to have to delay
 the DSKY display about 10 seconds when it comes
 up with NOUN - NOUN 87. Over.
02 03 48 18 CDR Roger.

Tape 35
Page 5
02 03 48 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We are past that 87 display
 now. Did you write down what your trunnion bias
 was?
02 03 48 57 CDR Negative.
02 03 49 00 CMP Houston, we haven't started 23 yet. Our CAL is
 zero.
02 03 49 12 CC Roger. Understand. Thank you.
02 03 49 17 CMP We are in the process now to - to go to P23
 attitude.
02 03 49 27 CC Roger. Thank you.
02 03 53 42 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 03 53 47 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
02 03 53 49 CC Roger. Downlink data shows that on star 33,
 Jim is using the lunar far horizon when he should
 be using the lunar near horizon. Over.
02 03 54 02 CDR Okay. Thank you. 220?
02 03 54 07 CC Roger. 220.
02 03 54 14 CDR Let us check it.
02 03 54 16 CC Roger.
02 03 54 58 CDR You want the far horizon now, Houston?
02 03 55 01 CC Roger. Far horizon.
02 03 55 06 CDR We have far horizon in now, Mike, on 220. I
 will check again, though.
02 03 55 12 CC Yes. That is right. We are requesting the
 lunar near horizon as per the flight plan, the
 lunar near horizon. We show that you are using
 the lunar far horizon.

Tape 35
Page 6
02 03 55 27 CMP Okay. Roger. I thought that you had copied
 up 220 to me. I will put it in the near horizon.
02 03 55 34 CC Roger.
02 03 58 50 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
02 03 58 52 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
02 03 59 03 LMP Mike, it's getting kind of damp - we're getting
 a playback, Mike. It is getting kind of damp in
 here. It might be a good idea to go back into
 AUTO on the temp in - the glycol temp in for
 awhile to try and get some of this moisture out
 of the cabin.
02 03 59 21 CC Roger. Stand by, Bill.
02 03 59 28 LMP Roger.
02 04 00 08 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 04 00 13 LMP Go ahead.
02 04 00 14 CC We concur. We would like you to go back to
 AUTO on the glycol temp inlet valve. Over.
02 04 00 22 LMP Okay. When was our lowest radiator OUT TEMP
 during the last couple of hours while we have
 been in MANUAL?
02 04 00 28 CC I will get it for you.
02 04 00 33 LMP And we are back in AUTO.
02 04 00 35 CC Roger. Back in AUTO, and 29 degrees is as low
 as we've seen.
02 04 00 43 LMP Okay. We are showing a CABIN TEMP of about 76.
 It is very comfortable, but we are getting a lot
 of condensation on the walls now.

Tape 35
Page 7
02 04 00 54 CC Roger. Understand.
02 04 05 00 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
02 04 05 04 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston.
02 04 05 08 CDR Roger, Mike. While we are waiting for the
 spacecraft to maneuver to the moon, I might
 note that as we get closer to the moon, the
 light from the sun comes right into the scanning
 telescope, and it is impossible to use. You have
 to rely on the sextant alone.
02 04 05 35 CC Roger, Jim. Understand that light from the sun
 is coming into the scanning telescope making it
 impossible to see, and you have to rely on the
 sextant alone. Can you attach any angle to that?
02 04 05 55 CDR Well, Mike, I am right now at the substellar point
 of 33. I don't know where the sun is exactly
 from there, but that is about the angle. We're -
 the optics are pointed right at the moon now.
02 04 06 10 CC Roger. Understand.
02 04 08 47 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We are going to be changing
 our antenna in a couple of minutes. You can
 expect a COMM switch-over.
02 04 08 57 CDR Thank you.
END OF TAPE

Tape 36
Page 1
02 04 19 22 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
02 04 19 26 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
02 04 19 30 LMP Roger. The LMP is going to take a little snooze
 here for a while. I am wondering, can you give me
 a quick - your view of the system status here before
 I depart, and, also, give me an idea of when
 the next cryo stir is due?
02 04 19 48 CC Roger, Bill. Will do; stand by.
02 04 20 23 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 04 20 27 LMP Go ahead.
02 04 20 29 CC Roger. Your systems remain unchanged. They are
 all looking good. You can go ahead and stir up
 the cryo starting right now.
02 04 20 38 LMP Okay. Will do.
02 04 25 19 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 04 25 23 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
02 04 25 25 CC Roger. Before Jim makes his next mark, could he
 call up VERB 1 NOUN 91? We missed the last
 trunnion. Over.
02 04 25 36 CDR Roger. The last trunnion was 10660.
02 04 25 41 CC 10660. Thank you.
02 04 26 53 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 04 26 59 CDR Go ahead.
02 04 27 00 CC Roger. Before Bill gets his snooze, we would like
 him to give us a PRD readout on all three crewmembers. Over.

Tape 36
Page 2
02 04 27 12 LMP Roger. CDR is 0.06, CMP is 0.64, and LMP is 0.64.
02 04 27 51 CC Roger. Thank you, Bill.
02 04 28 00 CDR Looks like I'm the only one that is radioactive.
02 04 28 02 CC Understand.
02 04 28 18 CMP Okay. Houston, we got three sets on 33; we are
 going now to 34 lunar far horizon for one set.
 Don't you agree?
02 04 28 26 CC We agree. Star 34 lunar far horizon for one set.
02 04 29 48 LMP Houston, the cryos have been stirred, and could
 you also give me a quick rundown on how the SPS
 line temps are doing?
02 04 29 58 CC Roger, Bill. Understand you stirred the cryos.
 Last time we checked, the SPS line temps were
 excellent; they were nice and warm. We will give
 you another number right now.
02 04 30 10 LMP And a PU valve.
02 04 31 05 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 04 31 10 LMP Go ahead.
02 04 31 12 CC Roger. On your SPS system, your oxidizer is running
 75 degrees, fuel 74 degrees, and PU valve between
 78 and 82 depending on where we measured it. Over.
02 04 31 27 LMP Real good. Everything really is working fine, isn't
 it?
02 04 31 30 CC Yes, it's really humming along, Bill.
02 04 31 37 LMP Okay. See you later.
02 04 31 39 CC Adios.

Tape 36
Page 3
02 04 37 57 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
02 04 38 01 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston.
02 04 38 05 CDR I understand you want two sets on number 40,
 lunar near horizon. Is that right?
02 04 38 08 CC That's affirmative. Two sets on number 40,
 lunar near horizon.
02 04 42 25 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 04 42 30 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
02 04 42 32 CC Roger. We missed your last trunnion angle, Frank.
02 04 42 37 CDR 21450.
02 04 42 41 CC Roger. 21450, and Paul tells me Valerie is over
 here and wishes Bill a happy nap.
02 04 42 52 CDR Okay. Thank you. Tell her that he makes us
 tired sometimes too, will you?
02 04 43 13 CC Roger. I will deliver a modified version of the
 message.
02 04 43 20 CDR Thank you.
02 04 43 58 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 04 44 04 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
02 04 44 07 CC Roger. On star number 40 that you are doing now,
 the flight plan only calls for one set of marks.
 You called down two sets, and it's really your
 choice. Only one is required. We are glad to
 have the data if you do a second set. Over.
02 04 44 24 CDR We will only do one then, if you want to. Our
 flight plan has been updated to include two sets.
 That is why I called it down.

Tape 36
02 04 44 32 CC Roger. One set is - will suffice.
02 04 47 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We missed the last trunnion.
02 04 47 34 CDR Very well, I will read it to you; 21455.
02 04 47 39 CC 21455. Thank you. Just a matter of interest:
 it is taking your voice about 1.6 seconds to
 get down to us.
02 04 47 51 CDR I'm a little hoarse, that's why.
02 04 48 19 CDR Okay. Houston, do you want us to go back to the
 PTC attitude now and start the rotisserie again?
02 04 48 25 CC That is affirmative, Frank. We will have the PTC
 attitude for you in just a second here.
02 04 48 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 04 48 53 CDR Go ahead.
02 04 48 55 CC Roger. Those PTC attitudes remain pitch 224 degrees,
 yaw 020 degrees. On the next page, page 239 of
 your flight plan, those PTC numbers should be changed
 to reflect that.
02 04 49 12 CDR Pitch 224 and yaw 20.
02 04 49 15 CC That's affirmative.
02 04 52 23 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
02 04 52 25 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
02 04 52 31 CC When you have a few minutes, we would like to
 hear the detailed crew status report from you.
02 04 52 40 CDR Like what?
02 04 52 42 CC Well, like we would like to know, in the last
 24 hours, has anybody had any symptoms similar

Tape 36
Page 5
 to Frank's. We would also like to know - You know,
 we told you the other day to take Marezine as you
 like - we would like to know if anybody had taken
 any drugs, and then we would like to talk over there
 about sweet breads and water and such.
02 04 53 01 CDR Okay. Nobody has taken any other drugs; nobody
 took any Marezine; nobody is sick. Bill took one
 of those pills, a sleep Seconal pill, last night.
 Everybody had breakfast this morning and ate most
 of a meal - 1 day 3 - meal A day 3. What else
 do you want?
02 04 53 31 CC We would like to tell you to drink plenty of water.
 We think that your water intake may be down. We
 copied your dosimeter readings. The only other
 thing is we just were wondering how in general you
 feel. We show you to have about 15 hours sleep
 total - Frank or Bill about 10, and Jim about
 the same, and we were wondering just how you
 are feeling in general.
02 04 53 58 CDR We all feel fine; we are going to fix it now so
 that we all have one more rest period before the
 LOI.
02 04 54 04 CC Roger. Thank you.
02 04 54 11 CMP Happiness is bacon squares for breakfast.
02 04 54 18 CC If you don't eat them all, bring them back,
 and we'll polish them off here.

Tape 36
Page 6
02 04 54 34 CDR Okay, Houston. Apollo 8 here. I stand corrected,
 William had one Marezine. He didn't tell me
 about it; he snuck it.
02 04 54 40 CC Roger. Understand Lovell took the Marezine.
 Understand.
02 04 54 43 CDR That's Bill Anders, and he took one when he took
 the - with the Lomotil, when the doctors told him
 to.
02 04 54 54 CC Roger. We copy that. Thank you.
02 04 56 06 CDR Okay. We are back on the bar-b-que attitude,
 starting PTC.
02 04 56 10 CC Roger, Apollo 8. Thank you.
02 04 56 21 CDR Mike, we ran the latest state vector we have through
 the P21, and it showed the pericynthian at 69.7 miles.
02 04 56 30 CC Yes, we were all having big talks about that down
 here. It looks like you are giving us a real good
 comparison on our system. Looking - looking extremely good.
02 04 56 45 CDR We've got the navigator par excellence.
02 04 56 50 CC I believe.
02 04 57 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 04 57 33 CDR Go ahead.
02 04 57 36 CC Roger. What was the time you used on that P21?
02 04 57 42 CDR 6910 there, Mr. Slide Rule.
02 04 57 46 CC Thank you.
02 04 58 01 CC Mike, I wonder if Buzz wants us to change the time?

Tape 36
Page 7
02 04 58 04 CC No, that is fine.
02 04 58 07 CDR Oh, okay. Thank you.
02 05 03 07 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
02 05 03 11 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 05 03 15 CDR Roger. Are you going to give us an update for
 a maneuver PC plus 2 that does not assume a flyby
 maneuver?
02 05 03 26 CC Roger. Stand by.
02 05 08 03 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 05 08 12 CMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
02 05 08 14 CC Roger. Here is a rather brief summary of the
 updates that you will be getting. The one that you
 have now for PC plus 2 following an LOI minus 8
 flyby maneuver is still good. That will not be
 updated. The next update you will get will be
 MCC 4. After that, you will get two PC plus 2
 maneuvers, that assume MCC 4 completed. One will
 be a minimum DELTA-V, and the other will be a
 fast return. Do you copy?
02 05 08 50 CMP Roger. Understand, and also I take it for MCC 4
 you are going to give us a new alignment. Is
 that correct?
02 05 08 57 CC That is affirmative.
02 05 26 31 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 05 26 36 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

Tape 36
Page 8
02 05 26 38 CC Roger, Frank. I've got a lot of talking to do
 regarding TV cameras and brackets and whatnot. I
 would like to start in on it whenever you are
 ready to talk about it.
02 05 26 52 CDR Let me get a piece of paper out.
02 05 26 54 CC Okay.
02 05 27 06 CDR Go ahead.
02 05 27 08 CC Okay. First a question. Are you planning to
 show us TV pictures of the earth today?
02 05 27 18 CDR Well, that is what we wanted to do. It seems
 that would be the most interesting thing we can
 show you, but we - you know, we had trouble with
 the lens.
02 05 27 25 CC Well, okay, that's good. All this procedure
 that I am going to give to you here is relative
 to what we hope are fixes to the lens and for
 looking out your rendezvous window at the earth,
 and all the gimbal angles and all that good
 stuff is based toward looking out the window at
 the earth rather than at the moon. Over.
02 05 27 49 CDR Roger.
02 05 27 50 CC Okay. First, unstow the red filter, the polarizing
 filter, the red and blue filter holder, and some
 tape. Over.
02 05 28 07 CDR Okay. Let me write this down.
02 05 28 09 CC Roger. I'd suggest that. I've got a whole page
 full.

Tape 36
Page 9

02 05 28 33 CDR Okay.
02 05 28 35 CC Alright. Tape the red filter to the telephoto
 lens. That red filter is the 25A red filter,
 not the one that is in the red and blue filter
 holder.
02 05 28 48 CDR Roger.
02 05 28 49 CC Attach telephoto lens to the camera.
02 05 28 56 CDR Okay. We can figure out how to do that. Roger.
02 05 29 00 CC Insure that the automatic light control, the ALC
 switch on the camera, is in the IN position.
 Over.
02 05 29 11 CDR ALC IN. Roger.
02 05 29 14 CC Roger. Attach camera to the adjustable TV bracket
 and attach the bracket to the TV mounting point
 on the commander's side of the hatch to point out
 rendezvous window number 2.
02 05 29 41 CDR Roger.
02 05 29 43 CC Okay. There is a note here that says use dovetail
 on top of camera, rather than the side dovetail.
 Use the dovetail on the top of the camera for mounting
 to bracket and place the rocking nut on the
 bracket down, and down means toward your minus X
 direction.
02 05 30 16 CDR Roger.
02 05 30 18 CC Okay. They say this step I just got through giving
 you is somewhat complicated. You might want to get

Tape 36
Page 10
 the cameras set up early using the instructions I
 just gave you. When it's properly - -
02 05 30 31 CDR We are not reading you.
02 05 30 34 CC Roger. I say again, the instructions that I
 just gave you should end up having the camera
 looking out the window and about 30 degrees
 yawed left from your plus X-axis, so I suggest you
 get the camera set up that way early; and if
 there are any problems, come back to us; we will
 talk them over. These mounting instructions are
 sort of complicated.
02 05 31 00 CDR Roger.
02 05 31 03 CC Okay. The next step: dim the interior lights.
 Over.
02 05 31 12 CDR Dim interior lights.
02 05 31 14 CC Roger. Next, stop passive thermal control at
 gimbal angles pitch 224, yaw 020, roll 270. Over.
02 05 31 36 CDR Pitch 224, yaw 020, roll 270.
02 05 31 41 CC Roger. Next, acquire on high-gain antenna, switch
 to AUTO tracks, narrow beam upon acquisition. Over.
02 05 32 02 CDR Got it.
02 05 32 04 CC Okay. Yaw spacecraft left to get good view of
 earth and your rendezvous window number 2. You
 may have to pitch slightly as well, but primarily
 a left yawing maneuver to get a good view of the
 earth.

Tape 36
Page 11
02 05 32 20 CDR Got it.
02 05 32 22 CC Okay. This maneuver is going to put you very
 close to your scan limits for the high-gain
 antenna, so while you are making the maneuver,
 check your lights. If your scan limit light comes
 on, you still have got 15 degrees to play with.
 But the only message is, should you break lock,
 then you are going to have to go back and reacquire
 and do that maneuver over again, because you are
 going to be very close to the edge of your high-gain
 antenna capability.
02 05 32 52 CDR Thank you.
02 05 32 54 CC Okay. And then finally, now that you have got the
 spacecraft over there, aim the camera as required
 to include the earth in the field of view, and
 do not touch the body of the lens while televising.
 Apparently, if you put your hands on the lens
 itself, it causes electrical interference. Over.
02 05 33 26 CDR Okay. Aim camera and do not touch lens while
 televising.
02 05 33 30 CC Right. And in all this stuff in all these pictures
 using the ALC, it is important that you let
 the camera stabilize for at least 10 or 20 seconds,
 to let the ALC do its thing.
02 05 33 58 CDR Stabilize for 10 to 20 seconds. Thank you.
02 05 34 01 CC Right. Now we have some additional instructions in
 case this does not work. They say a full 20, Frank,

Tape 36
Page 12
 on that ALC. It requires a full 20 seconds undisturbed
 for the ALC to properly do its thing. Now
 if these procedures that I've given you do not
 work, then we will be giving you some more, and
 they have to do with other filters and various
 combinations thereof. So I'd have the polarizing
 filter and the red and blue filter holder at hand
 because we will be attempting to use those in
 addition to the red filters if this procedure
 doesn't work.
02 05 34 43 CDR All very well, Mike.
02 05 34 46 CC That's all we have right now. We will have a few
 more remarks on the TV coming up to you later.
 I would suggest that you get set up for this early,
 and if you have any questions on it, shoot them
 down to us. We have a bunch of experts down here
 to help out.
02 05 35 03 CDR Thank you; will do.
END OF TAPE

02 06 06 18 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
02 06 06 23 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
02 06 06 25 CC Roger. Just a voice check, Frank.
02 06 06 30 CDR Roger. You're loud and clear.
02 06 06 32 CC Thank you.
02 06 18 50 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 06 18 55 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
02 06 18 57 CC Roger. We would like some high bit rate data
 when you can get it locked up on the high gain.
 We haven't had any of that for a while.
02 06 19 06 CDR Roger. We will do that.
02 06 19 09 CC Thank you. How is that camera bracket thing
 working out?
02 06 19 13 CDR We are doing it right now.
02 06 19 53 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8 transmitting to you
 on the high gain. How do you read?
02 06 19 57 CC Read you loud and clear, Frank. Thank you.
02 06 20 08 CDR Apollo 8 transmitting on the high-gain antenna.
02 06 20 11 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You are loud and clear. Thank
 you for the high gain.
02 06 20 18 CDR Roger.
02 06 32 59 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8. Are you getting high
 bit rate all right?
02 06 33 08 CC That is affirmative, Apollo 8. We are getting
 a good high bit rate.
02 06 33 14 CDR Thank you.

Tape 37
Page 2
02 06 33 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 06 33 40 CDR Go ahead.
02 06 33 42 CC Roger. I've got some more talking to do about
 the TV any time it's convenient for you.
02 06 33 48 CDR Go ahead.
02 06 33 50 CC Okay. First thing, we've made no provisions
 in these instructions for taking pictures of the
 moon. If you get some moon shots after it's all
 over by looking out a different window or by
 making some small maneuver, of course, we would
 be happy to have them, but the show as scheduled
 is just out the window at the earth only. Over.
02 06 34 15 CDR Roger.
02 06 34 17 CC The second point is, of course, when you stop
 your passive thermal control, you are about 90 degrees
 to the earth line, so when you make that
 yaw left, you are going to have to yaw left until
 your middle gimbal angle is in the vicinity of
 60 degrees. You will get the additional 30 degrees
 by offset between where the camera is pointed and
 your plus X axis. But the two together are going
 to total up around 90. We just wanted to make sure
 that you understood you were going to be working
 with a large middle gimbal angle. Over.
02 06 34 52 CDR Roger. We understand that. We also are looking
 at the earth right now, and there is a spectacular

Tape 37
Page 3
 long thin band of clouds. Looks like it may be
 a jet stream. It's absolutely spectacular -
 going almost all the way - or half way around the
 earth.
02 06 35 12 CC Roger. Well, you might want to repeat that during
 the TV narrative, and we would like you, if possible,
 to go into as much of a detailed description as you
 poets can on the various colors and sizes of those
 things and how the earth appears to you, in as much
 detail as you can possibly muster. Over.
02 06 35 36 CDR Roger. I figure we will have to do that because
 I bet you - I won't bet - but I bet the TV doesn't
 work.
02 06 35 44 CC Well, we won't take that bet, but anyway, we are
 standing by for a nice lurid description, and
 we would suggest that you talk a little bit slower
 than you did yesterday. Over.
02 06 35 56 CDR Okay.
02 06 35 58 CC And the only other thing on this TV is that the
 experts tell us that - do not point - with the
 wide angle lens on the camera, do not point at
 either the earth or the moon. It comes close to
 damaging interior of the instrument due to the
 fact that it's too bright. Over.
02 06 36 18 CDR Understand.
02 06 36 20 CC Thank you.

Tape 37
Page 4
02 06 41 23 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. We're going to have to
 switch to an OMNI.
02 06 41 28 CC Roger, Apollo 8.
02 06 52 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
02 06 53 03 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
02 06 53 05 CC Roger. Just checking the voice COMM, Frank.
02 06 53 09 CDR Thank you.
02 06 57 39 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 06 57 44 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
02 06 57 46 CC Roger. We'll be switching antennas from Madrid
 to Goldstone in another 3 minutes. You can
 expect a glitch on your COMM.
02 06 57 56 CDR Thank you.
02 07 02 38 CDR Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
02 07 02 41 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're reading you loud
 and clear through Goldstone. Over.
02 07 02 46 CDR Okay. We have the television ON now, and we're
 trying to maneuver to the - to the earth.
02 07 02 55 CC Roger. Understand.
02 07 04 11 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
02 07 04 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
02 07 04 20 CMP Roger. We're maneuvering to position now for
 the TV. Bill's got it set up in Frank's left
 rendezvous window, and I'm over in Bill's spot
 looking out the right rendezvous window, and the
 earth is now passing through my window. It's
 about as big as the end of my thumb.

Tape 37
Page 5
02 07 04 45 CC About as big as the end of your thumb at arm's
 length, huh?
02 07 04 51 CMP That's right. I think what we see now is South
 America down below us.
02 07 04 55 CC Roger. Is the TV camera pointed about 30 degrees
 yaw left from the plus X axis?
02 07 05 05 CMP Stand by a moment. We're checking it. We think
 we've got it in the right position. We're going
 into position now.
02 07 05 13 CC Okay.
02 07 05 33 LMP Houston, are you getting any sort of a picture?
02 07 05 52 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Negative; not yet.
02 07 06 32 LMP Okay. Houston, Apollo 8. We should have - -
02 07 07 36 CDR Hello, Houston; this is Apollo 8. We have the
 television camera pointed directly at the earth
 now and have followed the instructions you gave
 us.
02 07 07 45 CC Roger, Frank. We're picking something up on our
 TV. It's not very good so far, but let it sit
 for a second, and we'll have more instructions
 for you.
02 07 08 00 CC Okay. It's coming into view now, Frank.
02 07 08 07 CDR It is?
02 07 08 08 CC Yes. We have it in the corner of our screen.
 You're slightly off on your pointing, but we're
 getting a darn good look at the corner of it.

Tape 37
Page 6
02 07 08 21 CC It's moving off, Frank. It's moving off our -
 3 o'clock on our TV screen. I have no idea
 what to tell you about which way to point.
02 07 08 32 CC It's moving further away. We've lost it now.
02 07 08 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Receiving nothing now. Over.
02 07 09 03 CDR Okay.
02 07 09 05 CC We're receiving the picture; we're just not
 seeing the view of the earth.
02 07 09 11 CDR Roger. I got you.
02 07 09 16 CC Okay. We are just picking it up at 3 o'clock
 on our screen.
02 07 09 21 CDR Okay.
02 07 09 23 CC It is moving up toward 1 o'clock and in toward
 the center; keep it going in that direction.
02 07 09 29 CDR Okay.
02 07 09 31 CC It's looking better. You're holding it about
 1 or 2 o'clock. Looking better. Give us a
 little more in that same direction. You're down
 at 3 o'clock now. We see about half of what you
 see. Too much. It is disappearing at our
 5 o'clock. Now it is coming back. It is half
 off - screen at our 2 o'clock.
02 07 10 05 CC And it's disappeared off at our 3 o'clock. There,
 It is coming back in now. It is headed toward the
 center of our screen.
02 07 10 14 CC MARK.

Tape 37
Page 7
02 07 10 15 CC It is right in the center of our screen. Just
 hold her - hold her steady. It is really looking
 good. Okay. We have - -
02 07 10 28 CMP What you're seeing, Mike, is a - Houston, what
 you are seeing is the Western Hemisphere.
 Looking - at the top is the North Pole; in the
 center - just lower to the center is South America -
 all the way down to Cape Horn. I can see Baja
 California and the southwestern part of the United
 States. There is a big long cloud bank going
 northeast, covers a lot of the Gulf of Mexico,
 going up to the eastern part of the United States,
 and it appears now that the east coast is cloudy,
 I can see clouds over parts of Mexico; the parts
 of Central America are clear. And we can also see
 the white, bright spots of the subsolar point on
 the light side of the earth.
02 07 11 28 CC Roger. Could you give me some ideas about the
 colors, and also, could you try a slight maneuver?
 It is disappearing. We're seeing about half of it.
 It is going off to our 12 o'clock. Now it is
 going off to our 3 o'clock. That is the wrong
 direction. Yes, that is a good direction.
02 07 11 50 CC We need another small correction to bring it to our
 center screen. If you could maneuver toward the
 terminator, that is the part of it we are missing.

Tape 37
Page 8
 We are getting the lighted portion. There you
 go; that's fine. Stop it right there.
02 07 12 17 CMP Okay. For colors, waters are all sort of a royal
 blue; clouds, of course, are bright white; the
 reflection off the earth is - appears much
 greater than the moon. The land areas are generally
 a brownish - sort of dark brownish to light brown
 in texture. Many of the vortices of clouds can
 be seen of the various weather cells. A long
 band of - it appears cirrus clouds that extend
 from the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico going
 straight out across the Atlantic. The terminator,
 of course, cuts through the Atlantic Ocean right
 now, going from north to south. Southern Hemisphere
 is almost completely clouded over, and up near
 the North Pole there is quite a few clouds.
 Southwestern Texas and southwestern United States
 is clear. I'd say there are some clouds up in
 the northwest and over in the northeast portion.
02 07 13 25 CC Roger. Could you maneuver toward the terminator
 again, please?
02 07 13 34 CC A little bit more. Stop her right there and hold
 it. It keeps slipping up a little bit; could
 you maneuver slightly more toward the terminator?
02 07 14 02 CDR How is that, Houston?

Tape 37
Page 9
02 07 14 05 CC We are getting about half of the earth, Frank.
 The top half - our top half which includes the
 dark portion it - is obscured.
02 07 14 19 CDR How is the definition on the picture?
02 07 14 23 CC Looks pretty good.
02 07 14 28 CMP Can you see cloud patterns at all?
02 07 14 31 CC That's affirmative.
02 07 14 36 CMP Good.
02 07 14 39 LMP Are you still seeing it, Houston?
02 07 14 42 CC Yes, we are seeing it. We are missing the
 portion of the earth that is over toward the
 terminator. The dark portion of the earth is
 what we are not picking up. We are getting
 about three-quarters or four-fifths of the
 rest of it.
02 07 14 56 LMP Roger. I will move it, and tell me when I am
 getting better or worse please.
02 07 15 01 CC Good.
02 07 15 08 CC Stop right there. That is worse, Bill. Go
 back where you were. You make it disappear to
 our 3 o'clock. Now it's coming back. Okay.
 Stop right there. Now you are back where you were,
 and we need a motion that is about 90 degrees to
 that last one you gave us.
02 07 15 38 CC That is the wrong 90 degrees. 180 degrees away
 from that one.

02 07 15 47 CC Stop right there. Okay. Now we have lost a
 different half of it. I need a motion 90 degrees
 to that last one.
02 07 16 24 CC That is good right there, Bill. That is good
 right there.
02 07 16 42 CC Apollo 8, Houston. If you can stick your polarizing
 filter in front of the camera without
 disturbing anything else, it might improve the
 quality slightly.
02 07 17 02 LMP Standby.
02 07 17 04 CC Roger, Bill.
02 07 17 12 LMP Okay. The polarising filter is in front.
02 07 17 24 LMP How is it now, Mike?
02 07 17 28 CC Still looking good. That didn't make much of
 a change one way or another, but in general, considering
 how far away, it's looking excellent.
02 07 17 51 LMP Well, I hope that everyone enjoys the picture
 that we are taking of themselves. How far away
 from earth now, Jim, about?
02 07 18 03 CC We have you about 180 000.
02 07 18 11 LMP You are looking at yourselves at 180 000 miles
 out in space.
02 07 18 22 CMP Frank, what I keep imagining is if I am some
 lonely traveler from another planet what I
 would think about the earth at this altitude,
 whether I think it would be inhabited or not.

02 07 18 31 CC Don't see anybody waving; is that what you are
 saying?
02 07 18 36 CMP I was just kind of curious if I would land on
 the blue or the brown part of the earth.
02 07 18 44 LMP You better hope that we land on the blue part.
02 07 18 46 CC So do we, babe.
02 07 18 49 LMP Jim is always for land landings.
02 07 18 55 CC Roger. This picture is drifting off center
 again. If you could make another correction
 to bring it back. I couldn't tell you which
 direction, but you're going the right way, you're
 going the right way. A little bit more; a little
 bit more. Whoa, stop right there. That's the
 best centering we have had, Apollo 8. If you
 could just hold that, that's perfect,
02 07 19 25 LMP To give you some idea, Mike, of what we can
 see: I can pick out the southwest coastline of
 the Gulf and where Houston should be, and also
 the mouth of the Mississippi; I can see Baja
 California and that particular area. I am using
 a monocular that we have aboard.
02 07 19 50 CC Roger. Understand.
02 07 19 55 CMP This is an 8-power instrument I have.
02 07 19 58 CC Right. Well, we are seeing the entire earth
 now including the terminator. Course we can't
 see anything past the terminator at all. Are

Tape 37
Page 12
 you able with your binoculars to see the dark
 horizon? Anything past the terminator?
02 07 20 13 CMP Negative, Mike. We can't see anything past the
 terminator with the binoculars or without them.
 This earth is just too bright, and it cuts down
 the night adaptation to see anything on the
 dark side.
02 07 20 31 CC Roger. Understand.
02 07 20 33 LMP Since this is winter - since this is winter time
 in the northern hemisphere, we can see all of
 the South Pole and the southern ice cap, and
 not too much of the North Pole.
02 07 20 48 CDR Hey, you and Jim better get together. Jim just
 said he saw the North Pole.
02 07 20 54 CC He is looking out a different window.
02 07 20 57 LMP That is what makes it different.
02 07 20 59 CC Do you still have the - -
02 07 21 01 LMP He has the monocular upside down.
02 07 21 03 CC Do you still have the polarizing filter in front
 of the camera?
END OF TAPE

---- LMP Negative?
---- CC Okay.
---- CC Try putting it back in front of the camera one
 more time.
---- LMP ... Okay?
---- CC And once again, we need a small attitude correction.
 Our earth is disappearing up and to the right.
 Our earth and your earth. The wrong way, wrong
 way. A little bit more. Okay. That is fine
 if you can hold it right there. Oops! Now it's
 slipping back off again. Okay. Keep coming a
 little bit more, a little bit more. Okay. Ninety
 degrees to that direction; that is the wrong 90,
 the other way. There we go. A little bit more.
 Nope, wrong way, wrong way; I am sorry. Keep
 coming in that direction. No, it is gone up at
 our 12 o'clock. There we go, it is coming back
 down. There we go, it's coming back down, it's
 coming back down. Bring it down a little bit
 more. Okay. Stop. Now we need 90 degrees to
 that direction again.
02 07 22 54 LMP I hope that the next camera has a sight on it.
02 07 22 58 CC Roger.
02 07 23 11 LMP How is that?
02 07 23 13 CC Well, that has disappeared, just practically.
 We were wondering if there was any chance of your

Tape 38
Page 2
 looking out one of the other windows
 and seeing the moon? Hey, it is coming back in, Bill. Okay.
 Hold it right there. That is just fine for the
 earth right where you are. That is extremely good
 on the earth if you can just hold that.
02 07 23 35 CDR I don't think we have - It has the polarizing filter
 in front of it now, Mike.
02 07 23 53 CC Roger. Thank you, and it is centered very well.
 We get a very slight improvement with this, but
 in general, it is very good considering the distance.
 How about the moon, Frank? Is it visible
 through one of your other windows? Could you get
 it visible with a small maneuver?
02 07 24 05 CDR Negative. I think we will have to save the moon
 for another time.
02 07 24 08 CC Roger. I understand. You are still very well
 centered with your picture. We noticed a couple
 of jumps in the apparent intensity. Did you make
 some filter changes?
02 07 24 37 CDR Roger. We tried to put that other red filter in
 front of it, but it didn't seem to fit.
02 07 24 43 CC Roger.
02 07 24 49 CC We would - On a final test when you get down to
 the end of your allotted time here, we would like
 you to remove all filters and let us see how it
 looks with all filters removed, and then we would

Tape 38
Page 4
 like to get several spotmeter readings at the
 very end after the test.
02 07 25 13 CDR Okay. We will be removing the red filter now.
02 07 25 15 CC Roger.
02 07 25 50 CDR Do you still have us, Mike? The lens is off now.
02 07 25 53 CC Roger. We have it, and if you could maneuver it
 toward the terminator slightly, you would again
 center our picture.
02 07 26 11 CDR Okay. Stand by. How's that? Is that the right
 direction?
02 07 26 21 CC That is the right direction. Keep coming. Now
 that is the wrong direction, Frank. Did you - -
02 07 26 44 CDR How is it now, Houston?
02 07 26 46 CC Well, negative. I need another maneuver toward
 the terminator. It is drifting off the screen
 to our 11 o'clock. We appear to need a maneuver
 toward the terminator, Frank.
02 07 27 08 CDR Thank you.
02 07 27 17 CC No, that is apparently the wrong way, Frank. We
 are starting to lose the picture. There you go.
 That is the correct way.
02 07 27 35 CDR Okay, Houston. How's that for today?
02 07 27 39 CC That is just fine, Frank. That's great. We
 would like to, at the conclusion here, take
 three spotmeter readings. You can do that
 at any time at your convenience. We would just

Tape 38
Page 5
 like to get some after-the-fact readings on the
 earth intensity.
02 07 27 55 CDR Roger. Jim has got the spotmeter on now.
02 07 27 57 CC Thank you.
02 07 27 58 CDR Is it centered now, Houston?
02 07 28 00 CC Not quite, Frank.
02 07 28 08 CC That's good right there. Hold that right there.
 That's perfect.
02 07 28 24 CDR Okay, earth. This is Apollo 8 signing off for
 today.
02 07 28 29 CC Good show, Apollo 8. We appreciate it. See
 you manana.
02 07 28 34 CDR Roger.
02 07 28 55 CC We have Haney down here following your trajectory,
 so all is well. He says you're 10 minutes from
 the moon's sphere of influence.
02 07 29 04 CDR Okay. Good.
02 07 33 28 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. Returning to the PTC mode.
02 07 33 34 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Understand; returning to PTC.
 Thank you.
02 07 33 41 CDR Roger.
02 07 33 54 CC You can tell Jim he is getting pretty ham-handed
 with that P21; he got a perilune altitude three-tenths
 of a mile off what we are predicting down
 here.
02 07 34 08 CDR Is that right?

Tape 38
Page 6
02 07 34 09 CC Roger. Apparently, he got 69.7 and the RTC says
 70.
02 07 34 18 CDR Are we going to leave it at that, or are we going
 to correct it to make it lower?
02 07 34 24 CC We are talking about it, Frank.
02 07 34 50 CDR We have got a lumen reading of about between
 1 and 1.25 thousand - 1.25 K.
02 07 35 01 CC Roger. Understand; between 1 and 1.25 K. Thank
 you.
02 07 35 31 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
02 07 35 35 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 07 35 40 CMP Roger. If you put your CM TLM to ACCEPT, we will
 send you our state vector.
02 07 35 47 CC Touche.
02 07 45 03 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
02 07 45 06 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 07 45 10 CDR How does everything look, Mike, all our systems
 and everything? See any switches out of place?
02 07 45 16 CC Negative. I'll take a check around here, but it
 is looking good. Just a second.
02 07 45 23 CDR We are over in the cabin, Mike, like monkeys, and
 I wanted to make sure we didn't hit anything.
02 07 45 51 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Everything is looking good
 down here. All switches and systems are GO.
02 07 46 00 CDR Thank you.
02 07 50 25 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. How are you reading on OMNI D?
