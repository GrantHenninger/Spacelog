                              really is asking that we do this with the Hasselblad,
                              and again we won't be using the red and blue filters
                              so we have our baseline.
04 22 39 08    LMP            Taking a picture of the earth with the Hasselblad
                              is no big deal because it does swing by the earth
                              now and then. But trying to get the TV and the
                              Jiasselblad            411 pointed           to the       earth      at the        same
                              time would really be tough.
04 22 39 21    CC             Roger. I don't think that it's that time-critical,
                              but I'll ask.

04 22 59 29    LMP            We're going to hold up on the LiOH change for
                              about a half an hour. .The PC02 reading is low,
                              and we don't want to wake up the CDR. It's right
                              by his feet.

04 23 02 53    CC             Okay, Biil. We are coming up on-the P52 and then
                              the P23 sightings, and there is some concern that
                              if we just go directly to P23 attitude that we are
                              liable to overheat quad Charlie. So we would like
                              to have you maneuver to place the minus X-axis
                              towards the sun n&i. Pnd I have some gimbal angles

                              here for you. And if we take it over there and
                              point the minus X at the sun between now and the
                              time we have to start into the alignment, then
                              the P23 business - we will tend to coldsoak
                              Charlie,         and then we will              be able         to go through
                              the P23 operations without worrying about the
                              temperatures.
04 23 03 45    LMP            Okay. Give me them.
04 23 03 47    CC             Okay. Roll 183.3, pitch 136.7; yaw 13.5.
04 23 04 27    LMP            Right. 183 roll, 137 pitch, and 14 yaw.
04 23 04 31    CC             Okay.
04 23 04 36    LMP            Actually, we worked out up here on Lovell's slide
                              rule and got 183.25 roll.
04 23 06 15    LMP            Houston, you wanted to go to this coldsoak
                              attitude prior to the P52, did you not?
04 23 06 21    CC             We would like to go to the coldsoak attitude now.
04 23 06 27    LMP            And that was to keep from heating up quad D, was it?
04 23 06 30    CC             Negative. That's quad Charlie.

We're more like                   150 degrees               roll     right       now.

                              you get a chance, would you take a look at it
                              and see if you're in the same position. Over.

05 00 22 25    LMP            Okay. I'm on malfunction 23, step 2. It looks
                              to me like there is a small possibility we
                              might be boiling, but I doubt it. So you just

                              better than we expected. We're still monitor-

                              news this morning. Things are kind of quiet.
                              I guess the biggest                news is tne aCCident                      rate     -
                              the holiday deaths - which is certainly not very
                              pleasant news, but we had 233 people killed
                              nationally, and 9 of them were in Houston on
                              Christmas Eve, ma Christmas. In the world news, the
                              families made the news again. This is

05 00 56 01    CC             Here is an interesting little feature item that
                              is kind of good to hear. It seems that up in
                              Ann Arbor,           Michigan,              they       have a new youth                 gang.

                              It's     called       the Gilnet              Gang.       It     roams the streets
                              of Ann Arbor, acting in secret, and sometimes by-
                              passing the law. They call themselves the Guerillas
                              for Good. Some of the things they have done is,
                              painted a bridge that was covered with obsceni-
                              ties. They painted it one night. A condemned

                              planters unfilled because of a debate over which
                              group was responsible, business'or government,
                              were filled with flowers. A hedge, thought to
                              be hampering vision, at busy intersrztion was
                              trimmed, and the owner was angered. Trash along

                              bers of the gang are anonymous teenagers who ask
                              for no individual recognition. Their aim is to
                              slice red tape, to get things - good things in
                              their opinion - done. The organization has a
                              faint religious overtone. 1:'s sort of an ecu-

                              sounding board for the gang's ideas. The name
                              is from St. Peter, the Fisherman's Net. And it
                              is remote enough not to be identified with any

                              A lot          of their           activities           are extra-legal.                    When                               the system             bogs down, they                  directly       administer

                              nels. The gang is made up of about 55 high-
                              school kids, boys and girls, and there's another

                              graduated. The idea for the gang evolved from
                              a trip to Detroit slum area, where a church
                              group - youth group noted the way that street
                              gangs operate. They were impressed with the
                              methods of operation and decided to org.&se for
                              somewhat different reasons. "It was the chance
                              to do things for the pure sake of giving," said
                              the gang's advisor.

05 01 07 21    LMP            You can give him a weather report from Apollo 6.
                              The South Pole was really clobbered or at least

05 01 09 08    iX?R   Yes.        The answer is don't                        turn     it     into        AUTO fast.
                              It     seems to be very                  sensitive             to jerks,             or         sep-

                              the numbers and then slow and deliberate you will
                              be okay?

05 01 09 33    CC	(Laughter)               We thought           of that,               too,        down here.

                              next P23 exercise. We'd like you this time to
                              try the nose north attitude, that's pitch of 180,
                              and a yaw of 315, and also we'd like to give
                              another look at this mode free type of PTC and
                              we think maybe we'll get a little bit of spin
                              stabilization if we try it at 0.3 degrees per
                              second on the roll rate rather than 0.1. So
                              if you figure on doing that at 124:30 we'll see
                              what kind of information we can get out of it.
05 03 23 14    CDR            Okay. You know what I think of that, don't you?
                              I'll be happy to do it, but I think it's 
                              playing games.
05 03 23 22    CC             Roger, Frank, you're burning right now 1.4 pounds
                              per hour with attitude hold in pitch and yaw.
                              We're kind of interested to see if 0.3 degrees
                              per second will reduce your RCS usage due to
                              spin stabilization.
05 03 23 40    CDR            Yes, I know. I predict that it will not.

05 03 23 48    CDR            Jerry, I'm a little concerned about the 
                              temperature. We're getting kind of warm in here, and
                              also the evaporator outlet temperature is up
                              around 45 degrees. Do you have any trend that

05 03 24 15    CC             Frank, RECCM says everything looks nominal down

                              seems to help it. We've been getting a lot
                              more sun in the cabin this way.

                              on that one. I think this is more of a curiosity
                              thing than anything at all.
05 03 26 18    CMP            I think it's fine. No sweat. We don't have

05 03 26 27    CMP            Jerry, what I'm kind of curious about is the
                              fuel usage. Now with P23 and what we were
                              doing, we have a lot more fuel. 5
05 03 26 57    CC             Jim, we'll take a look at that fuel usage bit.
                              Right now, the trend looks like it is getting
                              better as we would expect with a lighter weight.
05 03 27 10    CC             We'll try to get a little more definitive for
                              you here.
05 03 27 14    Okay.

                              fuel usage on that SPS engine though, because
                              we're sure getting a lotof miles per gallon
                              out of it.
05 03 27 27    CC             Roger, Frank. Frank, we'll enter you in the
                              Shell      road test               on that.
05 03 27 29    CDR            Yes, we don't
                              that, TCP? Yes.
                              have any TCP in it,
                              That's          the problem.
                              or what is
                              If    we'd
                              had that, we would have probably used only
                              half the fuel.

                              to the right. Good. You have it centered

                              today, not much, but it's somewhat bigger. I'm
                              sitting over in the right hand seat now; Bill

                              we have a good picture. Can you see the clouds?
05 08 02 28    CC             Affirmative. We sure can. Move it up toward
                              the terminator - correction, away from the termi-

05 08 02 38    CMP            At the tip of South America, there is a great
                              swirl of clouds down there. It looks like a
                              great storm. I wonder if you can see it.
05 08 02 45    CC             Roger. We see a large swirl just south of the
                              terminator.

                              around the West Indies, and we can actually see
Florida.                 I'm           looking       thrcugh                    Bill's             monocular,

05 08 03 30    CC             Okay. You're moving it toward the center of the
                              screen now, and the earth is off on the left side
                              of our screen.
05 08 03 40    CC             Real fine. That's good. Hold it right there.
05 08 03 56    CMEJ           What we're thinking about right now, Jerry, is
                              hitting that wedge angle, about 2 degrees their
                              limit. When we come back, the earth looks pretty
                              small right from here.
