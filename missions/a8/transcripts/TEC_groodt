04 16 12 07 CC Okay.
04 16 12 12 CDR Do you want me to take the pitch yaw out of RATE COMMAND, right?
04 16 12 20 CC That's affirmative. You just put it MINIMUM IMPULSE, and then we'll watch it.
04 16 12 34 CDR There you are.
04 16 12 36 CC Okay. Thank you.
04 16 12 38 CDR Have fun.
04 16 12 41 CC Roger. And on that quad temperature - the upper limit of that thing is 105 degrees on the bottle. You are well below that. We have been watching it, and it is tracking, although it is tracking very slowly. As you roll the spacecraft, the temperature excursion seem to be a little sluggish, but it isn't a frozen sensor. And talking a little bit more about that one right now, you might tell Jim the next time he goes to work with the optics, when he works with the trunnion, if he'll go ahead and recycle the ZERO OPTICS switch, he can avoid the problem we had prior to midcourse correction 4.
04 16 13 24 CDR We've done that. And the midcourse correction 4.
04 16 13 25 CC Roger.
04 16 13 26 CDR The midcourse correction number 6 right now looks like zero, and midcourse correction number 7 is approximately 2 feet per second.

04 16 13 38 CDR Okay, Jim. Now we've got on the checklist to initiate cabin coldsoak. This involves evaporating, and I don't think we want to do that.
04 16 13 48 CC Okay. Now we talked that over with FIDO, and at 12 hours out, everyone seems to think that we don't need to do it there. But in close, it doesn't seem to have any effect on the trajectory, and what's been suggested if you'd like - we can do over the entry checklist and just kind of walk through it on the air with all the people on the console. Right now, you have the term that will be performing the entry session with you so we can go over the checklist and run down any questions that you might have. That's up to you.
04 16 14 44 CDR That's fine. Let's do that. I've got one right here. I'm lonesome anyway.
04 16 14 48 CC Okay. Give us a few minutes to pull ourselves together and get on the air.
04 16 22 23 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 16 22 28 CDR Go ahead.
04 16 22 29 CC Okay. We've drifted off now about 25 degrees in pitch. I'd like to have you take it back and set up the PTC plane again at pitch of 10 and yaw 45 and set up the PTC under control, and turn your pitch back to minimum impulse. And give us a mark when you have done that, and we'll time the drift rates down here.

    Tape 74
    Page 7
04 16 22 56 CDR Okay.
04 16 25 01 CDR Okay, Ken. I've got them all damped out about as low as I can get them.
04 16 25 05 CC Okay. Fine.
04 16 25 08 CDR I'll put in a roll right now.
04 16 25 10 CC Thank you.
04 16 25 14 CDR It takes me three actuations to get about - just about a degree and a half, or a tenth of a de - 0.15 degrees per second.
04 16 25 23 CC Okay. And give a mark when you release the RATE COMMAND in pitch and yaw.
04 16 25 31 CDR I haven't even got them on.
04 16 25 33 CC Oh, okay. Fine.
04 16 25 35 CDR When I gave you - when I gave you that mark, that was it.
04 16 25 38 CC Real fine. Thank you.
04 16 25 57 CDR It's much more sensitive today than it was when it was heavy.
04 16 26 01 CC Roger.
04 16 26 18 CDR Well, the old earth is getting bigger.
04 16 26 20 CC Good show. Going in the right direction, then.
04 16 26 25 CDR Yes. I was beginning to get worried.
04 16 27 38 CDR Ken, be sure and call me if you see the gimbal angles start to get near gimbal are or anything. I'm a little drowsy still. I don't want to end up with another null attitude, like one is enough.
04 16 27 50 CC Roger. Will do.

    Tape 74
    Page 8
04 16 42 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 16 43 00 CDR Go ahead, Ken. 
04 16 43 01 CC Okay. Would you reinitialize the PTC attitude, and let's try that one more time.
04 16 43 09 CDR Okay.
04 16 45 22 CDR You ready?
04 16 45 23 CC Okay.
04 16 45 24 CDR okay. Three blips.
04 16 45 25 CC Thank you.
04 16 45 33 CDR There she goes.
04 16 45 35 CC Roger.
04 16 45 52 CDR Is it sleepy out down there, too?
04 16 45 54 CC Say again, please.
04 16 45 58 CDR I say, is it sleepy out down there?
04 16 46 02 CC Roger. It's getting pretty good now. I figure it's getting sleepy up there, though.
04 16 46 08 CDR Yes.
04 16 46 11 CC Okay. Well would you believe that the North beat the South 3 to nothing, and they did that all with a first-quarter field goal. 
04 16 46 24 CDR Very good. When was the East-West game?
04 16 46 31 CC Oh, about Saturday.
04 16 46 36 CDR Next Saturday?
04 16 46 37 CC Yes, sir.
04 16 46 51 CC And, Frank, we are going over the checklist right now, and I'll get back with you on the entry checklist in a few minutes.

    Tape 74
    Page 9
04 16 46 58 CDR Okay, Ken. I think it is a pretty good one; that's one thing we have practiced a lot. But we might as well let everybody know what we're doing.
04 16 47 07 CC Roger.
04 16 47 43 CDR Ken, while we are just killing time here, there are a couple of anomolies we've noticed. The booties, you know, for the inflight coveralls; mine have frayed very badly, and I had to take them off. Also, we had one Y adapter with an open in it, and the lightweight headsets were kind of useless.
04 16 48 04 CC Roger.
04 16 48 12 CDR I take that back. I really didn't mean to say that. The lightweight headset - what I really meant to say was - the lightweight headsets are useless.
04 16 48 22 CC Okay.
04 16 48 30 CDR But these Snoopy hats are pretty comfortable. We have worn them the whole time.

    Tape 75
    Page 1
04 16 51 58 CDR Ken, one thing we are going to do on these suits, we're going to Stow them one under each seat, the way North American suggested.
04 16 52 06 CC Roger. And you'll be putting the helmets in the food stowage.
04 16 52 16 CDR Yes, I think we'll put the helmets in the food stowage; and any stuff we have to take out of there, we'll just stick in a suit.
04 16 52 22 CC Okay.
04 16 52 30 CDR Is the weather still good out there?
04 16 52 33 CC It's not quite as clear as it was yesterday; it sure is nice and balmy.
04 16 52 40 CDR No, I mean out at 165 west.
04 16 52 45 CC Okay. Frank, we've got a weather picture here. The forecast shows 2000 scattered and 4000 broken with a high overcast. You might see that as you come down through it, and wave heights 4 feet, wind about 070 at 12 with 10 miles visibility and perhaps some scattered showers in the area, and this is forecast for the twenty-seventh at 16:00 Zulu.
04 16 54 19 CDR Very good; we'll be there.
04 16 54 22 CC Yes, I'm sure you will.
04 16 54 28 CDR I don't think those waves are too high. We're going to have to sit in this heap for about 45 minutes.
04 16 54 39 CC Okay. We'll put in a kit for some small waves.
04 16 54 47 CDR Tell Jerry Hammack if the waves get high, it's his fault.

    Tape 75
    Page 2
04 17 09 51 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 17 09 55 CDR Go ahead.
04 17 09 56 CC Okay. Why don't you drive it back over to the PTC attitude and put it back in ATTITUDE HOLD for the roll, and we're going back in and review the DTO requirement. You have about the same results, it looks like, on a cursory analysis all three times. So we're going to take another look and see if there is any reason to do it again. If so, we'll call you. You can go ahead and put it back in ATTITUDE HOLD now.
04 17 10 23 CDR Okay, Jim. Thank you.
04 17 45 03 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. Radio check.
04 17 45 05 CC Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
04 17 45 11 CDR Okay, Ken. Thank you.
04 17 45 13 CC Roger. It is taking us a little longer to go through and rehash all of the entry checklist than I though, and we are just         about to wrap it up now.
04 17 45 24 CDR No problem. Just watch my gimbal angles for me, and give me a call if they get too close.
04 17 45 29 CC Roger. We will watch them.
04 18 19 19 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 18 19 24 CDR Go ahead.
04 18 19 26 CC We would like to look at a couple more DELTA-V tests on the EMS, and the general consensus is that we don't think there is any particular problem.

    Tape 75 
    Page 3 
We'd like to go ahead and take a look at what you get by running four or five more DELTA-V tests. And prior to that, we'd like to run one of these null bias tests; and since we don't have any way of monitoring any of this stuff on the downlink, I'd like to have you tell us each step when you turn the switch and different orders and things like that. 
04 18 20 08 CDR Okay. 
04 18 20 41 CDR Alright. I'll run a test. 
04 18 20 48 CC Okay. The first thing we want is this null bias, 100 seconds. 
04 18 20 CDR You stand by, and I'll do a null bias for 100 seconds. Do you want me to put DELTA-V in AUTOMATIC and let it alone for 100 seconds?
04 18 21 02 CC That is affirmed. 
04 18 21 22 CDR Going to DELTA-V; going to AUTO - 
04 18 21 25 CDR Now.
04 18 21 27 CC Roger. 
04 18 21 45 CDR Went to one-tenth and back to zero. 
04 18 21 50 CC Understand; plus one-tenth and back to zero. 
04 18 21 56 CDR One-tenth, now it's a minus one-tenth and back to zero; no, it's not zero yet; wait a minute. 
04 18 22 29 CDR Now it's up some, minus 4; 0.4, that is. 
04 18 22 33 CC Roger. 
04 18 22 44 CDR Minus 25.

    Tape 75 
    Page 4 
04 18 22 46 CC Roger. 
04 18 22 53 CDR Minus 26. 
04 18 23 06 CDR Minus 0.7, and there is 100 seconds; minus 0.7 at 100 seconds. 
04 18 23 12 CC Roger. 
04 18 23 17 CDR Now what do you want? 
04 18 23 19 CC Okay. If we go back to mode, switch to stand by and FUNCTION switch OFF. 
04 18 23 36 CDR Roger. 
04 18 23 37 CC Okay. Now we'd like to do a couple of DELTA-V self-tests. 
04 18 23 38 CDR Okay. 71586.8. 
04 18 23 43 CC Roger. 

    Tape 76 
    Page 1 
04 18 24 46 CDR Say you're going AUTOMATIC? 
04 18 24 48 CC Roger. 
04 18 24 51 CDR Going to a DELTA-V test now. Counting down. 
04 18 26 04 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 18 27 14 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 18 28 47 CDR You back, Ken?
04 18 28 49 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. 
04 18 28 53 CDR Roger. Read you. 
04 18 28 55 CC Okay. We got caught in a station handover there. I didn't copy anything after you said you were putting it to DELTA-V test. 
04 18 29 06 CDR I ran - I ran three tests during that handover. Two over minus 19.6 - two of them are minus 19.8; and one of them, minus 19.6. 
04 18 29 17 CC Okay. That sounds real fine. 
04 18 29 22 CDR Roger. 
04 18 29 24 CC Okay. The other thing that - sometime prior to entry - and we're going to be looking at it - is the normal entry test pattern, and it's called out presently in the checklist as something we do around an hour. And we'd like to check if you can read the number on the scroll that is up now so we can see where we are in the test test pattern sequence. We're considering taking a look at one of these test patterns before we get into an hour so we can have more time to 

    Tape 76 
    Page 2 
think about it in the event that there should be something anomalous in it. 
04 18 30 02 CDR Why don't we do it right now? We're on number 8. 
04 18 30 06 CC Okay. Understand; that's number 8, right? 
04 18 30 12 CDR Roger. It takes an awful long time to run them over there anyway. It won't hurt to do one. 
04 18 30 18 CC Okay. If you'll stand by just a second; we're checking to see where we stand in the sequence of events for on pattern 8. 
04 18 32 58 CDR Hey, Ken.
04 18 32 59 CC Yes, sir. 
04 18 33 03 CDR Another little thing about this EMS: you know, we had it set up when we separated from the booster - - 
04 18 33 05 CC Roger. 
04 18 33 10 CDR -- and the shock of the separation - the shock of the pyre's blowing in separation knocked it up to 100 and something.
04 18 33 21 CC Understand. Knocked it up to 100. 
04 18 33 26 CDR Roger. 
04 18 33 27 CC Was the pyro separation enough that the - you felt a sensable g in the bird?
04 18 33 35 CDR Roger. Let's just say there wasn't any question we were separating.
04 18 33 43 CC Roger. Understand. 
04 18 34 00 CDR While you are checking the scroll, find out which entry pattern I should be using this bird in.

    Tape 76 
    Page 3 
04 18 34 06 CC Okay. Will do. 
04 18 39 39 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 18 39 44 CDR Go ahead. 
04 18 39 46 CC Okay. While we are verifying that scroll position - they are talking it over in the back room about that now - I vould like to go ahead and run down the checklist with you for entry. 
04 18 40 00 CDR Go ahead. 
04 18 40 02 CC Okay. Looking on entry 1: the second item there is the 12-hour Kelvin cold soak, and in discussions I here and preflight, I think it is agreed that we don't want to do the cold soak there. So we are going to delete that step 2. And what it amounts to is, I think we do want to do a cold soak, and we certainly want to exercise the water boilers prior to entry in order to insure that we don't have one that is dried out, in the same manner that we had one dried out prior to LOI. And we are vorking on some procedures for that, and we'll have to come back to you with those a little bit later, and we will try to do it sometime when Bill's on the line so that everybody can get in on the loop at the same time. We would like to add a step between 8 and 9, or as part of step 8. This is all on page E-1, where we turn the VHF to Simplex A at minus 4 hours and 35 minutes. Now this will be beyond two-way VHF range, but it will make sure

    Tape 76 
    Page 4 
that we do have it on at the time when we pick it up. We were able to get out to 20 000 miles with a downlink, and we are checking on the uplink signal. So if we put it on at this point, we know we have it on well in advance of any time we might be able to get into the VHF. 
04 18 41 36 CDR Okay. 
04 18 41 43 CC Okay. I guess maybe I have that backwards. They copy - you folks copied the VHF out to 20 KM. We're checking on the - on the downlink into that now. But in any event, this 4 hours and 35 minutes will get it well in advance of that. 
04 18 42 03 CDR Roger. 
04 18 42 40 CC Okay, 8. We just got an answer back on the test patterns. We thought it was - We had 25 test patterns which are allocated to ground test, and these are the ones we've been looking at. Then there are five more that are allocated to flight, and the only difference in these patterns is that the flight patterns have instructions actually written on them; so if we are looking at test pattern 8, that means that we're still working on the ones that were allocated to the ground test, so there was no problem there. And I'll get you a number for which pattern we should be using for entry; working on that one right now. So we would like to go ahead and run through these.

    Tape 76 
    Page 5 
04 18 43 21 CDR I don't mean the - - 
04 18 43 23 CC Say again, Frank. 
04 18 43 25 CDR I don't mean the test pattern. I say, I don't mean the test pattern. We asked them to put the supercircular on the number, the first place on the scroll; I'm sure they did. I'm sure it's the first pattern, but I just wanted to make sure that's right. 
04 18 43 38 CC Roger. That's why we are trying to verify. So - - 
04 18 43 43 CDR You want me to run through a test pattern?  
04 18 43 45 CC Yes, sir. If you would, please. And if you'd tell us each step as you go through it. 
04 18 44 42 CDR Okay. Going through step 1; EMS test 1: wait 5 seconds. There's 5 seconds. Going AUTO. Okay- Indicator lights are all OFF; the range is zero, zero. Now I'm gonna slew the hairline over the notch. Okay. And now we go in EMS test 2. 
04 18 44 45 CC Roger. 
04 18 44 52 CDR Got the 0.05g light; all others are out. 
04 18 44 55 CC Roger. 
04 18 44 58 CDR Go on test 3: far side lower light on 10 seconds; going to set the range counter to 58. Okay. Set at 58; going to test 4.
04 18 45 34 CC Roger. 
04 18 45 50 CDR Beautiful. It's perfect. It's right in the corridor. It comes down and stops at zero, zero.

    Tape 76 
    Page 6 
04 18 45 55 CC Very good. 
04 18 46 04 CDR Go in test 5: perfect again. Okay. Now I go 
    to range set.
04 18 46 34 CC Okay. 
04 18 46 39 CDR In STANDBY. 
04 18 46 43 CC Okay. 
04 18 46 45 CDR Okay. That was perfect. 
04 18 46 47 CC Real fine. 
04 18 47 02 CC Okay, Apollo 8. I'd like to run one more null 
    bias and looks like we will have exercised everything we can get to. 
04 18 47 13 CDR Okay. DELTA-V AUTO, all zeros. 
04 18 48 21 CDR Minus 2. 
04 18 48 24 CC Roger. Understand minus 2. Alright. Is that 
    minus 2 or minus two-tenths? 
04 18 48 39 CDR Two-tenths, three-tenths now. 
04 18 48 42 CC Okay. Real good. That looks like we - - 
04 18 48 44 CDR It looks like we had a lot of noise on the circuit for a while there, Jim. 
04 18 48 50 CC Yes, we did, too; all those electronic glitches 
    I guess. 
04 18 48 59 CDR Okay. One hundred seconds. it's plus - minus 
    four-tenths. 
04 18 49 02 CC Okay. Real fine. That looks like that's about 
    all of the functions that we can check, and 
    looks like everything is just down the line. 

    Tape 76 
    Page 7 
04 18 49 15 CDR Roger. 
04 18 49 19 CC Okay. We still owe you confirmation that you 
    can expect your high speed scroll to be the first 
    pattern you come to, and I'll let you know as 
    soon as they come in with an answer on it. 
04 18 49 32 CDR Cksy . 
04 18 49 32 CC I'd like to go ahead and finish going through 
    the entry book if you're ready. 
04 18 49 37 CDR Roger. 
04 18 49 43 CC Okay. We've reviewed most of the book up here, 
    and we will have to come back and suggest a way 
    that we can check out the water boiler prior to 
    getting reentry area. We've reviewed all of the 
    last minutes changes that were put in - pen and 
    ink type things - and they're all looking good. 
    On page E-7, like to add a couple of items. 
04 18 50 15 CDR What's that? 
04 18 50 16 CC Okay. On step 34 under final stowage, which is 
    a sort of catch-all area, there's a step that 
    says secondary glycol to radiator that bypass 
    verify. While we are down in this area, we 
    would like to go to panel 382, the water control 
    panel, and set up the evaporator water control 
    valve both primary and secondary to AUTO. Now 
    this is something we would have done had we done 
    the cold soak at minus 12 hours, but since we
 
    Tape 76 
    Page 8 
    weren't doing it there, we would like to go 
    ahead and make sure we have these in AUTO, and 
    this will enable automatic controls from the 
    panel. 
04 18 51 02 CDR Can we just make this part of the procedure 
    when we test out the water boilers beforehand? 
04 18 51 08 CC Yes, sir. If we get that checked out earlier, 
    we can just leave them in AUTO. 
04 18 51 13 CDR I'd rather do that. 
04 18 51 15 CC Okay. I'm just going to make a note here, and  we can do it the other way, too. The other 
    item that Kas pen-and-inked in - - 
04 18 51 23 CDR ... 
04 18 51 27 CC You may already have this down as step 35. It 
    says UP TELEMETRY to BLOCK, VERIFY, and there's 
    a step right after that that says RCS command 
    module heaters to circuit breakers CLOSED. 
04 18 51 43 CDR Roger. 
04 18 51 48 CC Okay. 
04 18 51 49 CDR I have that. 
04 18 51 50 CC Okay. I guess that one was sent up to you this 
    afternoon. And when you turn the page over to 
    E-8, it shows the EMS entry check being run at 
    minus an hour, and you know that it's a short 
    test. There is really no reason to wait for an 
    hour; we might as well go ahead an2 do that as 

    Tape 76 
    Page 9 
    soon as you get through with step 35 on page E-7 
    because we're coming up on a pretty busy period. 
04 18 52 19 CDR I say that's fine; we'll do that. 
04 18 52 37 CDR Houston, are you still there? 
04 18 52 39 CC Roger. We got a discussion going; be right 
    back. 
04 18 53 50 CC Okay, Apollo 8. On page E-9 - - 
04 18 53 57 CDR Okay. 
04 18 53 58 CC - - at the top of the page, you have step 38, 
    and right underneath that, prior to step 39, we 
    want to have a primary glycol loop activation. 
    What we are doing is to get the glycol evaporator 
    water switch to AUTO and the glycol evaporator 
    steam pressure switched to AUTO. This  will get your primary water boiler on the line 
    prior to entry, or at least it'll enable it. 
04 18 54 35 CDR Okay. Tell me what to write in, Ken. 
04 18 54 37 CC Okay. It's glycol evaporator water to AUTO. 
04 18 55 43 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Are you there? 
04 18 55 55 CDR Glycol evaporator water switch to AUTO. 
04 18 55 59 CC Okay. And the second switch is the glycol evaporator steam pressure to AUTO. 
04 18 56 18 CDR Okay. 
04 18 56 25 CC Okay. That takes care of getting the primary 
    water boiler enabled, and it's my understanding 
    that we were going to make the actual entry with 

    Tape 76 
    Page 10 
    both the primary and the secondary water boilers 
    on the line. 
04 18 56 40 CDR I'm not reading you now, Houston. 
04 18 56 44 CC Roger. How now? 
04 18 56 48 CDR Loud and clear. 
04 18 56 49 CC Okay. There's some question from reading the 
    checklist. It is my understanding that both 
    the primary and the secondary water boilers will be ON for the actual entry, and don't find 
    a place in the checklist where it's actually 
    turned on. So we'd like to get confirmation 
    on that, and we'll make sure that we have all 
    the proper switching to put in the checklist. 
04 18 57 16 CDR Okay. 
04 18 57 23 CC Alright. Still on page E-9 and under step 39 
    at the bottom of the pyro circuit check, there's 
    a step that says panel 8, all circuit breakers 
    CLOSED except and then it lists five that are 
    printed, one that was pen-and-inked before 
    launch. It says EDS power circuit breakers 3 
    OPEN, and to be complete, we ought to add the 
    RCS heater circuit breakers. There's two of 
    those, and they should also be OPEN. 
04 18 58 06 CDR Okay. 
04 18 58 11 CC Alright. The rest of these pages look good; 
    I'm coming over through the graphs. And on 
    page E-11 - - 

    Tape 76 
    Page 11 
04 18 58 48 CDR Roger. I'm with you. 
04 18 58 50 CC Okay. On step 5 on E-11, there's - the first 
    subtitle there is Helmets and Gloves, and the 
    items that follow beneath that are affected by 
    whether you wear suits or come in shirt sleeves, 
    but they do have to be accomplished. And the 
    suit return air valves would actually be OPEN 
    for a shirt-sleeve entry. And you should have 
    a line penciled in of optics power to OFF between 
    an emergency cabin pressure valve and the time 
    when the CMP moves to the couch. 
04 18 59 26 CDR Right. 
04.18 5928 CC Okay. And the step shows the tape recorder to 
    REWIND at minus 30. Now that's an onboard step 
    rather than a ground step, just to verify that. 
04 18 59 48 CDR Okay. 
04 18 59 50 CC Okay. Under step 6, almost at the bottom - in 
    fact, it's three lines from the bottom of 
    step 6 - there's a section that says secondary 
    coolant loop evaporator to RESET, and should 
    be a note that that's 58 seconds if you hold 
    it in RESET prior to moving the pump OFF. 
04 19 00 12 CDR That's it; that's in it. 
04 19 00 15 CC Okay. Okay. The next comment is on page E-13. 
04 19 00 34 CDR Okay. I'm there. 
04 19 00 36 CC Alright. This is a general comment that refers 
    to any time you're working around P62 or when 

    Tape 76
    Page 12
    you're going between P62 and P63, and you should 
    be careful not to call an extended VERB during 
    this time. This is here in the program notes, 
    and it is just a reminder. What will happen 
    if we get into an extended VERB such as an 83 
    or an 82? We may get hung-up in P62 2nd have 
    to recycle through it in order to get the 63, 
    and neither of these displays are normally 
    used, and it's just a good practice. And we're 
    just trying to remind you that we don't want to 
    call an extended VERB while we're in P62. 
04 19 01 22 CDR Okay. Neither do we. That's right. 
04 19 01 24 CC Okay. 
04 19 01 41 CC Okay. In going through the rest of it, we 
    didn't find any other things to make comments 
    on. You have all the latest corrections in 
    your checklist. 
04 19 01 51 CDR Roger. The main thing, that is to come up with 
    a way to determine that the boiler - water 
    boiler is not dry and make sure that Bill gets 
    it activated at TMS 7. 
04 19 02 03 CC That is correct, and we will talk to you some 
    more about that next time we catch both you 
    and Bill up. 
04 19 02 10 CDR Righto. 
04 19 06 41 CDR Ken, this is Frank. I am going to be off the 
    headset for about 5 minutes here. 

    Tape 76 
    Page 13 
04 19 06 44 CC Okay. Fine. When you come back, I will have 
    a systems rundown for you. 
04 19 06 50 CDR Fine. 
04 19 17 12 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. 
04 19 17 16 CC Okay. Loud and clear. 
04 19 17 20 CDR Back with you. 
04 19 17 22 CC Okay. I've got a few good words for you. The 
    erasable memory has been taken completely apart 
    and looked at, and it looks like it's all okay. 
    Your PO1 didn't have any effect. The one thing 
    that might be questionable is if you used a 
    VERB 67 when you get to the NOUN 99 display, 
    you may find that one to be unreliable, and 
    what you're going to get there is the - that's 
    an error display for the W-matrix. And it's 
    something you probably won't be using again 
    anyhow; and if the occasion arises, we can 
    update that one, but it's not a normally used 
    display and everything else, all the operational 
    functions, are good. 
04 19 18 17 CDR Very good. 
04 19 18 19 CC Okay. As of 114 hours, your batteries - you 
    had battery A with 39.32 amp-hours, battery B had 35.21, and battery C 38.46. Your cryo 
    quantities remaining at SSP were the same 
    we gave you the last time, 180 pounds of oxygen 
    per tank and 11 pounds of hydrogen per,tank. At 

    Tape 76 
    Page 14 
    present, the service module RCS, using the 
    computer values for the quantities, you have 
    quad A with 45 percent, Bravo with 50, Charlie 
    with 58, and Delta at 48. What we plan to do 
    with the secondary tanks is to go ahead and 
    turn them on at 37 percent actual, and in the 
    event of lost COMM or something like that, 
    recommend that you use 50 percent onboard 
    gaging as being the time to turn the secondary 
    propellants on. However, as long as we can 
    use our own calculations, why, we might as 
    well leave them tied up. We probably won't 
    get into the seconday propellants prior to 
    entry anyhow. 
04 19 19 41 CDR Roger. 
04 19 19 42 CC Okay. A couple of items I want to check up 
    on: I'd like to confirm that the hatch Dog 
    will be taken off while you're on the chutes 
    if you can. If not, you're going to do that in 
    the water. Is that affirm? 
04 19 20 00 CDR ... 
04 19 20 13 CC Okay. Now we've got a little better sign 1. 
    Like to confirm that the hatch clamps on the 
    side hatch will be taken off either on the 
    chutes or in the water, whichever you can get 
    to. Is that affirm? 

    Tape 76 
    Page 15 
04 19 20 37 CDR Roger. That's affirm. As a matter of fact, 
    we didn't even put - didn't even put them on. 
04 19 20 45 CC Okay. Do you plan to put them on for an entry? 
04 19 20 50 CDR I don't think so. It's held pretty well so 
    far. I don't think - everybody tells me it 
    wouldn't help much anyway. 
04 19 20 58 CC Okay. And we realize we never did find out 
    what happened to the Mae West. Did you leave 
    it blown up, or did you dump it? 
04 19 21 09 CDR We dumped it. 
04 19 21 12 CC Okay. Who was the lucky guy? 
04 19 21 17 CDR The same guy that tried to launch us this afternoon again. 
04 19 21 23 CC Okay. And just as a gee whiz item:you're now 
    a 137 915 out, and you've only accelerated the 
    4883. You might check to make sure you don't 
    have a speed brake hanging. 
04 19 21 41 CDR Uh-oh. 
04 19 21 44 CC Those are nominal values. 
04 19 21 50 CDR Roger. 137 000 miles out, huh? 
04 19 21 55 CC That's affirm. 
04 19 33 18 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over. 
04 19 33 20 CC Loud and clear. 
04 19 33 27 LMP Good morning, or good afternoon, or whatever 
    it is. The JOD is back at the CON; CDR went 
    back to bed. 

    Tape 76 
    Page 16 
04 19 33 32 CC Okay. 
04 19 33 44 CC Looks like all the junior guys have the midwatch. 
04 19 33 49 LMP I know what you mean. I had a little sleep earlier, 
    so I am pretty well rested and want to make sure 
    Frank gets a good snooze here prior to entry. This 
    might be a good time to try out your background 
    music, and see if you have any better luck. 
04 19 34 16 CC Okay. We'll try that a little later. 
04 19 37 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 19 38 43 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 19 38 49 LMP Go ahead, Houston. 
04 19 38 51 CC Okay. I guess we should start off with a little 
    dialogue about sleep. How much did you have? 
04 19 39 03 LMP Well, let's see; whenever it was I told you I went 
    to bed last night till now. Just a second and 
    let me check the flight plan. 
04 19 40 48 LMP Have you got it logged in when it was I asked for 
    that last Seconal? 
04 19 40 57 CC Okay. I guess we can figure that out for ourselves, 
    can't we? 
04 19 41 02 LMP Yes. Why don't you let me know. I have kind of 
    lost track of time it was when I went to bed. But 
    it was about - I went to sleep about 15 minutes after 
    that and woke up about 10 minutes ago. Good sleep. 
04 19 41 12 CC Okay. So I see it is now 142 hours. 
04 19 41 27 LMP What do you think I am, Rip van Winkle? 

    Tape 76 
    Page 17 
04 19 41 30 CC Just trying to find out how soundly you really 
    slept. I guess you are not that sleepy. 
04 19 41 36 LMP . . . but not that. 
04 19 41 40 CC Okay. It's really about 4 hours, Bill. 
04 19 41 50 LMP Okay. Good. 
04 19 42 39 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Have you got somebody under 
    the left couch, or could you get down to the  water control panel? 
04 19 42 49 LMP I can get down there. Frank hasn't quite gone 
    to sleep yet. 
04 19 42 52 CC Well, what we were thinking about doing was boiling 
    a little out of the secondary evaporator to check 
    it out, just as a component check, something we 
    need to do; but if there's somebody down there in 
    the way, why, we can do that some other time. 
04 19 43 17 LMP Well, if it boils, we are going to know it before - 
    it won't take long to find out it won't boil. 
    There's not a heck of a lot we can do about it, so 
    why don't we wait until someone else wakes up here, 
    Frank wakes up again. How will that be? 
04 19 43 27 CC Yes. That would be fine. There is something you 
    can do; you can reservice it. And it is kind of 
    a tedious process, and that's the reason why we just 
    want to kind of keep our eyes on it so we will have 
    some idea prior to entry if we can count on having 
    two loops or one. Which kind of leads us into 

    Tape 76 
    Page 18 
    another question we are trying to pin down, two 
    questions, in fact. Number one, we would like 
    to verify that you do plan to use both primary 
    and secondary boilers during the actual entry, 
    end we are also looking for a way of checking the 
    primary boiler to make sure it isn't dried out prior 
    to entry. And that is turning into a little more 
    of a challenge than you might suspect. If you 
    have any thoughts on that subject, we can go over 
    that. 
04 19 44 21 LMP The answer to the question is yes, we do plan to 
    use both. Before we get into the water boiler 
    pump though, CDR would like to take a Seconal also; 
    make sure he can get off to sleep here. 
04 19 44 41 CC Okay. That's a GO. 
04 19 44 46 LMP Okay. On the water boiler: it's interesting that 
    I get my own - I was going to say anytime you have 
    our mike keyed, I can hear myself talk with about 
    a 2-second time delay. With respect to the primary 
    and secondary boiler checks, I think that is a good 
    idea to make sure we got them both prior to entry 
    and have the reservicing procedures handy. 
04 19 45 39 CC Roger, Bill. You know the secondary - well, in fact, 
    both reservicing procedures are available in a 
    malfunction book, and sort of the problem with checking 
    out the primary boiler is finding a way to 
    make it boil on the way in. 

    Tape 76 
    Page 19 
04 19 46 03 LMP Yes. Just a second, I got another little chore 
    going here. 
04 19 46 39 LMP Roger. It looks like the only way we'll be able 
    to do it would be to shut off the radiators. 
04 19 46 48 CC We were looking for a little more docile way to 
    do that. 
04 19 46 55 LMP Roger. That way would be agreeable to me too, 
    a little more docile way, but they shouldn't 
    freeze up if we did it quickly. 
04 19 47 08 CC Roger. We are talking over several things, you 
    know, like putting the ten-pin valve to MANUAL 
    or partially closing it or some of these different 
    ideas, and something you can think about while 
    you are laying there with nothing else to do. 
04 19 47 26 LMP Yes. We noticed that it had gotten warmer in 
    the cockpit coming back than it was going out. And 
    I remember going out when we manually positioned 
    the ten-pin valve, but we had pretty good control 
    over the glycol evap outlet temperature. So possibly 
    that would be the thing to attack first rather than 
    the radiators. 
04 19 47 49 CC Okay. We've got the back room boys looking at it. 
04 19 47 57 LMP I guess if we do pick a time, though, we ought to 
    pick a time that if something did go haywire, we 
    could afford to boil . . . the rest of the way in, 
    but still leave us enough time to fix - rig up the 
    evap service if it didn't work. 

    Tape 76 
    Page 20 
04 19 48 12 CC That's affirm, and we're factoring in things 
    like trajectory considerations and all that sort 
    of thing, too. 
04 19 48 22 LMP Right. I think that the second derivative of 
    the water boiler versus time plot will give us 
    the optimum time to do it. 
04 19 48 45 CC EECOM's copying that. 
04 19 48 52 CC There's also speculation you have a chart on 
    board that gives that information. 
04 19 49 02 LMP Well, if I don't, I'm sure those guys can ship 
    one up. They've shipped up some other pretty 
    good ones. 
04 19 49 08 CC It's also been suggested that if you don't have 
    the chart it's on the tape recorder. 
04 19 49 18 LMP Well, if I don't have a chart, I'll put it on the 
    tape recorder. 
04 19 49 27 LMP Okay. I think, unless you guys got some more 
    comments along these lines, maybe we ought to 
    give these guys a chance to get to sleep, and 
    I'll recline here for a while. If you've got 
    something to brief me on, well, go ahead; but 
    I'd like to keep my answers to yes's and no's 
    and whatever else you think you really need. 
04 19 49 51 CC Okay. Fine, Bill, and I'll check with you like
    every 30 minutes, just to make sure we still voice contact. 

    Tape 76 
    Page 21 
04 19 50 02 LMP Okay. I've got some log writing to do and whatnot. 
    So keep an eye on the systems and the gimbal angles, 
    and we'll be all right. 
04 19 50 11 CC Okay. 
04 19 52 17 LMP And, Ken, if your EECOM man wants to play the 
    OMNI-switch game, we're on Dog - Bravo at this 
    time, actually on Bravo but also configured for 
    D's - correction, we are on D and also configured 
    for Bravo. If you want to switch, we'll go ahead. 
04 19 52 43 CC Okay, we'll give that a try, and we are cranking 
    up some Background music for you. 
04 19 52 55 LMP Okay. The last time they did that, it sounded 
    like they were running at the wrong speed on the 
    tape, but we're a little closer now. Maybe it'll 
    be a little better. 
04 19 53 02 CC Would you also believe Doppler shift? 
04 19 53 14 LMP Might be another way to range. 
04 19 53 25 LMP Probably it was Doppler shift; we're heading 
    back out again, 
04 19 53 38 CC Looks like we can use your humming for backup 
    ranging in case everything else fails. 
04 19 53 46 LMP Roger. 
04 19 54 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You don't need to answer 
    this transmission, but doctors observe that it 
    looks like your - some of your sensors may be 
    working loose, so you might just kind of push on 
    them and see if they are in place. 

    Tape 76 
    Page 22 
04 19 54 56 LMP That do any good? 
04 19 55 03 CC Looks like it is one of your sternals, Bill. 
04 19 55 21 CC Apollo 8. We can't handle the OMNI switching 
    for about thirty more minutes, till we get back 
    to an 85-foot disk, so you will have to watch 
    the antenna store for a few more minutes. 
04 19 56 05 LMP Okay. I don't see any loose sensor - the upper, 
    upper ... 
04 19 56 18 LMP Are you trying to call, Houston? 
04 19 56 21 CC No, I didn't. It sounded like you were getting 
    an echo, and I checked, and I hadn't held the 
    key down at the time either. 
04 19 56 27 LMP Okay. I don't see any loose sensors, but the 
    upper sternal is beginning to irritate a little 
    bit, but not badly; and possibly there is something going on there. 
04 19 56 43 CC Okay. And did you copy about the antenna? 
04 19 56 49 LMP They really disappoint me, but I'll keep that 
    in mind. 

    Tape 77  
    Page 1 
04 20 02 02 (Start music) 
04 20 02 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston. I'd like to make a voice 
    check with you. 
04 20 03 01 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. 
04 20 03 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. 
04 20 04 13 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. 
04 20 05 12 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. 
04 20 05 46 (End music) 
04 20 05 50 CC Apcllo 8, Houston. Radio check. 
04 20 06 37 CC Apollo 8, Houston in the blind now. We're 
    not receiving down-voice. We have data, and 
    it appears it's probably a ground problem. 
04 20 07 12 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 20 07 17 LMP Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear. 
04 20 07 19 CC Okay. I got you that time. I take it you were 
    able to copy us with the music? Is that affirm? 
04 20 07 28 LMP I was able to copy you all the time, Ken, but 
    I cculd only hear the music when you were trying 
    to tmsmit. And I wondered if you noticed 
    cycling on my suit power switch when you - 
    when you called me. I am hearing an echo now. 
04 20 07 47 CC Roger. I copy your echo. And what switch were 
    you cycling? 
04 20 07 57 LMP I was cycling the suit power which turns off 
    the BIOMED periodically. I figured that would 
    wake the doctors up. 

    Tape 77 
    Page 2 
04 20 08 10 CC It appears that we have more than one communications problem. 
04 20 08 17 LMP Roger. 
04 20 11 25 CC Calm it. (Laughter) 
04 20 11 36 LMP You are cutting out, Houston. 
04 20 11 40 CC Oh, that was sn inadvertent cut-in. 
04 20 11 45 LMP Okay. 
04 20 18 34 LMP You need the high gain, Houston, or will the 
    OMNI's be okay? 
04 20 18 50 CC 8, Houston. That's negative. The OMNI is 
    okay. 
04 20 18 56 LMP Roger. Be advised that about 50 - I am hearing 
    these echos quite a bit of the time, and if 
    you are trying to play music, I am not hearing 
    it. 
04 20 19 06 F Roger. We understand, and we are not trying 
    to play music right now. 
04 20 19 15 LMP Okay. who is this, COMM TECH? 
04 20 19 22 F Ken is only human. This is his substitute; 
    this is Flight Director. 
04 20 19 32 LMP Oh, I didn't recognize your voice there. 
04 20 19 36 F I don't get to talk often. 
04 20 19 37 LMP Who is substituting for you now, Flight? 
04 20 19 43 F DFD. 
04 20 19 46 LMP Okay. Things are looking pretty good from 
    here. How about down there? 
04 20 19 55 F It couldn't be better. 

    Tape 77 
    Page 3 
04 20 20 03 LMP You guys are doing a great job. I really 
    appreciate it. 
04 20 23 23 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Going to be handling over 
    sites at 25. I will make a voice check with 
    you when we come up on the new site, and the 
    ground says thank you for your kind words. 
04 20 23 38 LMP Okay. We will be standing by. 
04 20 25 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston through Honeysuckle. 
04 20 25 42 LMP Roger, Houston. Loud and clear. 
04 20 25 43 CC Okay, Bill, and our BIOMED data still looks 
    a little bit squirrelly. How about checking 
    the blue signal conditioner on your BIOMED 
    harness. You have one connector, should be 
    the center package, has a blue connector on 
    it. You kind of check that, and I don't 
    know if you have changed the BIOMED harness 
    leads recently; if you have, this might have  
    caused our problem. 
04 20 26 18 LMP Roger. I was just cracking open some acorns 
    here for breakfast. Let me put them down, and 
    I will check my BIOMED leads. 
04 20 26 25 CC There is no rush on it. 
04 20 28 21 LMP Everything seems shipshape. 
04 20 49 26 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 20 49 58 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 20 50 02 LMP Go, Houston. 

    Tape 77 
    Page 4 
04 20 50 05 CC Okay, Bill. We're ready to try this music  
    on a different kind of latch-up this time. 
    What I'd like to do in order to make sure 
    that we maintain voice COMM is when you get 
    it if you would, give us a call and tell us 
    you have the music and any comment about its 
    relative volume or anything like that. And 
    if I get your call, then I'll call you back 
    and tell you. And what will happen is when 
    I go to talk to you we'll drop the music 
    link. And we can go ahead and take over the 
    switching of the antennas if you like. 
04 20 50 49 LMP okay. I'm in Bravo Dog switch configuration, 
    and go ahead with the music. Be advised last 
    time the fidelity was low, and the volume was 
    too high. 
04 20 51 02 CC Okay. And if you'll give us the same kind of 
    comment, hopefully not the same comment but 
    the same type of evaluation when you pick it 
    up this time. 
04 20 51 15 LMP Play it a little bit, and we'll talk about it. 
04 20 51 54 (Begin music) 
04 20 52 15 LMP I can barely, barely hear it. 
04 20 53 21 LMP Needs to be just a hair louder. 
04 20 53 37 LMP That's good. 

    Tape 77 
    Page 5 
04 20 53 49 LMP That will keep me awake. 
04 20 54 03 LMP Maybe you ought to crank if. back down a little 
    bit. 
04 20 54 16 LMP Great. 
04 20 54 52 (End music) 
04 20 54 53 CC Apollo 8, Houston. How was that? 
04 20 54 58 LMP That's real good for background level type, 
    Ken. Maybe you can do some logging in here 
    so that's real nice at that level; maybe for 
    anything else it could be a little bit louder, 
    but that's good for now. 
04 20 55 10 CC Okay. Thats about the MAX volume we can 
    take down here; so if you want to talk to us, 
    you may have to call us once or twice. You're 
    just barely equaling it. 
04 20 55 24 LMP Okay. Try it again, and I'll give you a little 
    louder call; I've been trying to keep it 
    quiet. 
04 20 55 30 CC Oh, yes, that's all right. Don't - I was 
    aware you were calling; I just didn't make out 
    what you said. And from now on, any time you 
    call, we'll drop the music, and I'll talk to 
    you. 
04 20 55 42 LMP Roger. Don't hesitate for me a bit. 

    Tape 77 
    Page 6 
04 20 55 46 CC Right. 
04 20 56 00 CC And, Bill, we're going to have to wait until 
    we get around to Bravo before we start switching. Our margin is still a little bit low. 
04 20 56 10 LMP Okay. I'll just go ahead and switch it and 
    save you all that trouble. 
04 20 56 14 CC Ckay. Thank you. Our midnight DVA show's 
    back on the air. 
04 20 56 20 LMP Roger. 
04 20 56 25 (Begin music) 
04 20 57 11 LMP Really great now. 
04 21 14 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Check your yaw gimbal angle. 
04 21 14 58 (End music) 
04 21 15 04 LMP You must have been reading my mind. 
04 21 15 07 CC No, the DSKY's. 
04 21 15 13 LMP Oh, okay. 
04 21 15 21 LMP When you go to high gain, would you tell me? 
04 21 15 46 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. 
04 21 15 53 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8. 
04 21 15 56 LMP Ken, do you want me to use the high gain when 
    we come around, or is the OMNI sufficient? It 
    doesn't matter to me. 
04 21 16 07 CC Okay. The OMNI is doing fine. I was just 
    watching your middle gimbal angle there; it was 
    getting a little far out. 

    Tape 77 
    Page 7 
04 21 16 17 LMP Oh, okay. I thought you - I was, too. I
    thought you said check the DSKY, and I thought 
    you were talking about the high gain antenna. 
04 21 16 23 CC No, I'm sorry. I was just watching your middle 
    gimbal. 
04 21 16 25 LMP Yes, this thing really slops around in deadband, 
    but it's really nice flying otherwise. 
04 21 16 40 CC Glad to hear that. 
04 21 16 47 LMP All I have used the while trip is pulse. 
04 21 16 54 CC You just woke the doctor up. You said pulse, 
    and he came alive. And he'd like to know if 
    you did in fact, check out the BIOMED harness. 
04 21 17 07 LMP Yes, I tightened down all the plugs and checked 
    all the leads, and everything looked in order. 
    And when the other fellows wake up, if you 
    remind me, why, I'll give it a more thorough 
    going over. 
04 21 17 55 CC Okay, Bill. It's been suggested that they would 
    like to see you try switching the two leads, 
    you know, a yellow and a blue one, and just go 
    ahead and switch them, and they'll sacrifice 
    their pneumogram because they'd rather have the 
    EKG. 
04 21 18 25 LMP Do they need it now, or can they wait until 
    somebody else wakes up? 

    Tape 77 
    Page 8 
04 21 18 35 CC I guess we can wait, Bill. Is that a hard 
    thing to get to? 
04 21 18 43 LMP You have to take your pants off and about 
    everything else - stand by. 
04 21 22 07 LMP How's that, Houston? 
04 21 22 13 CC Okay. Stand by, Bill. We'll take a look at 
    it. 
04 21 22 30 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. 
04 21 22 33 CC Roger. Read you. We're looking at data now. 
    (Laughter) 
04 21 22 40 LMP I suppose you'll tell me my heart has quit 
    beating. 
04 21 22 44 CC We couldn't argue with you. That doesn't help 
    at all. That's pretty bad. 
04 21 23 12 LMP Is the pneumogram NO-GO for entry? 
04 21 23 17 CC Roger. 
04 21 23 24 CC 0ne thing you might be interested in: we 
    listened to that low speed information that 
    you taped on the first couple of REV's that 
    we thought was going to be unusable. And it 
    must have been a ground problem because it's 
    coming in loud and clear now. 
04 21 23 41 LMP Hey, that's great. I was just writing a long 
    dissertation on why we have problems and can't 
    use that DSE in low bit rate. So that's real 
    good. 

    Tape 77 
    Page 9 
04 21 23 55 CC Yes, it's coming in loud and clear. Pretty 
    interesting. 
04 21 24 00 LMP Let me tell you, it was a hectic revolution. 
04 21 25 13 LMP If you've got the music going, I'm not hearing 
    it, Ken. 
04 21 25 17 CC No, I was waiting to see what we did on that 
    before I started it up again. 
04 21 25 23 LMP Okay. If they could hold off here for a couple 
    of hours, if they have anything at all, just 
    tell them I'm alive, why, I'll give my real 
    good going over here when I get done. I might 
    even make a statement to the world that I haven't 
    noticed that their little amplifiers had gotten 
    hot. 
04 21 25 41 CC You say it did get hot? 
04 21 25 46 LMP No, I hadn't even noticed it until I started 
    changing the lead. 
04 21 25 49 CC Oh, okay. Okay. I'm going to crank the music 
    up again then. 
04 21 25 56 LMP Okay. Have they got anything at all down there?
04 21 26 00 CC Well, we're on low bit rate right now, so it'll 
    be a few minutes before we get a chance to take 
    another look at it. We'll let you know if you 
    get sick. 
04 21 26 07 LMP Oh, well, we can hold off for a little while. 
04 21 26 13 CC Roger. 

    Tape 77
    Page 10 
04 21 27 02 LMP I can't hear it, but it sounds like something 
    I'd rather not hear anyway. 
ENDOFTAPE 


    Tape 78 
    Page 1 
04 22 17 19 (End of music) 
04 22 17 40 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. 
04 22 17 43 CC Hello, Apollo 8. We interrupt this program of 
    music to bring you the late evening status report. 
04 22 17 50 LMP Good. What's up? 
04 22 17 56 CC Okay. We are getting ready to have a shift turnover, and I wanted to go over a few items before 
    I do. On the midcourse correction number 6: right 
    now, that looks like it is at most 0.3 a foot per 
    second, so there will be no burn for midcourse 
    number 6. Midcourse number 7 is a little larger, 
    and we'll make a decision on that later. Your 
    weather in landing site still reported as being good 
    and the forecast to be about 2000 scattered and 
    12 000 broken, about the same numbers they gave 
    Frank earlier. Visibility will be about 10 miles, 
    wave height about 4 feet. And I guess there is some 
    scattered thundershowers, like less than 5 percent, 
    that you should worry about. And they're 10 to 
    30 percent maybe at 2000, broken as opposed to 
    scattered; so it looks pretty fair. We have got 
    a-- 
04 22 19 12 LMP Just my kind of weather. 
04 22 19 14 CC Roger. Got a couple of flight plan things to 
    consider. Now number 1 at 119:30: we have got a 
    P52 IMU realignment which we need to slip in ahead 

    Tape 78 
    Page 2 
    of the P23 sightings, and that will be an option 3 
    REFSMMAT. 
04 22.19 40 LMP Roger. 
04 22 19 45 CC Okay. Some of the folks in sitting back and 
    looking at the TV business have some ideas about 
    things they would like to see tried with the filters. 
    And I would like to read you what they have here 
    and let you think about it; and in the next 10 hours, 
    you can decide whether or not you think it is worth 
    the effort. Basically, they would like to try using 
    a whole different series of filters - - 
04 22 21 04 LMP Okay, Ken. I got something to write on. Was that 
    P52 at 18:30 or 19:30? 
04 22 21 11 CC 119:30. 
04 22 21 15 LMP Okay. I'm ready to copy on TV. 
04 22 21 31 CC Okay. Before you copy, let me read it all through 
    to you here so you wi11 get the feel for what it 
    is we are talking about. The title of this little 
    epistle is "TV and Film Photography Correlation 
    Experiment," and what they want to do is mount 
    the TV camera with the telephoto lens on a bracket. 
    in the rendezvous window and take a TV picture 
    of the earth through the red and blue filters, 
    1 minute per filter; that means red and blue 
    filters individually. Then they would like to 
    take a TV picture of the earth through through 
    the red, in this case, the 25 Alfa filter combined 

    Tape 78 
    Page 3  
    with the polarizing filter. Rotate the polarizing 
    filter through 360-degree increments, again 1 minute I 
    per position. Then they'd like to take a TV picture 
    of the moon with the polarizing filter at 360-degree 
    moon-rotation increments and again, 1 minute per 
    position. And to go with this, we would like to 
    have Hasselblad pictures. 
04 22 22 44 LMP One minute. 
04 22 22 45 CC Okay. I am standing by. 
04 22 22 49 LMP Are those - when you were talking about pictures 
    through the polarizing filter, is that the TV pictures 
    through the polarizing filter? 
04 22 22 55 CC That's affirmative. All above was TV.
04 22 22 59 LMP Okay. Now the only thing - the only problem here 
    is it's darn near impossible to aim that television 
    camera; the field of view is so narrow that it 
    took three men and a boy up here to get the thing 
    pointed in the right direction. And we tried using 
    chewing gum for a sight and everything else, and 
    let me tell you that the odds of getting that thing 
    in the earth is pretty small. 
04 22 23 25 CC Okay. I think we weren't too clever in our ground 
    callup as to how to point the spacecraft. For one 
    thing I think we can do that a lot better next time 
    now that we have stumbled through it once. I agree 
    with you - - 

    Tape 78 
    Page 4 
04 22 23 41 LMP It's not the spacecraft; it's not the spacecraft 
    that's hard to point, it's the camera. The bracket 
    has sufficient slump in it that it can take the 
    camera out of field of view when configured through 
    the window. And it took a lot of microadjustments 
    with a lot of coaching from the ground to get the 
    thing in, and it was a real tough job. So I think 
    you ought to take all this in mind; if you could 
    possibly use the wide angle, you might be better off. 
04 22 24 14 CC Okay. I understand what you are saying now. I'll 
    run that back by the TV guys and see what they have 
    to say about that. In conjunction with the above, 
    they wanted to take some Hasselblad pictures of the 
    earth through the rendezvous window with the red 
    and blue filter and black and white film, and then 
    again through the polarizing filter, and this is all 
    going to be used in order to try and correlate the 
    TV and the regular film photography. So if you think 
    it is a worthwhile thing, and you would like to give 
    it a try, I'll run this by Jack and the TV cats and 
    see if they would like.to get something out of it 
    with the wide angle, and we can talk about it a little 
    later. 
04 22 25 05 LMP Okay. Another thing to keep in mind is that we 
    haven't seen the moon - we didn't see a11 the way 
    out, and we rarely see it going back. We have seen 
    it once since we left, but we have maneuvered the 

    Tape 78 
    Page 5 
    wrong way from a sighting attitude to the shortest 
    way to PTC and to go from an earth view to a lunar 
    view will take quite a bit of time and some RCS. 
    So you might keep that in mind, too. 
04 22 25 35 CC Okay. I just wanted you to be aware of this and 
    think about it and what its implications to the 
    flight plan might be, and I'll run this wide angle 
    and comment about the moon back by and see which 
    sections they think would be most appropriate. 
    Okay. On the EMS scroll, Frank wanted us to verify 
    the order that he could expect to see the entry 
    profile, and the first profile that comes up is 
    labelled "Nonexit Number 2" and that is the short-range 
    high-speed entry. The second thing that will 
    come up is entitled "The 3500 Mile" which is also 
    high-speed entry, but it is the one you would use 
    in event we go to the longer entry ranges. Then 
    the third profile will be "Nonexit Entry Number 1," 
    and it will be followed by a forth 3500 mile. So 
    you have four entry profiles. Numbers 1 and 3, as 
    you come to them, are the short ranges, and numbers 2 
    and 4 are the long-range scrolls. On coldsoak, 
    I think we talked about what we're going to do there, 
    but somewhere inside of about an hour, we'11 want 
    to get into the coldsoak business. We certainly 
    don't want to do it at 12. Talking to the trajectory 
    people - what they thought about water boiling - 

    Tape 78 
    page 6 
    something to keep in mind is the fact that they 
    do see your water dumps and water boiling on your 
    trajectory plot. It seems to be that it's a function 
    of their computational scheme rather than a 
    function of the fact that the trajectory is being 
    perturbed that much. So it looks like one time that 
    we're going to consider, if we're going to do some 
    of this water boiling, we may do it just prior to 
    the midcourse after all the tracking is settied 
    down and they know what the midcourse correction 
    will be. Then in that period just prior to the 
    midcourse we can do it, and they'll pick up their 
    tracking again following the midcourse correction. 
    So if someone proposes that the - - It is probably 
    nice to know that we are not throwing away our 
    data at the most important time, that it is a function 
    of the computer program rather than so much 
    a function of your trajectory being changed. 
04 22 28 04 LMP Let me ask you one thing then. Do you want a 
    coldsoak sometime prior to the midcourse correction 
    for 1 hour. Is that what you're trying to tell me? 
04 22 28 12 CC Not really. I think we are looking at that prior 
    to the midcourse correction as being the time 
    when we would like to check out the water boilers. 
    The coldsoak does involve some water boiler, too, 
    but that's going to be done right before entry when 
    these things are not going to be very sensitive, 

    Tape 78 
    Page 7 
    and if we don't do it in 12 hours, it is not 
    real clear where the coldsoak takes place or 
    where you turn on the secondary water boiler. 
    In looking through the eniry checklist tonight, 
    we didn't find a place for that. 
04 22 28 48 LMP Okay. Is it really clear that you need the cold 
    soak? We kind of figured on sometime prior to 
    SEP bringing up the secondary EVAP, and also 
    having the primary at that point sometime prior 
    to that date on your suggestion. 
04 22 29 06 CC Okay. We're talking about doing that like an hour 
    prior to SEP; but in the pre-SEP check, one of the 
    things we power down was the secondary loop. And 
    they won't need to turn it back. 
04 22 29 21 LMP Ye do that to save - - 
04 22 29 22 CC Right. We're doing that to keep our power profile 
    where we want it. And then we're going to be turning 
    it back on sometime prior to entry. And the time 
    to turn it on in entry, of course, isn't specified 
    because as you turn it on, the voltages show that 
    they can hack it. 
04 22 29 41 CD2 Hopefully, right after separation. 
04 22 29 43 CC That sounds like a real good place. Okay. I'm 
    sure we're going to discuss that one a little bit 
    more, Bill. But right now those are the kind of 
    things we're talking about doing. And on the 
    high gain, there is still a lot of discussion about 

    Tape 78 
    Page 8 
    as to what - exactly what we saw and what it 
    means. And I think it is a little too early to 
    tell you anything about that one. 
04 22 30 11 LMP Roger. I think it's got X-ray eyes. 
04 22 30 17 CC That's as good as some of the explanations. 
04 22 30 26 LMP Yes, I think that's what they hashed out on the 
    ground, Ken. 
04 22 30 29 CC Okay. I think we all agree that we don't want 
    to try experimenting with it if we really don't 
    know what it is we're looking at. 
04 22 30 39 LMP Roger. I've written down some numbers here that 
    I hope will be helpful. 
04 22 30 43 CC Okay. Fine. 
04 22 30 46 LMP And I'll give them to you in the debriefing. 
04 22 30 49 CC Real fine. 
04 22 30 52 LMP I don't think it's any great big deal, because 
    the antenna switching is not hard at all and the 
    ... is required to work; if it doesn't work as 
    advertised, at least it works in a reasonable 
    manner. 
04 22 31 26 CC Okay. And we're looking at 120 hours for,the next 
    water dump, Bill. 
04 22 33 41 LMP Ken, is it my imagination, or do you have the 
    music running? 
04 22 33 45 CC I'm sorry; say again. 
04 22 33 49 LMP Is it my imagination, or do you have the music 
    running? 

    Tape 78 
    Page 9 
04 22 33 54 CC I think it's your imagination. 
04 22 33 59 LMP Uh-oh. Don't let the doctors hear that. 
04 22 34 01 CC It's too late; he already heard you: 
04 22 34 06 LMP I must be getting that detached feeling. 
04 22 36 49 LMP Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 22 36 51 CC Go ahead, 8. 
04 22 36 55 LMP Roger. Just to make sure the urge to get red 
    and blue filter shots of the moon haven't crept 
    into this TV test. We have got red and blue 
    filter shots of the moon, so you need not worry 
    about that. 
04 22 37 12 CC Okay. I don't think that would throw it away. I 
    think we're trying to come up with something definitive 
    so that postflight will have some real good data 
    to compare with what we do on the ground for future 
    work. I would like to have you go over and take a 
    look at the battery Charlie, please. 
04 22 37 35 LMP I'm on my way. 
04 22 38 08 LMP Okay. Battery Charlie, that's about 36.8 volts. 
04 22 38 13 CC Okay, 36.8. Thank you. 
04 22 38 19 LMP Roger. 
04 22 38 26 LMP Also with respect to the TV test, I would think 
    that we could probably get a pretty good handle 
    on the operation just by taking red and blue and 
    polarizing shots of the earth independent of the 
    TV, but within the same time frame or at about the 
    same range we had the TV last time.
