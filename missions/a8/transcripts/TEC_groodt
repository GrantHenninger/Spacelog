04 16 12 07 CC Okay.
04 16 12 12 CDR Do you want me to take the pitch yaw out of RATE COMMAND, right?
04 16 12 20 CC That's affirmative. You just put it MINIMUM IMPULSE, and then we'll watch it.
04 16 12 34 CDR There you are.
04 16 12 36 CC Okay. Thank you.
04 16 12 38 CDR Have fun.
04 16 12 41 CC Roger. And on that quad temperature - the upper limit of that thing is 105 degrees on the bottle. You are well below that. We have been watching it, and it is tracking, although it is tracking very slowly. As you roll the spacecraft, the temperature excursion seem to be a little sluggish, but it isn't a frozen sensor. And talking a little bit more about that one right now, you might tell Jim the next time he goes to work with the optics, when he works with the trunnion, if he'll go ahead and recycle the ZERO OPTICS switch, he can avoid the problem we had prior to midcourse correction 4.
04 16 13 24 CDR We've done that. And the midcourse correction 4.
04 16 13 25 CC Roger.
04 16 13 26 CDR The midcourse correction number 6 right now looks like zero, and midcourse correction number 7 is approximately 2 feet per second.

04 16 13 38 CDR Okay, Jim. Now we've got on the checklist to initiate cabin coldsoak. This involves evaporating, and I don't think we want to do that.
04 16 13 48 CC Okay. Now we talked that over with FIDO, and at 12 hours out, everyone seems to think that we don't need to do it there. But in close, it doesn't seem to have any effect on the trajectory, and what's been suggested if you'd like - we can do over the entry checklist and just kind of walk through it on the air with all the people on the console. Right now, you have the term that will be performing the entry session with you so we can go over the checklist and run down any questions that you might have. That's up to you.
04 16 14 44 CDR That's fine. Let's do that. I've got one right here. I'm lonesome anyway.
04 16 14 48 CC Okay. Give us a few minutes to pull ourselves together and get on the air.
04 16 22 23 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 16 22 28 CDR Go ahead.
04 16 22 29 CC Okay. We've drifted off now about 25 degrees in pitch. I'd like to have you take it back and set up the PTC plane again at pitch of 10 and yaw 45 and set up the PTC under control, and turn your pitch back to minimum impulse. And give us a mark when you have done that, and we'll time the drift rates down here.

04 16 22 56 CDR Okay.
04 16 25 01 CDR Okay, Ken. I've got them all damped out about as low as I can get them.
04 16 25 05 CC Okay. Fine.
04 16 25 08 CDR I'll put in a roll right now.
04 16 25 10 CC Thank you.
04 16 25 14 CDR It takes me three actuations to get about - just about a degree and a half, or a tenth of a de - 0.15 degrees per second.
04 16 25 23 CC Okay. And give a mark when you release the RATE COMMAND in pitch and yaw.
04 16 25 31 CDR I haven't even got them on.
04 16 25 33 CC Oh, okay. Fine.
04 16 25 35 CDR When I gave you - when I gave you that mark, that was it.
04 16 25 38 CC Real fine. Thank you.
04 16 25 57 CDR It's much more sensitive today than it was when it was heavy.
04 16 26 01 CC Roger.
04 16 26 18 CDR Well, the old earth is getting bigger.
04 16 26 20 CC Good show. Going in the right direction, then.
04 16 26 25 CDR Yes. I was beginning to get worried.
04 16 27 38 CDR Ken, be sure and call me if you see the gimbal angles start to get near gimbal are or anything. I'm a little drowsy still. I don't want to end up with another null attitude, like one is enough.
04 16 27 50 CC Roger. Will do.

04 16 42 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 16 43 00 CDR Go ahead, Ken. 
04 16 43 01 CC Okay. Would you reinitialize the PTC attitude, and let's try that one more time.
04 16 43 09 CDR Okay.
04 16 45 22 CDR You ready?
04 16 45 23 CC Okay.
04 16 45 24 CDR okay. Three blips.
04 16 45 25 CC Thank you.
04 16 45 33 CDR There she goes.
04 16 45 35 CC Roger.
04 16 45 52 CDR Is it sleepy out down there, too?
04 16 45 54 CC Say again, please.
04 16 45 58 CDR I say, is it sleepy out down there?
04 16 46 02 CC Roger. It's getting pretty good now. I figure it's getting sleepy up there, though.
04 16 46 08 CDR Yes.
04 16 46 11 CC Okay. Well would you believe that the North beat the South 3 to nothing, and they did that all with a first-quarter field goal. 
04 16 46 24 CDR Very good. When was the East-West game?
04 16 46 31 CC Oh, about Saturday.
04 16 46 36 CDR Next Saturday?
04 16 46 37 CC Yes, sir.
04 16 46 51 CC And, Frank, we are going over the checklist right now, and I'll get back with you on the entry checklist in a few minutes.

04 16 46 58 CDR Okay, Ken. I think it is a pretty good one; that's one thing we have practiced a lot. But we might as well let everybody know what we're doing.
04 16 47 07 CC Roger.
04 16 47 43 CDR Ken, while we are just killing time here, there are a couple of anomolies we've noticed. The booties, you know, for the inflight coveralls; mine have frayed very badly, and I had to take them off. Also, we had one Y adapter with an open in it, and the lightweight headsets were kind of useless.
04 16 48 04 CC Roger.
04 16 48 12 CDR I take that back. I really didn't mean to say that. The lightweight headset - what I really meant to say was - the lightweight headsets are useless.
04 16 48 22 CC Okay.
04 16 48 30 CDR But these Snoopy hats are pretty comfortable. We have worn them the whole time.

04 16 51 58 CDR Ken, one thing we are going to do on these suits, we're going to Stow them one under each seat, the way North American suggested.
04 16 52 06 CC Roger. And you'll be putting the helmets in the food stowage.
04 16 52 16 CDR Yes, I think we'll put the helmets in the food stowage; and any stuff we have to take out of there, we'll just stick in a suit.
04 16 52 22 CC Okay.
04 16 52 30 CDR Is the weather still good out there?
04 16 52 33 CC It's not quite as clear as it was yesterday; it sure is nice and balmy.
04 16 52 40 CDR No, I mean out at 165 west.
04 16 52 45 CC Okay. Frank, we've got a weather picture here. The forecast shows 2000 scattered and 4000 broken with a high overcast. You might see that as you come down through it, and wave heights 4 feet, wind about 070 at 12 with 10 miles visibility and perhaps some scattered showers in the area, and this is forecast for the twenty-seventh at 16:00 Zulu.
04 16 54 19 CDR Very good; we'll be there.
04 16 54 22 CC Yes, I'm sure you will.
04 16 54 28 CDR I don't think those waves are too high. We're going to have to sit in this heap for about 45 minutes.
04 16 54 39 CC Okay. We'll put in a kit for some small waves.
04 16 54 47 CDR Tell Jerry Hammack if the waves get high, it's his fault.
