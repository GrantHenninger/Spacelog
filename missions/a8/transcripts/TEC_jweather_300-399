02 07 50 32 CDR Okay. We are reading you like that, also. Thank
 you.
02 07 50 38 CC We we having a playback of your TV shows and are
 all enjoying it down here. It was better than
 yesterday because it didn't preempt the football
 game.
02 07 50 57 CDR Thank you. Don't tell me they cut off a football
 game; didn't they learn from Heidi?
02 07 51 10 CC Well, you and Heidi are running neck and neck in
 the telephone call department.
02 08 10 06 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
02 08 10 09 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
02 08 10 12 CDR Hey, Jerry, how much water does this - the water
 dispenser in the lower equipment bay, the one
 that puts out hot and cold water - how much comes
 out of that with each shot?
02 08 10 23 CC Stand by. I'll take a check on that. And, by the
 way, welcome to the moon's sphere.
02 08 10 32 CDR The moon's fair?
02 08 10 34 CC The moon's sphere - you're in the influence.
02 08 10 39 CDR That's better then being under the influence.
02 08 11 00 CDR Hey, Jerry?
02 08 11 03 CC Go ahead, 8.
02 08 11 07 CDR My handy LMP had his schematics out at the drop of
 a hat and informs me that it's 1 ounce per cycle.

02 08 11 29 CC Apollo 8, looks like the flying EECOM the
 ground EECOM came to a dead heat on that one.
02 08 11 39 CDR They did?
02 08 11 40 CC Roger. We got the same answer at the same time.
02 08 11 53 CDR I'll have Bill put it on the tape recorder and
 send it down to you.
02 08 37 05 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 08 37 11 LMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

02 08 37 13 CC Okay, 8. We want to run a little exercise on the
 ground here to make are that we're able to dump
 the tape and bring the voice portion back to
 Houston in a timely manner. So we plan to dump
 your tape, and we're going to exercise the procedure
 on the ground to get it back here and
 take a listen to it. We believe that we have
 something on the tape already unless you have
 recorded over it after the last dump. Just to
 make sure, we'd like to have you just say a few
 words, give us a short count or something on the
 tape and anything else that you might want to put
 on there. And we're going to do this in the next
 5 minutes before we get away from Madrid. That's
 the site we want to exercise, so we'll go ahead
 and do that, and we'll tell you before we make
 the dump.
02 08 38 05 LMP Roger.

02 08 44 20 LMP Houston, Houston, this is Apollo 8. Over.
02 08 44 24 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
02 08 44 29 LMP Okay. Ken, we put 8 few comments on the last of
 the tape after we heard from you, and it's being
 rewound now, and you can have it as soon as we
 get it back to the beginning.
02 08 44 38 CC Okay. We'll have to wait. It looks like you are
 going out of the attitude to use high gain. We'll
 catch it next time around and then dump it.
02 08 44 51 LMP Okay. I know this would be better in high bit
 rate, so it will probably take quite awhile.
02 08 44 55 CC Alright.

02 09 16 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 09 16 49 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
02 09 16 51 CC Roger. Do you think you're in a position where
 you could use the high gain?
02 09 16 57 LMP I'll give it a try.
02 09 19 05 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're dumping at this time.
02 09 19 12 LMP Roger. Tape voice is probable.
02 09 19 21 LMP We ought to also get a check on it at low bit
 rate for DSE voice, Ken.
02 09 19 31 CC Apollo 8, are you saying that everything that's
 on there now is in high bit?.
02 09 19 38 LMP That's where my switch was.
02 09 19 40 CC Okay. We'll take a look at it then. If there
 wasn't anything that was previously recorded
 in low bit, then we'll come back and maybe take
 a look at that, too.
02 09 19 52 LMP Okay. We might get ... if maybe we can get in
 a little closer to the moon to put as big a
 strain on it as we can.
02 09 28 24 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 09 28 30 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
02 09 28 31 CC Okay. We've completed the dump, and the tape
 recorder's back to you. You can use it any way
 you want. We may want to dump that thing again,
 and if we do we'll go ahead and use the same

Tape 39
Page 2
 information unless you have something else that
 you specifically wanted to put on there later.
 Listening to the voice quality - it sounds real
 good. We're coming up on a midcourse 4 and right
 now it's - talking about doing it on time, and
 you can anticipate the burn in the neighborhood
 of 3 foot per second. We're considering and
 would like for you to think about the possibility
 of doing this burn using the onboard vector and
 just have us update the vector in the LM slot, so
 that you will have the MSFN vector on board. But
 it looks like it won't have any big effect on the
 burn results, and it might prove interesting. So
 if you think about that one for a bit and let us
 know if you have any suggestions or thoughts on
 the subject.
02 09 28 39 LMP Roger. You say it uses the onboard vectors and
 leaves the MSFN vectors on the LM slot.
02 09 29 45 CC That's affirmed, if that's what you would like to
 do, right. We considered it, and it looks like
 that would be a reasonable thing.
02 09 29 55 LMP Roger. Frank and Jim are asleep now, and I'll
 bring this up to them when they wake up.
02 09 30 03 CC Okay. Real fine.
02 09 30 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston. How about stirring up the
 oxygen?

Tape 39
Page 3
02093056 LMP Okay. Stand by.
02100638 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 10 06 43 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
02 10 06 45 CC Okay, Bill. I guess I want to belay my last
 about using the onboard state vector for MCC 4.
 After looking at it some more on the ground,
 they've got to get going on making the PAD's
 and doing all their computations, and rather
 than put it off or do it twice, we're going to
 go ahead and go with the procedures we've been
 using all along. On the lunar orbit stuff,
 we've been looking it over and we got several
 guys - Jack Schmitt and company in the back
 room - looking at what effect your windows have.
 And, basically, it looks like there's two options
 that will make an impact on that REV 2.
 One of the options, of course, will be just to
 have you and Jim change seats and let Jim look
 out and get his SAM that way, and another option
 will be to roll the bird over and let Jim point
 the optics as far forward as he can get them and
 take his SAM through the telescope. And I guess
 we'd like to have any thoughts that you folks
 have on what you think you can do with the windows;
 if you have anything, we'd like to factor
 it into our thinking and go ahead and firm up

Tape 39
Page 4
 our plans as early as we can. We'd like not to
 put it off so that we have none of these things
 to do after midcourse. You folks can probably
 tell us more about what you can do with those
 windows. So if you have any thoughts, go ahead
 and sing out with them, and we'll see what we
 can do about factoring that in.
02 10 08 25 LMP Okay. With reference to the midcourse, I think
 that's generally agreed upon, that we do it like
 we've always been doing it. Now, with respect
 to the windows, center windows, essentially, are
 usable. The two side windows are - may be all
 right for observation, and the problem with the
 rendezvous windows is that they're pretty small.
 And I just thought we'd have to play the window
 game by ear almost. Not really sure what capability
 we're going to have. And we'll give you
 some more thoughts on this later.
02 10 09 02 CC Okay. How about exercising the idea of rolling
 over and having Jim do his polarization through
 the telescope because if we have to change attitudes
 we'd like to go ahead and start thinking
 about what effects that'll have on such
 things as antenna orientation and all that.
02 10 09 24 LMP Okay. We'll, I'll mention it to them when they
 wake up.

02 10 30 40 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
02 10 30 42 CC Okay. Apollo 8, we'd like to update your CMC
 clock. This is not to correct errors which we
 have now but just to make up for some effects
 that we're going to have in lunar orbit. And
 what we'd like to have you do is go to P00 and
 ACCEPT and let us update the clock time.
02 10 31 04 LMP stand by.
02 10 31 23 LMP Okay. You got P00 and ACCEPT.
02 10 31 25 CC Roger. Thank you.
02 10 38 07 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 10 38 13 LMP Go ahead, Houston.

02 11 42 24 LMP Houston. Apollo 8. Go ahead.

Tape 40
Page 2
02 11 42 26 CC Okay. We'd like to update CMC. The order that
 we'll update will be the LM state vector, the
 CSM state vector, and then the external DELTA-V
 and the REFSMMAT. So any time you're free with
 it, we can have P00 in ACCEPT; we'll go ahead
 with it.
02 11 42 53 LMP I understand you're going to update LM state
 vector, CSM state vector, and external DELTA-V
 and the REFSMMAT.
02 11 43 00 CC Affirmative. And I'll have one, two, three PAD's
 to read to you.
02 11 43 12 LMP Standby. Okay. You've got P00 in ACCEPT.
02 11 43 18 CC Okay, thank you. And just a minute, I'll be
 with you on the PAD's. They'll be three minute
 maneuver PAD's, one of them MCC 4.
02 11 45 19 LMP Houston, this is Apollo 8. We're ready to copy
 if you read.
02 11 45 22 CC Okay. Stand by.
02 11 45 27 LMP Okay. I thought maybe we had lost COMM here for
 a second.
02 11 45 31 CC No, I'm just behind.
02 11 46 26 CC Okay. Apollo 8, let me just read you midcourse
 correction number 4.
02 11 46 38 LMP Okay.
02 11 46 42 CC Alright. Midcourse correction number 4: the
 RCS/G&N 62888 November Alfa November Alfa 060:59:54.30

02 11 50 48 CC That's correct, Apollo 8.
02 11 51 05 LMP And what else have you got?
02 11 51 07 CC Okay. I've got one for pericynthian plus 2,
 and it's a minimum DELTA-V solution.
02 11 51 24 LMP Roger. Ready to copy.
02 11 51 29 CC Okay. That's pericynthian plus 2. RCS/G&N 62871
 November Alfa, and stand by one. Okay. We'll
 pick up with a pitch trim and yaw trim of not
 applicable; time 071:07:22.16, minus 00468, plus

02 11 56 10 CC That is correct, Apollo 8.
02 11 56 28 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Confirm that boresight star
 and SPA are exactly the same number and not typographical error.
02 11 56 47 CC Roger, Apollo 8. They are checking that. Apollo 8,
 the computer is yours. You can take it back.
02 11 57 00 LMP Roger. Going to BLOCK.
02 11 57 02 CC Thank you.
02 11 59 06 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 11 59 26 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 11 59 35 LMP Houston, this is Apollo 8. Do you copy?
02 11 59 37 CC I do now loud and clear. I've got one more
 PAD for you, and the confirmation that those
 boresight star number and the pitch angle are
 correct at 44.
02 11 59 54 CC Roger. And we are ready to do our P52 preferred
 alignment at this time. Are you ready?

Tape 40

 in the PAD format under longitude NOUN 61,
 that is plus 06500. Over.
02 12 07 31 LMP Roger. That's what I have, plus 06500.
02 12 07 38 CC Okay. That's correct, Apollo 8.
02 12 07 52 LMP And we're ready to copy whatever else you have.
02 12 08 03 CC Apollo 8, let's go back and confirm on your minimum
 DELTA-V pericynthian plus 2 that the pitch
 column is 101; that's the fifth block down.
02 12 08 19 LMP Roger. Pitch. Roger, pitch 101.
02 12 08 25 CC Okay. Thank you very much. And the item we have
 left to go is that we'd like to get with you on
 how you want to handle the problem with windows
 on REV 2.
02 12 08 59 LMP Okay, Houston. Stand by on that, please.
02 12 09 01 CC Roger.

Tape 41
Page 2
02 12 09 02 LMP Houston, this is Apollo 8. We want you to come
 up with a suggested redline for RCS usage during
 lunar orbit, also, please.
02 12 09 12 CC Roger. That's in work.
02 12 09 21 LMP And for your information, Houston, when the sun
 is shining on window 5, it's pretty hazy; window
 number 1 is a little bit better.
02 12 09 34 CC Okay. Thank you.
02 12 10 10 LMP Houston, this is Apollo 8.
02 12 10 20 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
02 12 10 23 CC Apollo 8, go ahead.
02 12 10 26 LMP Roger. We tried to get this realignment. We
 need - Do you have a maneuver to get us some gimbal
 angles so we don't get gimbal lock when we get
 the preferred alignment?
02 12 10 41 CC Stand by on that.
02 12 10 45 LMP Thank you.
02 12 10 49 CMP Houston, on our present position, we'll go into
 gimbal lock. I figure to try and get the preferred
 angle.
02 12 10 57 CC Say again, Apollo 8.
02 12 11 01 CMP In running through PROGRAM 52, we got a PROGRAM
 ALARM 401 which would indicate that if we continued,
 we'd drive it into gimbal lock.
02 12 11 12 CC Roger. I understand.
02 12 12 11 CC Apollo 8, Houston.  This should be an OPTION 1
 like OPTION 3.

Tape 41
Page 3
02 12 12 23 CMP Houston, we're doing an OPTION 1 like OPTION 3.
 We keep getting a 401 ALARM, which says desired
 RCTU yields gimbal lock.
02 12 12 34 CC Roger. Stand by.
02 12 19 14 CC Apollo 8, Houston. It appears that you have
 maneuvered around the gimbal locks system.
02 12 19 22 CDR Roger. Roger.
02 12 19 25 CC Okay. Sorry we were late on that answer.
02 12 19 30 CDR Thank you.
02 12 21 20 CC Houston, Apollo 8.
02 12 21 22 CC Go ahead.
02 12 21 26 CMP Well, we stopped and went through coarse align
 of P52 and then we got fine align, and pick-a-pair,
 pick Capella, but she drove and didn't get
 to any place. I didn't pick Capella, and I can't
 recognize any out there right now. Can I re-cycle
 here and go back and pick a pair?
02 12 21 54 CC That's affirmative, Apollo 8.
02 12 25 27 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
02 12 25 30 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
02 12 25 33 CMP My plan is to go back into re-enter PROGRAM 52 -
 well, it did not drive to Capella, and I can't
 recognize it in the scanning telescope. My plan
 is to go back into recall P52.
02 12 25 50 CC Okay. Stand by one.
02 12 25 54 CC Apollo 8, can you confirm that you zeroed the
 optics prior to starting?

Tape 41
Page 4
02 12 26 02 CMP Roger. That's affirmative. We zeroed the optics.
02 12 26 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You have a GO for a second
 try in P52 with an OPTION 3.
02 12 26 43 CMP Okay. I now have Aldebaran in the scanning telescope;
 I might want to call that one instead of
 Capella.
02 12 26 50 CC Okay.
02 12 26 51 CDR I'll see what it comes up with first, though.
02 12 32 23 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. We came up with an unacceptable
 difference in our stars; we're going to have to
 recycle.
02 12 32 29 CC Roger.
02 12 32 33 CDR If we don't get this midcourse in, what will that
 do to our pericynthian?
02 12 32 40 CC Stand by. We'll -
02 12 32 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston. In the event that we don't get
 this midcourse in, we'll still go for an LOI, and
 it's been suggested you might try Mirfak which is
 OCTO 10.
02 12 33 12 CDR That's the one we're trying now.
02 12 33 13 CC Roger.
02 12 51 50 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
02 12 51 52 CC Go ahead.
02 12 51 56 CDR We are all set up and counting down at 8 minutes.
02 12 52 00 CC Roger.

Tape 41
Page 5
02 12 52 08 CC Apollo 8, our data is down right now; appreciate
 making sure you have the tape recorder on.
02 12 52 19 CDR Roger. I am going to go - I'll have to go
 COMMAND RESET. You've got control.
02 12 53 52 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
02 12 53 57 CC Go ahead.
02 12 54 00 CDR Roger. You have some pitch and yaw angles for
 our PTC extra burn.
02 12 54 14 CC Okay, Apollo 8. That's pitch 348, yaw 315.
02 12 54 25 CDR Pitch 348, yaw 315.
02 12 54 30 CC That's affirmative. And would you give us another
 hack on your countdown time?
02 12 54 39 CDR It's 518 17 16 15 14.
02 12 54 45 CC Thank you.
02 12 55 51 CDR Houston, I will give you a mark in 4 minutes.
02 12 55 53 CC Alright. Thank you.

02 12 55 57 CDR MARK.
02 12 55 58 CDR Four minutes.
02 12 57 05 CC Apollo 8, Houston. How about switching the
 BIOMED switch over to the left.
02 12 57 12 CDR Roger. 3, 2, 1 -
02 12 57 16 CDR MARK.
02 12 57 18 CDR Switched.
02 13 01 02 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
02 13 01 05 CC Go ahead.

Tape 41
Page 6
02 13 01 08 CMP Roger. Burn on time, angles nominal, burn time
 about 12 seconds, 0.2 feet per second after the
 DELTA-V<sub>C</sub>, 0 in VG<sub>X</sub>. We have transferred the results
 of the burn over to the left slot VERB 66.
02 13 01 30 CC Roger. And got a couple of items that I would
 like to clean up. We will get you an RCS budget.
 We've got one redline now; we are trying to get
 some firmer numbers for you, and we will have
 those in a little bit. Right now your PTC usage
 is right on the flight plan line, so everything
 looks pretty good there. We want to get a crew
 status report from you. We would like to firm
 up the REV 2 flight plan idea; and sometime at
 your convenience, we would like to take a reading
 of the PRD for the commander and CMP and then
 have you swap them. We are trying to isolate
 the - what the possible reason is for the discrepancies
 or the disparity in the two readings.
02 13 02 29 CMP Roger.
02 13 02 58 CMP And we are maneuvering to the PTC attitude, Houston.
02 13 03 01 CC Roger.
02 13 05 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Could you give us the sign
 of that Z residual?
02 13 05 40 CMP Stand by, Houston. Alright, Houston. Looks
 like we didn't record just the Z. We recorded
 DELTA V<sub>C</sub>, which is minus 0.2.

Tape 41
Page 7
02 13 06 16 CC Okay. Understand.
02 13 06 17 CMP DELTA-V was 0.1, but we didn't get the sign.
02 13 06 24 CC Roger. Understand that was DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> was minus
 0.2. I copied DELTA-V<sub>Z</sub>; ZULU is 0.2. Is that
 incorrect?
02 13 06 39 CMP Roger. It was 0.1, but we didn't get the sign.
02 13 06 44 CC Roger. Thank you.
02 13 06 46 LMP We can get it. We have it on the tape, Houston,
 whenever you want to dump it.
02 13 06 54 CC Roger. Thank you.
02 13 06 57 LMP It'll be about the last 5 minutes worth.
02 13 07 00 CC Roger.
02 13 07 59 LMP Okay, Houston, for the PRD's: CDR is 0.07, CMP
 is 0.64, LMP is 0.80. Note that the CMP's hasn't
 changed since we started and the commander's
 hasn't changed much. We have swapped PRD's;
 commander has LMP, CMP has commander's, and LMP
 has CMP's PRD. Over.
02 13 08 27 CC Okay. Thank you.
02 13 09 53 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
02 13 09 57 CC Go ahead.
02 13 10 01 CMP Roger. Crew status report as follows: water,
 the commander has about 50 clicks so far today;
 CMP 43; and the LMP is 44. We've eaten two meals
 so far today. Day 3 meal A and B; consumed most
 of it except for the hard hard bite, which no one

Tape 41
Page 8
 cares for. Pudding was outstanding. We're at
 a gain of pericynthian now of plus 63 miles.
 Commander and CMP have had a rest period just
 before the midcourse 4 of about 2 hours.
02 13 11 07 CC Roger.
02 13 16 11 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
02 13 16 13 CC Go ahead.
02 13 16 18 CMP We're at a gain of about 20 500 miles from the
 moon at 61:14. How does that agree with what
 you figure?
02 13 19 16 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like you're on the
 secondary loop. We would like to run that for
 about 5 minutes.
02 13 19 28 CDR Roger. We're doing the ECS redundant component
 check.
02 13 19 31 CC Roger. We'll follow.
02 13 19 32 CDR Getting any data now Houston? Guess you are.
 Okay. See you stopped my tape then. I've been
 running for about 3 extra minutes here to record
 the check.
02 13 19 45 CC Roger. We have data now. That was a temporary
 loss.
02 13 19 55 CDR What's the matter? Was it chow time down there?
02 13 19 58 CC Roger. Didn't know you could smell it that far
 away.

Tape 41
Page 9
02 13 20 13 CDR Give me a call when you're satisfied with the
 secondary loop; it's stabilized out here pretty
 well.
02 13 20 18 CC Wilco, and you might tell Jim that our RTCC is
 about 4 miles off; we had 20 496.
02 13 20 34 LMP Fine.
02 13 21 07 CDR We just put compressor 2 on ac 2.
02 13 22 23 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. Do you show battery B as
 voltage dropped some from the postcharge value?
 Over.
02 13 23 51 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Confirm that battery B is a
 little bit lower, and this is attributed to the
 parasitic loads that are on there.
02 13 24 06 LMP Okay. I just didn't see the same kind of drop
 for A. So if you think it's okay, it's fine.
02 13 24 11 CC That's affirm. You don't have the same parasitic
 loads on that; B is actually drawing some.
02 13 24 20 LMP Okay. I guess that's the radiators, huh?
02 13 24 39 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We've seen enough of the
 secondary evaporator. We would like for you to
 wait about 2 minutes between the time you go to
 RESET and the time you turn the pump off.
02 13 24 53 CDR I agree; good idea. And we plan to leave the
 water control in AUTO.
02 13 25 09 CC Roger.
02 13 31 30 CC Apollo 8, Houston.

Tape 41
Page 10
02 13 31 34 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
02 13 31 37 CC Okay. Looking over the - our redundant component
 check, it appears we have not yet checked the
 integrity of the secondary loop radiators; and
 if you haven't done that, sometime we would like
 to open up the secondary radiators but not flow
 through them and just measure the accumulator
 pressure.
02 13 32 03 CDR Stand by.
02 13 32 42 CDR Houston, we don't show that in our pre-LOI check,
 but we're willing to go ahead and do it if you
 want to.
02 13 32 50 CC Roger. We just noticed that it isn't there,
 and, yes, we would like to. You understand that
 we are not proposing that you flow, but merely
 we check for any pressure decay.
02 13 33 10 CDR Roger. Wait till I get my trusty assistant here
 to help me.
02 13 34 20 CDR Okay, Houston. We're going to blow the secondary,
 I mean, open the secondary RAD for 30 seconds now.
02 13 34 27 CC Roger.
02 13 34 38 CDR Looks pretty good.
02 13 34 40 CC Sure does.
02 13 35 05 CDR Okay. They're closed now.
02 13 35 07 CC Okay. Thank you. Looks good.
02 13 35 11 CDR Roger. No meteoroids yet.

02 13 38 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston.  You take your tape recorder
 to stop, and we'll reset it then and give it back
 to you.
02 13 39 00 CDR Roger.  It's stopped.
02 13 39 02 CC Thank you.
END OF TAPE

Tape 42
Page 1
02 13 53 18 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 13 53 23 LMP Go ahead.
02 13 53 25 CC Okay. We still need to talk about the REV 2
 attitudes we're going to use here to work
 around the fact that you have a fogged center
 window. Whenever that's convenient, we'd like
 to go over what your thoughts are on the subject
 so we can make sure we can get our flight
 plan squared away.
02 13 53 47 LMP My thoughts are to make - to do with the best
 with what we have. We are not interested in
 changing a lot of things right now.
02 13 53 55 CC Okay. The one proposal that sounds like it
 has some advantage to it: if we let Jim do
 his evaluation through the telescope, you do
 everything exactly the same except you turn
 and roll over 180 degrees so that your head's
 up, and let Jim do his tracking through the
 telescope and you'll still be a yaw right when
 you go to pick up your TV and that type of
 thing. It looks like that probably will cover
 everything. We can do that or we can just go
 as is and just have to let some of that tracking
 evaluation go by. Another alternate would
 be to have Jim look out the right-hand rendezvous
 window, and you may have to change your

Tape 42
Page 2
 attitude in order to get the same picture
 there also.
02 13 55 08 CDR I think we'll try to do that, but I don't -
 this is one of the things that we'll work out
 when we get there.
02 13 55 16 CC Okay. The reason we were looking into it in
 the flight plan is, if you do want to try
 rolling over and flying heads up or something
 of that nature, we can help Bill get a little
 more out of his photography by giving him
 some new film settings and that type of thing.
 We'll have something like that available; in
 case you do fly heads up, why, we'll have some
 numbers, we can call up for film settings.
02 13 55 45 CDR Thank you.
02 13 57 15 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
02 13 57 17 CC Go ahead.
02 13 57 22 CDR Roger. We are going to have to dump more
 urine here shortly. Will this bother your
 tracking?
02 13 57 42 CC Apollo 8, we're checking on that with the
 tracking people now.
02 13 58 01 CDR Houston, just give us the time when we can
 start on it, and we'll hold off until you
 say so.

Tape 42
Page 3
02 13 58 06 CC Okay. Add you can anticipate a handover between
 stations here on the hour, and you might get a
 slight glitch as we go through. I'll give you a
 call when we get back.
02 13 58 21 CDR Thank you, Ken. What station are we going to be
 going to, Ken?
02 13 58 32 CC Okay. We'll be going to Honeysuckle.
02 13 58 37 CDR Thank you.
02 13 59 31 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You're cleared for a dump at
 this time, and I understand this is the last gas
 station for a long time.
02 13 59 42 CDR You mean you don't want us to dump after this
 for a while?
02 13 59 45 CC That's affirm. Due to the tracking as you approach
 the LOI, they would like to minimize any
 of these type of perturbations.
02 14 04 06 CC Apollo 8, Houston through Honeysuckle.
02 14 04 11 LMP Roger. Houston through Honeysuckle. We read
 you loud and clear.
02 14 04 15 CC Okay. Good morning.
02 14 04 20 LMP Good morning.
02 14 04 23 CC Thought you went to sleep.
02 14 04 25 LMP You got over to Australia pretty fast.
02 14 04 30 CC Roger. Did that gas station call wake you up?
02 14 04 41 LMP Man, I've been all eyeballs and elbows here
 for the last several hours.

Tape 42
Page 4
02 14 04 57 CC I'll bet. If you've got nothing else to do, I do
 have two charts in your LOI table that I need
 to give you some update numbers on.
02 14 05 04 LMP Standby.
02 14 05 21 LMP We'll get our LOI tables man on the line here.
 Houston. Stand by.
02 14 05 25 CC Roger.
02 14 06 07 CMP Okay; Houston, CMP here. I understand you have
 some updates for me.
02 14 06 12 CC Yes, sir; I've got a couple of charts in your
 chart book under LOI, and I have some numbers
 to fill in, one of them being the chart of LOI
 DELTA-V magnitude versus abort DELTA-V.
02 14 06 35 CMP Okay. Stand by, and I'll get it out.
02 14 06 37 CC Roger.
02 14 07 04 CMP Okay, I have the chart out. Go ahead.
02 14 07 06 CC Alright. Mode 1, 5 hours, roll 1.38, pitch
 7.89, yaw 357.37; Mode 1. 15 minutes, roll
 180.73, pitch 29.46, yaw 1.65. Over.
02 14 08 11 CMP Roger. The new attitudes for the Mode 1,
 5 hour Mode 15 minute are as follows: roll
 1.38, pitch 7.89, yaw 357.37; Mode 1, 15 minute,
 roll 180.73, pitch 29.46, yaw 1.65.
02 14 08 43 CC Okay. That is correct. Now I also have to give
 you a couple of points to plot on that curve.
 The present curve you have drawn is based on
 a 60-mile perigee or perilune, and you right

Tape 42
Page 5
 now have a 62-mile pericynthian; and the reason
 that your target is for 62 miles is to pass over
 the landing site, so I have five sets of coordinates
 for you to copy.
02 14 09 16 CMP Is this to go on the same chart to redraw the
 curve?
02 14 09 19 CC That is affirmative.
02 14 09 24 CMP Okay. Go ahead.
02 14 09 27 CC Okay. We'll go in on the LOI DELTA-V magnitude
 1600, abort DELTA-V 2450, two-four-five-zero.
02 14 09 59 CMP Okay. LOI DELTA-V magnitude 1600, abort DELTA-V
 2450. Stand by just one. I have it; continue.
02 14 10 20 CC Okay. The next one is the LOI DELTA-V 2000,
 abort DELTA-V 3130.
02 14 10 47 CMP Roger. I've got that plotted.
02 14 10 51 CC 2400 LOI DELTA-V, abort DELTA-V 3880, three-eight-eight-zero.
02 14 11 18 CMP I've got it plotted.
02 14 11 20 CC 2800 LOI, abort DELTA-V 4700. over.
02 14 11 46 CMP Roger. I have that one plotted, too.
02 14 11 50 CC Alright. The last one is LOI DELTA-V 2990,
 abort DELTA-V 5114. That is almost directly
 into the end of the present curve, 5114.
02 14 12 20 CMP Say again the LOI DELTA-V magnitude, please.
02 14 12 24 CC Okay. LOI DELTA-V 2990.

Tape 42
Page 6
02 14 12 31 CMP Roger. 2990. Okay. I have it plotted.
02 14 12 49 CC Alright. And on the next one, you should have
 a chart (number 10), and we have three numbers
 to go in there for a Mode 3 gimbal angle.
02 14 13 06 CMP Roger. Go ahead with the Mode 3 gimbal angles.
02 14 13 12 CC Roll 180.87, pitch 42.31, yaw 1.65.
02 14 13 36 CMP Mode 3 gimbal angles are as follows: roll 180.87,
 pitch 42.31, yaw 1.65.
02 14 13 48 CC Roger. That is correct.
02 14 13 56 CMP Could you please send up a French curve for
 me?
02 14 14 00 CC Roger.
02 14 14 03 CDR Send up a couple.
02 14 14 07 CC The only one I have is about 6 foot.
02 14 14 18 CDR Houston, could you give us some gimbal angles
 to point at the moon? I never have seen it
 the whole trip, and I'm wondering which way
 it is from us now.
02 14 14 26 CC Roger. 180.
02 14 16 35 CMP Houston, Apollo 8. Radio check.
02 14 16 38 CC Roger. Loud and clear.
02 14 16 42 CMP Roger.
02 14 16 47 CC We are getting ready to give you a rundown on
 your systems. We're going over all the final
 steps, and we will tell you what we see in

Tape 42
Page 7
 the way of trajectory and systems information.
 And once again, Dr. Joe Kerwin has brought over
 all the latest news, and we can read that up
 to you a little bit at a time if you don't go
 to sleep.
02 14 17 12 CDR What's he going to do, read out of the AMA
 Journal?
02 14 17 20 CC Roger.
02 14 17 23 CMP Go ahead. We are all ears.
02 14 17 25 CC Okay. Here is one: the previously scheduled
 72-hour cease fire by the Viet Cong went into
 effect today, 17 hours before the allied true
 was to begin.
02 14 17 57 CDR You lost us on the numbers there. What was
 that again?
02 14 18 04 CC The gist of it was that the VC went into a
 cease fire earlier than the truce that we had
 planned on, as a Christmas holiday type.
02 14 18 25 CDR Roger. Good.
02 14 21 36 CDR Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
02 14 21 38 CC Loud and clear. Sorry to have stopped on you
 there. We are going over the summary of the
 systems data.
02 14 21 49 CDR Okay.
02 14 31 19 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 14 31 24 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

Tape 42
Page 8
02 14 31 26 CC Okay. I have a rundown on your systems here,
 GNC status. Everything looks real --
02 14 31 38 CDR Just a minute.
02 14 31 42 CC Go ahead.
02 14 31 52 CDR I want to wait until the LMP gets on the head
 set, Houston.
02 14 31 55 CC Roger.
02 14 33 11 CMP Okay, Houston, go ahead. EECOM's on the line.
02 14 33 19 CC Okay. We'll just start with EECOM business,
 then I'll give you a summary of your batteries;
 battery A, we calculate 38.3 amp-hours, battery B --
02 14 33 36 CMP Stand by a second, Ken.
02 14 33 46 CDR Let me get my chart out.
02 14 33 49 CC Roger.
02 14 33 53 CDR Go ahead now.
02 14 33 55 CC Okay. Battery A 38.3, battery B 36.9, battery
 C, 38.5. That's looking pretty good.
 It looks like we got all the things back in
 that we took out, and we're running right
 along prediction. We would like to get a
 battery C voltage from you if you can just
 reach over there and switch it.
02 14 34 28 CDR Roger. Thirty-seven volts, on battery C.
02 14 34 34 CC Roger. Thirty-seven volts, Okay. The predicted
 cryo quantities at SEP: on oxygen

Tape 42
Page 9
 tank 1 170, oxygen tank 2 170, hydrogen 1 9.5,
 and hydrogen 2 10.0. You essentially have
 single cryo tank capabilities all the way at
 full power now.
02 14 35 14 CDR Fine.
02 14 35 17 CC The secondary coolant loop really looked
 good. Looks like you had a nice tight radiator
 and everything else on there was working
 right along the performance curves. Your
 main oxygen regulators both filled at 104 psi
 during our check. Looking at the lunar orbit,
 expect to be doing a water boil of about
 1 pound per hour, and this is just an approximation;
 there's quite a variety of estimates
 as to what the water boiling requirements may
 be, might go anywhere from boiling lots to
 not boiling at all. The next water dump will
 be coming up after TEI, so you don't have to
 worry about any of that until you get through.
 Communications predictions are looking good,
 possibly a little bit better than what we had
 hoped for, and looks like we're going to get
 high bit rate on OMNI's with our 210-foot
 dish at Goldstone. This will be working for
 us on the first couple of rev's, and then
 we'll be switching sites, so we'll go back

Tape 42
Page 10
Comment Ken misspoke, next line meant high-gain, not OMNIs
 to using OMNI's for high bit. The voice quality
 on DSE is good. Your fuel cells have been running
 above nominal for the entire flight, and
 they really look nice and stable. There's been
 some destratification -
02 14 37 04 LMP ... on normal voice, doesn't it?
02 14 37 11 CC Okay. Looks like may not be able to hack the
 normal voice. On the cryo tanks, we've had
 quite a bit of destratification, particularly
 in the oxygen, and you notice this during the
 fan cycles and DELTA-V's, so we're going to be
 sure and we'll remind you again to stir up the
 oxygen prior to LOI. CMC is running along like
 clockwork. G&C tells us that the RCS quantities
 are looking good. You're using the same amount
 as predicted for your PTC and for your alignment.
 What we have in the way of a redline:
 we're going to tell you that you can use
 30 percent per quad in lunar orbit. Now this
 is quite a bit of fuel to play with, and you
 can take 30 percent and subtract that from
 what you have to completion of LOI, and that
 will be a good number.
02 14 38 27 CC On the SPS, the oxidizer and fuel feed line
 temperatures are 75 and holding steady. The

Tape 42
Page 11
 service module RCS quad package temps are
 cycling and holding between 120 and 140, and
 looks like we're getting good normal heater
 operations. We plan to have you in a 60-mile
 circular orbit after LOI 2. And we should
 have some PAD's for you on the LOI burn et
 about 67 hours.
02 14 39 30 CDR Roger. We got all that.
02 14 39 32 CC Okay. We're still going through the tracking,
 and as you know, we're going to hold down on
 the water dumps and so forth during the last
 couple of hours in and out, sort of aid the
 tracking procedures. Everything is running
 along the line normally now. Do you have any
 other specific questions? We are looking for
 an angle on the moon. I guess that about summarizes
 the system. Everything looks GO right
 now.
02 14 40 06 CDR Okay, Ken. Thank you. We just completed
 day 3 meal C, and now are going to break up and
 each take a rest period before LOI.
02 14 40 18 CC Okay, real fine. Everybody wanted to ask
 if you wouldn't try and get some sack time
 here before we go in. It's going to be a big
 day.

Tape 42
Page 12
02 14 40 31 CDR Roger.
02 14 58 21 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 14 58 26 CDR Go ahead.
02 14 58 28 CC Finally found out where the moon is, and your
 present PTC attitude - if you happen to look
 out the right window as you go by - roll attitude
 of 320, it should be there.
02 14 58 46 CDR Thank you.
02 15 06 13 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
02 15 06 15 CC Go ahead.
02 15 06 20 CDR Roger. Bill would like to ask the doctor
 for permission to take a Seconal.
02 15 06 25 CC Okay. Standby.
02 15 08 06 LMP Houston, this is Apollo 8. Did you call? We
 lost track for a minute.
02 15 08 10 CC Okay, Apollo 8. You're cleared to go ahead
 with that pill. Take - Surgeon recommends a
 small one.
02 15 08 21 LMP Small one. Roger.
02 15 10 12 CC Apollo 8, Houston. If you can, we'd like to
 have you stir up the oxygen cryo.
02 15 10 19 CDR Okay, I'll do that right now. Just a moment,
 just the oxygen?
02 15 10 26 CC Okay. We want to get both the oxygen and
 hydrogen.

Tape 42
Page 13
02 15 10 29 CDR Just the oxygen, then?
02 15 10 30 CC No, sir; both the oxygen and the hydrogen.
02 15 10 33 CDR Okay. Start, starting with the hydrogen.
02 15 16 36 CC Thank you.
END OF TAPE

Tape 43
Page 1
02 15 20 01 CDR Okay. Houston, Apollo 8. We've cycled through
 all of the cryo fans.
02 15 20 04 CC Okay. Thank you.
02 15 54 56 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
02 15 54 58 CC Loud and clear, Apollo 8.

02 18 42 11 CDR Okay, Jerry. At 67, we are going over to the
 LO1 1 attitude, do a sextant star check, and
 then we will have to go back to PTC. I want to
 know if you want us to go back to the same attitudes
 we are at now?
02 18 42 24 CC Apollo 8, Houston. That is affirmative, Frank.

02 18 54 50 CMP During the flight, I noticed that the AUTO optics
 wouldn't drive to the star pick-a-pair selected.
 Example, it picked Alpheratz at one time, wouldn't
 drive there, drove to a spot that had no star;
 and I went back and reselected the program and
 came back, and it worked okay.

02 18 55 26 CC Jim, is this anomaly you are talking about - was
 that 4 hours ago when we did the REFSMMAT align?
02 18 55 37 CMP This happened, I think, yesterday. When we - we
 were doing a regular REFSMMAT alignment. Alpheratz
 was the first star selected, and it didn't drive to
 Alpheratz; and I ran and reselected the program
 again, and it worked okay.

02 19 56 10 LMP Roger, Houston. And we'd like to have a check
 of our DSE on low bit rate for voicing.
02 19 56 19 CC Roger. Understand you want the DSE check on
 low bit rate for voice.
02 19 56 30 CDR That's affirmative, and we'll give it about
 10 minutes now or about 5 minutes, then you can
 check it out.

02 21 49 40 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
02 21 49 41 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
02 21 49 47 CMP Roger. For information, we're passing over just
 to the side of the crater Langrenus at this time
 going into the Sea of Fertility.
02 21 49 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.
02 21 51 04 CC Apollo 8, Houston. What does the ole moon look
 like from 60 miles? Over.
02 21 51 16 CMP Okay, Houston. The moon is essentially gray,
 no color; looks like plaster of Paris or sort
 of a grayish deep sand. We can see quite a bit
 of detail. The Sea of Fertility doesn't stand
 out as well here as it does back on earth.
 There's not as much contrast between that and
 the surrounding craters. The craters are all
 rounded off. There's quite a few of them; some
 of them are newer. Many of them look like -
 especially the round ones - look like hits by


Tape 47
Page 5
 meteorites or projectiles of some sort. Langrenus
 is quite a huge crater; it's got a central cone to
 it. The walls of the crater are terraced, about
 six or seven different terraces on the way down.
02 21 52 35 CC Roger. Understand.
02 21 52 40 CMP And coming up now, the Sea of Fertility are the
 old friends Messier and Pickering that I looked
 about so much on earth.
02 21 52 49 CC Roger.
02 21 52 50 CMP And I can see the rays coming out of blaze Pickering.
 We're coming up now near our P-1 initial site
 which I'm going to try and see. Be advised the
 round window, the hatch window, is completely iced
 over; we can't use it; Bill and I are sharing the
 rendezvous window.
02 21 53 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Got any more information
 on those rays? Over.
02 21 53 24 LMP Roger. The rays out of Pickering are quite faint
 from here; there are two different groups going
 to the left. They don't appear to have any depth
 to them at all, just rays coming out.
02 21 53 42 CC Roger.
02 21 53 45 CMP They look like just changes in the color of the
 mare.
02 21 54 08 CC Bill, if you can tear yourself away from that window,
 we'd like you to turn off the secondary evaporator.
 Over.

Tape 47

02 21 54 16 LMP Roger. Going OFF.
02 21 54 45 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. You can leave that
 secondary pump on for just a few minutes. Over.
02 21 54 53 CMP Stand by.
02 21 54 54 LMP Roger.
02 21 55 28 CMP Okay. Over to my right are the Pyrenees Mountains
 coming up, and we're just about over Messier and
 Pickering right now. Our first initial point is
 easily seen from our altitude. We're getting quite
 a bit of contrast as we appear - as we approach the
 terminator. The view appears to be good, no reflection
 of the sun back to our eyes; it appears that
 visibility at this particular spot is excellent.
 It's very easy to pick out our first initial point;
 and over this mountain chain, we can see the second
 initial point, the Triangular Mountain.
02 21 56 33 LMP And we're coming upon the craters Colombo and 
 Gutenberg. Very good detail visible. We can
 see the long parallel faults or grabens, and they
 run through the Mare material right into the highland
 material.
02 21 57 41 LMP We're directly over our first initial point now
 for P-1. It's almost impossible to miss, very easy
 to pick out, and we can look right over into the
 second initial point.
02 21 57 56 CC Roger, Jim.

Tape 47
Page 7
02 21 58 04 CMP I can see very clearly the five crater star
 formation which we had on our lunar chart --
02 21 58 14 CC Roger.
02 21 58 18 CMP -- And right now, I'm trying to pick out visually
 P-1.
02 21 58 28 CC Roger, Jim. Bill, you can turn off the secondary
 EVAP pump now.
02 21 58 40 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8.
02 21 58 43 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
02 21 58 47 CDR Roger. How about giving us a system status,
 please?
02 21 58 51 CC Roger.
02 21 59 19 CMP Okay. I've got P-1 in sight now, Houston.
02 21 59 30 CC Roger, Jim.
02 21 59 32 CMP It's very easy to spot. You can see the entire
 rims of the craters from here with, of course,
 the white crescent on the far side where the sun
 is shining on it. The shadows are quite lengthy
 now. Maskelyne B (Marsh of Sleep) has quite a
 few shadows off of it, but it can be recognized.
 Just west of the Maskelyne B, we start going to
 the terminator. The terminator is actually quite
 sharp over the Pyrenees, and it's - I can't see
 anything in earthshine at this present time. Bill
 says that he can see things out the side window
 when he's not looking down on the sunshine on the
 moon.

02 22 00 50 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. All systems are GO.
 We're evaluating the strip charts on your SPS
 burn, and we'll give you a readout on that
 shortly. Over.
02 22 01 03 CDR Roger. Thank you. It seemed smooth. Do you
 need high bit rate any more?
02 22 01 15 CC Roger. We'd like high bit rate. We have dumped
 your DSE, and we'd like to stick with high bit
 rate for a while.
02 22 01 26 CDR Roger.
02 22 01 45 CMP Well, we're just about over Maskelyne B (Marsh
 Of Sleep) now, and our target is just directly
 below us.
02 22 02 32 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. If you want the recorder
 now, it's yours.
02 22 02 41 LMP Roger. Thank you.
02 22 03 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston. MSFN tracking is comparing
 very well with your onboard NAV.
02 22 03 26 CDR Roger.
02 22 03 31 CDR Houston, for your information, we lost radio
 contact at the exact second you predicted.
02 22 03 40 CC Roger. We concur.
02 22 03 47 CDR Are you sure you didn't turn off the transmitters
 at that time?
02 22 03 52 CC Honest Injun, we didn't.

02 22 04 06 CC Sure will, Frank.
02 22 04 14 CDR We want a GO for every REV please; otherwise,
 we'll burn in TEI 1 at your direction.
02 22 04 21 CC Roger. I understand.
02 22 07 22 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Are you eating?
02 22 07 28 CDR Say again.
02 22 07 39 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Are you eating dinner?
02 22 07 45 CDR Negative. We'll have breakfast in a little while
 here.
02 22 07 49 CC Roger.
02 22 08 00 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. When you go into
 the dark in about 7 or 8 minutes, I have some
 words for you on the filters for the wide-angle
 lens, for your TV camera. Over.
02 22 08 19 CDR We are in the dark now.
02 22 08 23 CC Roger. Let me know when you are ready to copy.
02 22 08 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Any words on earthshine?
 Over.
02 22 09 13 LMP Earthshine is about as expected, Houston. Not
 as much detail, of course, as in the sunlight,
 but you can see the large craters quite distinctly,
 and you can see the albedo contacts quite distinctly.
 And, also, the - there's a good three-dimensional
 view of the rims of the larger craters.

Tape 47
Page 10
02 22 09 43 CC Roger, Bill.
02 22 09 54 LMP I think our high-speed film will be able to
 pick some of this stuff up quite well.
02 22 09 58 CC Roger.
02 22 12 44 LMP Go ahead with your information on the filter,
 Houston.
02 22 12 47 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. We recommend you
 use a wide-angle lens on this particular TV run.
 You can use a telephoto lens with the same setup
 as yesterday's TV show. However, we recommend
 a wide-angle lens. Step number 1, tape the single
 red filter to the red filter on the red/blue
0 filter holder; do it so that the filter slide still
 functions. Over.
02 22 13 38 LMP Go ahead.
02 22 13 40 CC Roger. Step number 2, attach the filter holder
 to the lens with the tape on the top and bottom;
 do this with the slide forward. Over.
02 22 14 04 CDR Go ahead.
02 22 14 05 CC Roger. Then at the end of your second REV TV pass,
 or on request from here, we would like you to remove
 that red filter from the holder and transmit briefly
 with it that way, then slide it over the blue side
 for your final transmission. Over.
02 22 14 27 CDR We got you.
02 22 14 28 CC Okay, Frank.

02 22 16 14 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We have all the SPS experts
 looking at your data now. The preliminary look
 is very good, and we will give you some final
 words later.
02 22 16 28 CDR Roger. We could feel the chug when we threw
 in BANK B, not a chug, but we could feel additional thrust.
02 22 16 37 CC Roger. Copy.
02 22 16 44 LMP Houston, be advised on this red/blue filter
 technique on the TV. You cannot slide the two
 filters out of the way with them taped onto the
 TV camera; so I suggest we do red, blue, and then
 take them off.
02 22 17 06 CC Roger. We concur, but make sure the little red
 filter is taped over the big one. Over.
02 22 17 20 LMP Alright, you don't want the red fil - you want the
 blue by itself. Is that correct?
02 22 17 25 CC That's affirmative, Bill.
02 22 17 33 CC Bill, we'd like you to use the double red filter
 for the first transmission. Over.

Tape 47
Page 12
02 22 17 43 LMP Roger. It worked.
02 22 18 33 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 22 18 43 LMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
02 22 18 45 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. If you should decide
 that you want to roll heads up on REV 2, one
 thing to remember, be sure you yaw 45 degrees
 right in order to maintain your high-gain antenna
 COMM. Over.
02 22 19 01 CDR We will not do that; we're going to stick with
 the flight plan, and make the best we can here.
02 22 19 06 CC Roger, Frank.
02 22 19 CDR As usual, in the real world, the flight plan
 looks a lot fuller than it did in Florida.
02 22 19 18 CC Roger. Understand.
02 22 27 19 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We need an O<sub>2</sub> purge now.
02 22 27 27 LMP Roger. And we're standing by for a map update.
02 22 27 31 CC Roger.
02 22 27 43 CMP Houston, Apollo 8. Just for your information,
 after we completed P52, I acquired the earth in
 the sextant. Quite a sight from here.
02 22 27 57 CC Roger. Bet it is.
02 22 28 11 CDR Row are the systems experts on the SPS coming,
 Jerry?
02 22 28 16 CC They are still working, Frank; another 5 or 10
 minutes.
02 22 28 24 CDR Roger.

Tape 47
Page 13
02 22 28 38 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Your SPS data looks real good.
 It is just a matter of getting it all in from the
 site and getting it looked at.
02 22 28 48 CDR Thank you.
02 22 28 49 CC So far, everything looks copacetic.
02 22 30 42 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We would like to take about
 5 minutes of high bit rate. Over.
02 22 30 50 CDR Roger. Five minutes of high bit rate coming on.
02 22 30 52 CC Roger.
02 22 30 56 CDR You've got it.
02 22 32 14 CC Apollo 8, Houston with a map update.
02 22 32 15 CDR Stand by one.
02 22 32 52 CDR Go ahead with the map update.
02 22 32 55 CC Roger, Frank. Map update: REV 1/2, no change; the
 REV 2/3 follows: 73:04:57, 73:09:37, 73:19:01, 73:48:53,
 74:24:23; remarks: Bravo 1 74:16:24. Over.
02 22 33 49 CDR Roger. Copy.
02 22 33 52 CC Roger. We show you 23 minutes to LOS.
02 22 33 59 LMP Roger. Are you going to dump the tape?
02 22 34 41 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. You are GO for REV 2;
 all systems are GO. SPS evaluation is still underway
 and looking good. Over.
02 22 34 56 CDR Understand; GO for REV 2. Thank you.
02 22 35 00 CC Roger, Apollo 8. We're still using the tape
 recorder. We will dump it in a little bit.
02 22 35 35 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. The recorder is
 yours. You can go to low bit rate.

Tape 47
Page 14
02 22 35 43 CDR Thank you.
02 22 37 55 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Request BIOMED switch center.
02 22 38 04 CDR Three, two, one -
02 22 38 08 CDR MARK.
02 22 38 11 CC Roger. Mark.
02 22 43 50 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Put your TELEMETRY INPUT
 switch to LOW. Over.
02 22 43 57 CDR Roger. GO in LOW.
02 22 44 38 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. We're in the process of
 preparing meal 4, day - correction: day 4, meal A.
02 22 44 47 CC Roger, Frank.
02 22 48 13 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
02 22 48 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
02 22 48 20 LMP Are you going to be able to dump that tape prior
 to LOS?
02 22 48 30 CC Roger. Bill, they say they have already dumped
 the tape, and it's almost totally clean.
02 22 48 42 LMP What does that mean?
02 22 48 52 CC That means you have get about 2 minutes of low
 bit rate on there, but the rest is clean. Over.
02 22 48 59 LMP The high bit rate of the burn wasn't on there?
02 22 49 03 CC Negative. We've already dumped and got that.
02 22 49 18 LMP Okay. Let me know when you're going to dump it
 next time, Jerry. I understand we are GO now
 on the DSE. Have you got any voice off of it?
02 22 49 26 CC That's affirmative. We did.
02 22 49 31 LMP Okay. Thank you.

Tape 47
Page 15
02 22 50 10 CC Apollo 8, Houston. The voice quality on your tape
 was just fair-to-middling; we were able to monitor
 your burn and hear most of that pretty well.
02 22 50 27 LMP Roger. Did you get a report of the photography
 accomplished, or is that on the tape at present?
02 22 50 36 CC Negative. We haven't heard that.
02 22 50 42 LMP Okay. We will put it on the tape now.
02 22 50 46 CC Roger.
02 22 51 53 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You are 4 minutes and 40 seconds
 away from LOS. I would like a reconfirmation
 on your S-band AUX switch in the DOWN-VOICE BACKUP
 position. Over.
02 22 52 09 CDR Negative; it is in the NORMAL voice. We will
 go DOWN-VOICE BACKUP.
02 22 52 17 CC Roger. Request you leave it there forever.
 Over.
02 22 52 22 CDR Roger. In DOWN-VOICE BACKUP now.
02 22 52 44 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. All systems are GO.
 You're still GO for REV 2. Over.
02 22 52 53 CDR Thank you.
02 22 55 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 22 55 37 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
02 22 55 39 CC Roger. One minute to LOS.
02 22 55 44 CDR Thank you.
02 22 56 25 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Ten seconds to LOS. All
 systems are GO.

02 23 39 46 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
02 23 40 42 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
02 23 40 52 LMP Houston, this is Apollo 8 with the TV going.
 Over.
02 23 41 00 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Reading you loud
 and clear. We see your TV. It is a little
 bit - little bit clearer.
02 23 41 15 LMP Roger. The moon is very bright and not too
 distinct in this area. I will give you a shot
 of the horizon.
02 23 41 21 CC Roger.
02 23 41 25 LMP How's that look? Is it on the top of your
 picture?
02 23 41 30 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. It's a good picture
 - the horizon - we can't see many terrain
 features as yet.
02 23 41 41 LMP Roger.
02 23 41 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We are beginning to pick
 up a few craters very dimly; the whole thing
 is pretty bright.
02 23 41 58 LMP Roger. There is not much definition up here
 either out on the horizon. We are now
 approaching the craters See and Bassett.
02 23 42 06 CC Roger.
02 23 42 15 LMP I'll shift to the rendezvous window.

Tape 48
Page 2
02 23 42 18 CC Roger, Bill..
02 23 42 22 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We want to take the DSE.
02 23 42 28 LMP Roger. You've got it.
02 23 42 29 CC Roger. Looks like we've got a real good picture
 now.
02 23 42 35 LMP Okay. That's the crater Brand.
02 23 42 37 CC Roger.
02 23 42 42 LMP Sorry we missed Carr.
02 23 42 43 CC Me, too.
02 23 42 54 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are going to
 need a cryo fan cycle sometime during this pass.
02 23 43 02 LMP Roger. Can we wait till sunset?
02 23 43 06 CC Roger. We can wait.
02 23 43 10 LMP okay. I think we are coming up on Miller
 right now.
02 23 43 53 LMP There's a very new bright impact crater; should
 be in the field of view now.
02 23 44 01 CC Roger, Bill.
02 23 44 05 LMP You see it in the upper part of your screen.
02 23 44 10 CC Say, Bill, how would you describe the color of
 the moon from here?
02 23 44 14 LMP The color of the moon looks like a very whitish
 gray, like dirty beach sand with lots of footprints
 in it.
02 23 44 23 CMP Some of these craters look like pickaxes striking
 concrete leaving a lot of fine haze dust.

Tape 48
Page 3
02 23 44 38 LMP There's some interesting features out on the
 other window. Let me switch windows on you now.
02 23 44 41 CC Roger, Bill.
02 23 44 48 LMP You should see the horizon now in the top of
 your picture.
02 23 44 51 CC Roger. We have the horizon, Bill.
02 23 45 01 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
02 23 45 02 LMP I believe these are the craters now Bassett
 and See.
02 23 45 07 CC Roger, Bill. If you have the polarizing
 filter handy, try flipping it in front, would
 you?
02 23 45 15 LMP Roger.
02 23 45 18 CMP Jerry, as a matter of interest, there's a lot
 of what appears to be very small new craters
 that have these little white rays radiating
 from them.
02 23 45 29 CC Roger, Jim.
02 23 45 50 CC Roger. We see the filter going over it.
 Apollo 8, this is Houston. Looks like we have
 too much light. The polarizing filter doesn't
 help much. Go ahead and remove it again.
02 23 46 16 LMP Roger. It's removed.
02 23 46 25 CC Looks like we just got --
02 23 46 25 LMP Roger. We're just passing over the crater
 Borman, and there's Anders out there; Lovell
 is right south of it.

Tape 48
Page 4
02 23 46 33 CC Roger. The TV is breaking up now. Okay. We
 are back with a good picture. Looks like we
 just have too much light. Our definition is
 rather weak.
02 23 46 49 LMP Roger.
02 23 47 01 LMP Also, we're fogging up the window here, Houston,
 among other problems.
02 23 47 06 CC Roger, Bill. The other window is better than
 that one.
02 23 47 12 LMP Okay.
02 23 47 21 CC Much better picture, Bill; much better.
02 23 47 25 LMP Alright. The right side of the camera is
 pointing retrograde. We are now passing abeam
 of the crater Houston; I will show the camera
 over there once for the folks in Texas.
02 23 47 47 CC Roger.
02 23 47 53 LMP It's a big and sprawly one; it's got those
 two impact craters, one to the right and one
 to the left.
02 23 48 03 CC Roger, Bill.
02 23 48 13 LMP How's your picture?
02 23 48 15 CC Still about the same, Bill. It's - the terrain's
 pretty bright. We are not getting much definition
 at all; definition on this side is much
 much better.
02 23 48 26 LMP Okay. I think - Okay. We are leaving the

Tape 48
Page 5
 window; that gives you an idea how bad our
 window is.
02 23 48 34 CC Roger. This picture now is much better; I
 guess the light levels are decreasing now.
02 23 48 42 LMP okay. We are coming up on the crater Collins.
02 23 48 45 CC Roger. What crater is that just going off.
02 23 48 52 LMP That's some small impact crater.
02 23 48 56 CC Roger.
02 23 48 57 LMP We will call it John Aaron's.
02 23 48 59 CC Okay.
02 23 49 04 LMP If he'll keep looking at the system anyway.
02 23 49 06 CC He just quit looking.
02 23 49 19 CMP Jerry, another ID feature: these small impact
 craters have dark spots in the center where it
 appears that they buried in it and hit some
 new material down below and scattered a lot
 of fine white dust around them.
02 23 49 32 CC Roger. Understand, Jim.
02 23 49 39 CC Apollo 8. This is Houston. Looks like we
 could see Collins now.
02 23 49 48 LMP Roger. There is Collins for you.
02 23 49 52 CMP And Collins is right on the edge of Smythe's
 Sea which we are about to pass over.
02 23 49 57 CC Roger.
02 23 50 24 CC Apollo 8. This is --
02 23 50 26 LMP We are now going across the Smythe Sea. Go
 ahead.

Tape 48
Page 6
02 23 50 31 CC Roger. We just saw a Stellenword go by.
02 23 50 39 LMP Roger. He was really in a hurry.
02 23 50 45 CC Roger. Picture is much improved now; getting
 better all the time.
02 23 50 51 LMP Roger. The terrain here is, as you can see,
 not well defined. We are going to start a
 roll to the left, in order to come across the
 target area, with the television --
02 23 51 15 CC Roger.
02 23 51 16 LMP -- landing site area.
02 23 51 18 CC Roger, Bill.
02 23 51 38 LMP How is that crater in - right in the middle
 look now?
02 23 51 41 CC Roger. That's a very good one; that must be
 O'Neal.
02 23 51 49 LMP Roger.
02 23 52 09 CC Roger, Bill. We see O'Neal real well, also
 the smaller crater off to the side of it.
02 23 52 19 LMP That's Dennis.
02 23 52 21 CC Roger.
02 23 52 38 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8. We are going to
 terminate our program for this pass and get on
 with the preparations for LOI 2, if you say
 we are GO.
02 23 52 49 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Roger.
02 23 52 55 CDR Okay. Signing off until ninth rev. Apollo 8.

02 23 53 00 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.
02 23 53 07 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Thank you for the look.
02 23 53 12 CDR Roger.
02 23 55 02 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. You have the DSE.
02 23 55 08 CDR Thank you, Houston.
02 23 55 10 CC Roger. Apollo 8, on your backside data, it's
 pretty much unintelligible. We suggest, Bill,
 that you recheck the position of your mike for
 your backside pass and try to speak a little
 bit louder and more distinctly. The last one
 we listened to, was pretty much unintelligible.
 Over.
02 23 55 34 LMP Roger. As soon as we get squared away, we will
 give you a real quick real time summary.
02 23 55 39 CC Roger.
02 23 55 56 LMP And, Houston, you might let us know, can we
 do the red/blue filter exercise with both these
 filters - red filters on? Over.
02 23 56 06 CC standby.
02 23 56 10 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Apollo 8, Houston.

 that call 20 minutes before every LOS. Over.
03 00 02 54 CDR Fine.
03 00 03 20 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We have the CSM vector in
 starting on the LV. Over.
03 00 03 27 CDR Thank you.
03 00 03 36 LMP Houston, this is Apollo 8.
03 00 03 40 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
03 00 03 44 CMP Roger. Just an interesting feature: on my
 center window which has ice on it is is now
 beginning to melt. I'm beginning to see
 through it.
03 00 03 53 CC Roger. That's good news.
03 00 03 59 CMP And again we're directly over our favorites,
 Messier and Pickering.
03 00 04 23 CMP The view at this altitude, Houston, is tremendous.
 There is no trouble picking out
 features that we learned on the map.
03 00 04 33 CC Roger. Jim, that's good news. What do you
 think of the lighting situation as far as the
 range of lighting for good visibility?

Tape 48
Page 10
03 00 04 46 CMP The range from here is outstanding.
 I wish we had the TV still going because the brown
 area now is darker. We have just passed over
 the Sea of Fertility, and the mare is darker.
 The mountain range has got more contrast, has
 more contrast because of the sun angle. Bill's
 got the 16 mm going for us.
03 00 05 10 CC Roger.
03 00 05 13 CMP There is a crater Taruntius, I believe, over
 there.
03 00 05 27 CMP We will try to get TV on this at a later time,
 when we are not getting ready for a burn.
03 00 05 32 CC Roger, Jim.
03 00 05 40 CMP I can see the old second bishop right now,
 Mount Marilyn.
03 00 05 47 CC Roger.
03 00 06 18 CMP Houston, at these sun angles, everything is
 quite distinct; shadows are good; the ground
 doesn't have any sunlight returned. It appears
 very good visibility at these sun angles.
03 00 06 30 CC Roger.
03 00 07 02 CMP As a matter of fact, Bill just mentioned that
 the visibility seems to be excellent just about
 up to the terminator. It's something which I
 didn't expect. I thought there would be a
 little bit more gradual shift to darkness, but
 it's very sharp and distinct.

Tape 48
Page 11
03 00 07 15 CC Roger, Jim.
03 00 07 19 LMP Of course, we are in a very high phase angle
 now.

 DSE for a dump. Over.
03 00 18 47 CDR Roger. You got it. I understand we are GO
 for LOI 2.
03 00 18 51 CC That's affirmative.
03 00 18 52 LMP Before you take the DSE for a dump, let me
 give you a quick - let me give you a quick
 rundown on the DSE before you dump it, if you
 will.
03 00 19 01 CC Roger. Standing by.
03 00 19 06 LMP Roger.
03 00 21 02 LMP Okay, Houston. You've got the tape.
03 00 21 06 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.
03 00 21 52 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Would you believe that
 Taurus, Aida is Pleaides? Over.
03 00 22 01 CMP Thank you.
03 00 27 15 LMP Have you got that tape dumped, Houston?
 We're about to lose the high gainer.
03 00 27 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're dumping now - looks
 like we'll be 5 or 10 more minutes.

Tape 48

03 00 27 42 LMP Try to get it dumped, and I'll play it,
 rewind it if necessary -
03 00 27 47 CC Roger. Copy.
03 00 28 55 LMP We are about to lose it, Houston. How far
 are you on the tape dump?
03 00 29 01 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. It looks like we
 have lost it. They weren't quite done. We are
 standing by for a countdown to BIOMED switch
 left. Over.
03 00 29 12 CDR Roger.
03 00 29 14 CMP Look, we would like to get it dumped if we
 could. Standby a second.
03 00 29 18 CC Okay.
03 00 29 19 CDR Did you get it stopped?
03 00 29 30 CC Bill, you can go ahead and turn it off.
03 00 29 54 LMP Obey. We are not going to have a high gain
 now until the next time around. Can you give
 me some idea of how much of that pass you got.
03 00 30 04 CC Apollo 8. this is Houston. We - negative. We
 can't tell. You can go ahead and turn it off.
03 00 30 12 LMP Well, how long did you - did you dump it?
03 00 30 15 CC Roger. stand by; they are checking.
03 00 31 09 CC Apollo 8, Houston.

 ahead and rewind your tape and start it in low
 bit rate, and we will try to catch that dump
 at the end of the next rev.
03 00 31 46 LMP Roger. I would like to have an idea on how
 much you dumped. So I know whether ... all
 these things or whether we have better setting
 in.
03 00 31 56 CC Roger. Stand by.
03 00 32 29 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We are working on that
 time. We should be able to tell you before
 LOS. Over.

03 00 32 53 LMP Go ahead.
03 00 32 54 CC Roger. Did you read my last?
03 00 32 59 LMP That is affirmative. You will give us a run-down
 when you figure out how much tape you
 dumped.
03 00 33 03 CC Roger. They feel reasonably sure, however,
 that if you rewind and start low bit rate,
 we'll be able to get all of the burn and still
 not run into what needs to be down linked yet.
03 00 35 32 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
03 00 35 33 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
03 00 35 34 CDR Roger. What REFSMMAT are we using for this
 LOI 2 burn?
03 00 36 11 CC Stand by, Frank. We're talking.

Tape 48
Page 16
03 00 36 17 CDR Okay. I notice an LOI 2 REFSMMAT. If it is,
 I don't understand why the pitch is 175.
03 00 38 12 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 00 38 17 CDR Go ahead.
03 00 38 18 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. You are right;
 the REFSMMAT is LOI 2. The REFSMMAT was determined
 out there before the last midcourse
 correction, and since that time, there has
 been a slight change of trajectory, and the
 point at which you are burning LOI 2 now is
 just a shade different than where it was
 originally planned. Over.
03 00 38 42 CDR Okay. Thank you.

03 02 32 57 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
03 02 32 58 CC Roger. When Bill gets a minute, we'd like to get
 battery B started charging. Over.
03 02 33 07 CDR Roger. Thank you. He'll take a minute right now.
03 02 36 01 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 02 36 07 CDR Go.
03 02 36 08 CC Roger. For Bill - the voice quality on the backside
 DSE is extremely poor. We consider it unusable,
 and we recommend that all pertinent comments be
 hand recorded so we don't lose them. We should
 not count on using the tape at low bit rate for
 voice.
03 02 36 32 LMP Okay, Houston. We're getting so busy that we
 are having a hard time trying to do a neat job
 of logging. I'll try to do it on the flight
 plan; and if I make any visual observations,
 we'll put them on the DSE, and I'll try to
 scribble some notes here and there.
03 02 36 49 CC Roger. Understand. Now high bit rate is working
 great.
03 02 36 59 LMP Roger.
03 02 38 27 CDR Hey, Houston, Apollo 8.
03 02 38 30 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
03 02 38 35 CDR How about giving us the TV times for the ninth
 REV, will you please?

Tape 50

03 02 38 38 CC Yes, we sure will, Frank. Stand by.
03 02 40 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 02 40 40 CDR Go ahead.
03 02 40 42 CC Roger. We were checking into precise start and
 stop times for TV, and you are GO for the next
 REV. Over.
03 02 40 51 CDR I understand; go for the next REV. Mike, we'd
 like to, if we could, time the TV to a passing over
 the terminator. We would like to track the
 terminator with the TV; think that's the most
 impressive thing we've seen, and that might be
 the best thing rather than trying to acquire
 the earth.
03 02 41 07 CC Okay, Frank. That's one of the things we are
 looking at right now. We have you ending at about
 86 hours, and we're looking at extending that few
 minutes to include that terminator view. Over.
03 02 41 23 CDR okay. I don't want us to run into REV 10 very
 much at all, though.
03 02 41 28 CC Roger. Understand.
03 02 41 30 LMP Houston; Apollo 8.
03 02 41 31 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
03 02 41 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 02 41 37 LMP ... since the DSE qua1 is not so good. How do
 you read, Mike?
03 02 41 43 CC I read you loud and clear. You were cut out
 about the DSE. Say again.

Tape 50
Page 5
03 02 41 50 LMP Roger. Since the qual isn't so good, let me
 give you a quick rundown of the status of photo
 targets. You ready to copy?
03 02 41 59 CC Ready to copy.
03 02 42 05 LMP okay. At REV 1, we got photo target 90 and
 terminator photography south for near-side terminator.
 Starting on REV 2, we've got target
 12 and targets 10, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, and 23.
 Unfortunately, we got into a high - I got into
 the high-speed film there somewhere, and I think
 those 250mm targets were on high speed. We did
 change film, and starting out in Tex - Crater,
 Texas, with target 28, 31, 40, 36, plus several
 targets of opportunity that were recorded on the
 DSE, but apparently lost. Have you been able to
 copy?
03 02 43 13 CC Yes, I'm with you, Bill. Keep going.
03 02 43 18 LMP Okay. I might be calling up too fast. Okay.
 On the third REV, we got target 58 and 63 and 65.
 The training photography was accomplished, and it
 was done on magazine D, which now has - correction,
 that's magazine E - which now shows 95 exposures.
 Magazine D is fresh. Magazine K was also used for
 training photography, and it's showing 0.51.
03 02 44 22 CC Roger. We copy all that, Bill.
03 02 44 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 02 44 37 CDR ... Mike, this is Frank again.

03 02 44 38 CC Go ahead,Frank.
03 02 44 40 CDR Go ahead.
03 02 44 41 CC Roger for Bill.
03 02 44 42 CDR ... around.
03 02 44 46 CC Apollo 8, Houston standing by.
03 02 44 51 CDR I said is Rod Rose around?
03 02 44 54 CC Stand by one, Frank; we'll look for him, and
 while we're doing that, for Bill the DSE voice
 quality on high bit rate is very good, so if
 he wants to use the DSE in high bit rate for a
 limited amount of time to record important
 things, we suggest that he do that. We would
 like him to wait 20 seconds after turning it
 on prior to talking. Over.
03 02 45 28 LMP Roger. Copy.
03 02 45 30 CC Thank you, Bill.
03 02 45 38 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
03 02 45 43 CDR Go ahead.
03 02 45 44 CC Rod Rose is sitting up in the viewing room; he
 can hear what you say.
03 02 45 50 CDR I wonder if he is ready for experiment P1?
03 02 45 56 CC He says thumbs up on P1.
03 02 46 04 LMP Houston, with reference to the DSE on high bit
 rate, what I would like to do this is - if you
 got the last pass - I'd like to play it - run it
 back and start at AOS on low bit rate and then go to
 high when we need it. How would that be?

Tape 50
Page 7
03 02 46 27 CC John Aaron buys it.
03 02 46 32 CDR Okay, Mike. This is Frank again.
03 02 46 36 CC Go.
03 02 46 40 CDR Roger. Rod and I got together, and I was
 going to record a little - say a little prayer
 for our church service tonight. And I wonder -
 I guess that's what we are ready on?
03 02 46 56 CC Stand by one, Frank.
03 02 47 00 CDR Alright.
03 02 49 41 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. Are you still there?
03 02 49 43 CC You're still loud and clear, Frank.
03 02 50 01 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead, Frank, with your
 message.
03 02 50 07 CDR okay. This is to Rod Rose and the people at
 St. Christopher's, actually to people everywhere.
 Give us, O God, the vision which can see thy love
 in the world, in spite of human failure. Give us
 the faith to trust the goodness in spite of our
 ignorance and weakness. Give us the knowledge
 that we may continue to pray with understanding
 hearts, and show us what each one of us can do
 to set forth the coming of the day of universal
 PEACE. Amen.
03 02 50 35 CC Amen.
03 02 50 36 CDR I was supposed to lay-read tonight, and I couldn't
 quite make it.
