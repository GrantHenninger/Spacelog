 and the Apollo 8 crew Tuesday night were the
 first to be relayed across the Atlantic commercially
 by Intelsat III, which was launched
 from Cape Kennedy last Wednesday. That's the
 one we saw go.
03 23 16 37 CDR Roger. I remember that.
03 23 16 40 CC Intelsat is a 63-nation international communication
 consortium; provides a chart on the first
 global communications network. The new satellite
 is scheduled to begin full commercial service
 on January 2, initially serving North and South
 America and Europe. Further coverage of the
 Apollo 8 mission is to be relayed to Europe this
 week.
03 23 17 15 CC From Washington: "This Christmas, the world is
 brightened with the hope of peace. When it
 comes, when hope turns to substance and the guns
 are quiet once again, it will come because you
 have pursued it with courage and skill." This
 was a message from President Johnson to the Armed
 Forces on Christmas.
03 23 17 46 CC Here is a feature by Harry Rosenthal of Associated
 Press. It says: from Houston. Two Santas
 brighten the Christmas Eve for 2-year-old Jeffrey
 Lovell. The first one knocked on his front door
 and brought presents. The second started his

Tape 63
Page 8
 daddy home from the moon. The first wore a
 red suit and a white beard and ho, ho'd loud
 enough to be heard down the block. The second
 was a huge engine spitting flame behind the
 moon, and thousands of people were awaiting
 word that it had fired. "Please be informed
 that there is a Santa Claus" were the first
 words from Apollo 8 as it emerged from radio
 silence to inform an anxious world 15 minutes
 after the fact that the engine had performed
 its critical burn. "None of us ever expect
 to have a better Christmas present than this
 one," said Ken Mattingly of Mission Control.
 "Thank everyone on the ground for us. You
 know we couldn't have done it without you,"
 came the reply from Col. Frank Borman, the
 spacecraft commander. At this point, a Christmas
 tree came aglow in front of the consoles in
 Mission Control, and Astronaut Harrison Schmidt
 read a space version of "A visit from Saint
 Nicholas" to the crew. "Twas the night before
 Christmas, and way out in space, the Apollo 8
 crew had just won the moon race," it began.
 The Mission Control crew had delayed the
 celebration until Jeffrey's daddy, Navy Captain

Tape 63
Page 9
 James Lovell, along with Air Force Major William
 A. Anders and Col. Borman were safely on their
 way home. Any other Christmas Eve, the families
 of the astronauts would have been in church for
 Christmas services, but this year they were all
 glued to their television sets. The homes all
 near the Manned Spacecraft Center were decorated.
 The lawns around the Lovell home and throughout
 his community of Timber Cove were lined with
 Mexican style luminarios, and the four Lovell
 children came out to light them about 7:30. They
 were just in time. At 8:O0, a car drove up
 carrying e tall Santa Claus with a large sack
 on his back. He ho ho'd up to the door and
 knocked loudly. It opened, and there stood
 Jeffrey Lovell who will be 3 on January 14.
 Jeffrey recoiled at the sight. His mother held
 him up, and Jeffrey clung to her, still shying
 away. "Last year he ran away crying," saying
 his 15-year old sister Barbara. Earlier, she
 had to run after him to prevent his blowing
 out all the luminaries. The other Lovell children,
 13-year-old James and 10-year-old Susan watched
 with great amusement. Finally, the Santa and
 the children disappeared inside; the presents

Tape 63
Page 10
 were put under the tree; presents not to be
 opened until today. Mrs. Lovell prepared egg
 nog and cookies for the guests, and they watched
 a 25-minute televised tour of the moon conducted
 by the three astronauts. Later, friends took
 Mrs. Lovell, Barbara, and Jeffrey on a tour of
 the neighborhood brightly lighted for Christmas.
 Above them in a clear sky, the quarter moon shone
 brightly, and the three astronauts, who more than
 any other men have seen the fruits of creation,
 pause in their scientific exploration there to
 beam to the earth the majestic word; from Genesis.
 "And God created the firmament heavens, and God
 called the dry land Earth, and God saw that it
 was good."
03 23 21 22 CDR Thank you, Jerry.

04 00 26 31 CDR We would enjoy it.
04 00 26 32 CC Roger. We will start out with the world news.
 On page 1 of the Houston Post: praise for America's
 Apollo 8 astronauts and hopes for international
 cooperation in space exploration with the worldwide
 Christmas Eve messages as the tiny spaceship
 orbited the moon. Even in the Communist world,
 there was enthusiasm for man's first voyage to the
 moon. In Moscow, Soviet scientist Anatoly Besaranov
 recalled his country and the United States had
 shared space knowledge before and predicted the
 Apollo 8 flight would lead to more cooperation.
 In Cuba, Radio Havana rebroadcast the Voice of
 America program to tell its listeners of the
 Apollo 8 speech. Voice officials said it was the
 first time that any of the U.S. agencies' programs
 had been carried by Havana radio. Czechoslovakia
 saw the moon flight through extensive television
 coverage; and in Budapest, Hungary, people talk of
 little else on the trains and buses. In the
 non-Communist world, office workers and Christmas
 shoppers held their breath as the spacecraft was
 readied for the blast toward earth. Frenchmen in
 the street praised American knowhow and the space
 feat, and some viewers watch television lunar

Tape 64
Page 4
 photos cheer "Magnifique!". In London, swarms
 of Christmas shoppers crowded into shops and pubs
 to watch television photographs of the moon's
 craters. Britain's foremost space astronomer,
 Bernard Lovell, who until a few weeks ago
 criticized the Apollo 8 project on the grounds
 that instruments could do the job without
 risking the astronauts' lives, made it clear that
 he was deeply impressed by the moon flight.
 Pope Paul VI said honor to those pioneers of the
 extension of man's intellect and activity. There
 were only a few scrooges that "pooh pooh-ed" the
 Christmas voyage, however. The most notable
 was Samual Shenton, secretary of London's Flat Earth
 Society, who said the public are being balihooed,
 taken for a ride. How does that grab you, Frank?
04 00 29 00 CDR It doesn't look too flat from here, but I don't
 know; maybe something is wrong with our vision.
04 00 29 07 CC Roger. Elsewhere in the world news, the
 Pueblo crew landed at NAS Miramar yesterday afternoon
 at 14:00, and they will spend a few days
 there in Balboa Hospital with their families
 celebrating Christmas. On the local scene here,
 the Retail Merchants' Association has announced
 that its Christmas gift exchange policy is going
 to be the same this year as it was last year;
 that is, very liberal. Fellows, we will be glad

Tape 64
Page 5
 to replace any broken items that you might bring
 back, too; but, sorry, there won't be any cash refunds.
04 00 30 54 CDR Okay.
04 00 30 57 CC Another little of local news: the County
 Court House at Huntsville burned down before
 dawn yesterday, so it looks like they will go in
 the construction business there again. On the
 feature page: got a little bit about the waiting
 families. This one is by Ann James, Post reporter.
 "We rest on the backside of the moon," said Valerie
 Anders on Christmas Eve, as she and her family
 waited for Apollo 8 to get out of the moon orbit
 and head back toward home. Mrs. Anders had been
 up since 2:00 a.m. Tuesday, and neighbors had
 just collected all the youngsters so the family
 could get some rest while the spacecraft was
 behind the moon and out of communication. Colonel
 Frank Borman's home was decorated with four big
 evergreen wreaths outdoors and sprinkled with
 powdery snow and decorated with red bows. A
 tree in the den awaits his safe return, and his
 pretty blond wife Sue and husky sons, Frederick
 and Edwin, plan to stay home for the midnight
 blast out of moon orbit. Ordinarily, they would
 attend midnight services at St. Christopher's
 L Episcopal Church. The plans were for the family

Tape 64
Page 6
 to go to Christmas Day service at 7:00 a.m. Since
 there are no young children in the Borman home,
 family Christmas gift giving will simply wait
 until Colonel Borman comes back with his fantastic
 holiday gift of the flight to the moon and back.
 Marilyn Lovell's four youngsters will have an
 absolutely normal Christmas as far as the kids
 are concerned, the busy wife of Captain Lovell
 reported; but talking about presents was out
 because two of them were sitting right there next
 to her. "I haven't even had time to change my
 clothes that I wore last night," Mrs. Lovell said.
 Adult-to-adult gifts, however, and the Christmas
 tree will still be right there when Lovell comes
 home. Here is a good one on the Action Line.
 There is a little letter to the Action editor.
 It says, "We intended to pay you Earthlings a
 surprise visit by a flying saucer last night.
 We got scared off by some crazy antics of a
 fat man and a sleigh and three guys in a rocket-powered
 bucket drag racing around the moon. Is
 that anyway to run a planet?" Signed the boys
 from Mars. Frank, it looks like the only people
 around here who aren't impressed by the Apollo 8
 is the stock market. Its 30 industrials are down
 1.43.
04 00 32 43 CDR Neil will be crying.

Tape 64
Page 7
04 00 32 45 CC (laughter) You-bet. On the sports page, not too
 much activity. UCLA is tops in both basketball
 polls. If you got any particular one you want
 to ask about, let me know, and I'll tell you if
 they are in the top ten on either poll. As far
 as the North - the college All Star game that is
 going to be played tomorrow is concerned, the
 North is a slight favorite over the South. Ara
 Parsegian is the coach of the North team, and
 he's got six of the Notre Dame troops working for
 him, so they ought to be pretty tough. The coach
 of the South team is Frank Howard of Clemson. He
 says it ain't easy, he quips, to build a team in
 4 days to play Notre Dame. Another little item
 of interest in the sports page is Woody Hayes from
 Ohio State was named Coach of the Year by the
 Football Writers' Association. Well, that's about
 it. Any questions?
04 00 33 49 CDR No. Thank you very much, Jerry.
04 00 33 51 CC Okay, Frank.
04 00 33 52 CDR Jerry, you can do this every Sunday.
04 00 33 56 CC Do you want me to read you the funnies?
04 00 34 02 CMP No, thanks.
04 00 34 17 CC Hey, Frank, did you get the word that Fred made
 all-district football team?
04 00 34 26 CDR Yes, thank you. I heard about that before - before
 the lift-off.

Tape 64
Page 8
04 00 34 30 CC Yes. I thought you heard about that.. Now, back
 to the workday; we need a cryo fan cycle from you.
04 00 34 43 CDR We're starting right now.
04 00 34 44 CC Roger.
04 00 35 17 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
04 00 35 21 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
04 00 35 25 CMP Jerry, in a little while, I would like to try out
 a little P37 exercise based on minus MA. I'll
 just run one through, and maybe we can get a
 solution from the ground and see how they compare.
04 00 35 38 CC Okay, Jim.
04 00 35 55 CC Retro says they are ready to copy.
04 00 36 02 CMP Roger.
04 00 36 11 CDR That performance at LOI was absolutely fantastic.
 You all really hit it on the money; I just couldn't
 believe it.
04 00 36 26 CC Roger. That kinda surprised us, too.
04 00 36 32 CDR Uh-uh. I hope you're not getting close to the
 earth. We got another corridor to hit, you know.
04 00 36 39 CC We haven't quit yet.
04 00 36 45 CDR Okay.
04 00 42 25 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.

04 00 46 57 CC That's affirmative, Frank. Pitch 10, yaw 45.
04 00 53 29 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston with a battery status
 report.
04 00 53 36 CDR Go ahead. We were just talking about the batteries.
04 00 53 39 CC Roger. At 96 hours EEP, battery A has 38.95 amp-hours;
 battery B has 36.35 amp-hours; battery C has
 38.46 amp-hours. Your total, 113.76 amp-hours. At
 97 plus 50, battery A will be fully charged and will
 have 40 amp-hours, and you can terminate charge at
 that time. Over.
04 00 54 15 CDR At 97:50.

END OF TAPE

Tape 65
Page 1
04 01 02 45 CMP We gave you back VERB 64. I wonder if you could
 have Guidance figure out a corridor correction
 at 114 hours for us with a minus 648 cabin.
04 01 03 03 CC Okay, Jim. We copy, and now we see we've got
 VERB 64 back. We'll be back with you in a
 minute.
04 01 03 12 CMP Roger.
04 01 29 08 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 01 29 13 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
04 01 29 15 CC Roger. We have a comparison now on your P37.
04 01 29 24 CMP Roger.
04 01 29 26 CC Okay. Based on your vector, the CMC vector,
 the ground computes 15.3 feet per second on
 the midcourse, VEI of 36221, a gamma EI of
 minus 6.51 so it looks like your P37 program
 is pretty good. Applying your P37 solution
 to our MSFN vector, however, we get a gamma
 EI of minus 10.32. We expect these two solutions
 to converge with a little more tracking
 and after you get some earth horizon sightings.
 Over.
04 01 30 11 CMP Roger. How valuable do you think that the
 lunar we did just after TPIR as compared to
 your MSFN tracking? Go ahead, Houston.
04 01 30 46 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Repeat your question,
 please.

Tape 65
Page 2
04 01 30 52 CMP Roger. I was getting curious of the value of
 onboard tracking in the P23 course close to
 the moon, in regards to the MSFN tracking that
 close to the moon. I think there might be a
 trail-off for onboard navigation, and I think
 it might be a little bit better than MSFN
 tracking.
04 01 31 20 CC Roger. Stand by.
04 01 33 00 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 01 33 04 CMP Go ahead.
04 01 33 06 CC Roger. I guess the experts would say that the
 MSFN data was probably best based or the number
 of sightings that you have taken. However,
 that's going to be the subject of quite a bit
 of evaluation, I think, after the mission. Over.
04 01 33 24 CMP ...
04 01 33 27 CC Roger, Jim. Be advised that we are beginning
 to read you very weak, and with a rather loud
 background noise.
04 01 33 38 CMP Understand. ...
04 01 33 59 CC Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read now?
04 01 54 04 CMP I'm reading - I'm reading you loud and clear.
04 01 54 06 CC Roger. Still reading you weak but clearer.

04 02 04 34 CMP Roger.
04 02 04 36 CC Roger, Jim. Christmas morning around your house
 was kinda quiet, says Marilyn. She said that
 they are all thankful the mission has gone so
 great. They missed having you around the tree
 this morning, but they wanted to reassure you
 that your presents are waiting, and the roast
 beef and Yorkshire pudding will be on the table
 when you get home.
04 02 04 58 CMP Hey, that sounds good, Jerry - good old roast
 beef and Yorkshire pudding.
04 02 05 02 CC Yeah, man. Is Frank listening?
04 02 05 04 CMP Say hello to them for me, will you?
04 02 05 05 CC Sure will. Is Frank listening?
04 02 05 06 CMP Frank's not on the line yet; he will be shortly.
04 02 05 12 CC Okay. How about Bill? Is he still asleep?
04 02 05 18 CMP Bill is still asleep.
04 02 05 20 CC Okay. Have Frank give me a holler when he is
 ready. I've got a message for him, too.
04 02 05 28 CMP Okay. Sounds good. How is your Christmas,
 Jerry?
04 02 05 31 CC Real good, Jim. Santa Claus struck last night
 before I came in here on the shift, and I guess

Tape 65

 we will finish off the unwrapping this morning
 when I get back.
04 02 05 45 CMP Right. He was looking for a chimney on 103 here,
 but he didn't see any.
04 02 05 50 CC (Laughter) You could have left the hatch unlocked
 for him.
04 02 06 08 CMP I'll think about that one.
04 02 06 10 CC Think real hard, Jim. EECOM says he could
 have slid down the steam duct.
04 02 06 37 CMP Sounds good. About that time, Bill would have
 been boiling water.
04 02 06 53 CDR Hey, Jerry, this is Frank. What's up?
04 02 06 55 CC Hi, Frank. Christmas morning has come at the
 Borman house. And the boys and Susan and
 your Mom and Dad all send their love. They
 say for you to stay in there and pitch. Over.
04 02 07 11 CDR Okay. Thank you. Please reciprocate for me.
04 02 07 16 CC Sure will, Frank.
04 02 07 27 CC Frank, when Bill wakes up, give me a holler.
 I've got a message for him, too.

 morning?

Tape 65
Page 5
04 02 15 41 CC They say they are.
04 02 15 49 CMP I just worked out an answer to move my landing
 longitude 6 degrees east. I just want to compare
 with what they've got based on the same
 burn time of 114 hours, based on the bias impact
 longitude determined from the P37 which is
 wrong. I've indicated that I need 606 foot
 per second DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> burn plus, and my DELTA-V<sub>X</sub>
 changes from a minus 11.6 feet per second. I'd
 like to have them verify that if I could.
04 02 16 29 CC Roger Jim. Standby, and I'll see if they
 copied all that.
04 02 17 30 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 02 17 34 CMP Go ahead.
04 02 17 35 CC The voice isn't too great right now, and the
 Guidance troops didn't get all of that. How
 about waiting about 2 or 3 minutes? We'll swap
 OMNI antennas, and then we should get good voice
 transmission from you and then repeat it.
 Would you, please?
04 02 17 54 CMP Roger.
04 02 17 55 CC Okay.
04 02 22 55 CC Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.
04 02 23 00 CDR Loud and clear.
04 02 23 01 CC Roger. We're reading you much better now.
 Jim can go ahead with his transmission to the

 guidance troops. They have one question before
 he starts. They would like to know what his
 GERU was at TIG, 114 hours. Over.
04 02 23 21 CDR Roger. Wait one. The GERU at TIG was plus
 07972.
04 02 23 35 CC Roger. Plus 07972.
04 02 25 07 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are ready to
 copy your data. Over.
04 02 25 14 CMP Okay, Houston. Based on the P37 with minus
 MA solution, I got an impact longitude of
 minus 160.95. I biased it to get an impact
 latitude - longitude of 163.75. I wanted to
 change change my impact point 30 degrees to the east,
 and I tried to determine what my P30 burn
 parameters would be to do this, and I got a
 DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> burn of minus 11.6 and a DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> of
 plus 600, DELTA-V<sub>Y</Y> of zero. Now that changed
 my previous DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> burn from minus 50.2. I
 just want to know whether that meets with
 their approval.
04 02 26 15 CC Roger, Jim. We copy and will run it through
 the mill and give you an answer.

04 02 50 05 CDR Roger. Star 02 from one set to two set.
04 02 50 08 CC Roger. Also, set number 2, set number 2,
 change star number 11 to star number 7. Over.
04 02 50 21 CDR Roger. Eleven to 7.
04 02 50 23 CC Roger. Then after star set number 3, initiate
 PTC again; pitch 10, yaw 45. Over.
04 50 36 CDR Pitch 10, yaw 45.
04 02 50 38 CC Roger. Then at 101 hours 30 minutes, delete the
 earth horizon settings. Over.
04 02 50 53 CDR 101:30, delete the earth horizons sightings.
04 02 50 57 CC That's affirmative. The folks here are evaluating
 the thermal situation. Looks like you will be
 out of PTC rather at an extended period of time.
 That's the reason we have you initiating PTC again
 there around 101 as soon as you finish those three
 star sightings. We are still working on the -
 about the next 10 hours after 100 hours. We are
 looking at the thermal situation, and the star
 sighting situation, and we will be giving you more
 updates later on. Over.

Tape 66
Page 2
04 02 51 32 CDR Roger. We don't have a thermal problem at all
 now, do we? All our indications here are normal
 in here.
04 02 51 40 CC Roger. Everything looks okay. I think they're
 just kinda trying to look down the track aways.
04 02 51 47 CDR I'm all for keeping it that way.
04 02 51 50 CC Roger.
04 02 51 53 CDR We deleted them.
04 02 51 55 CC Okay.
04 02 56 53 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 02 56 59 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
04 02 57 00 CC Roger. Frank, I would like to talk to you for a
 minute or two about the AUTO OPTICS funnies that
 you have been seeing throughout the mission. Over.
04 02 57 11 CMP Go ahead.
04 02 57 13 CC Roger. The problems you have run into so far are
 due to some unknown source, probably EMI or the like
 loading your CMC trunnion cell which is now 91, so
 it doesn't really represent your true trunnion angle.
 Now this loading problem we don't feel implies any
 decrease in the reliability in your CMC at all. We
 think that the best way to circumvent the problem
 is to cycle the OPTICS ZERO switch first to OFF and
 then ON prior to using the optics for any purpose.
 And with that procedure, I think you probably won't
 have any more problems. Over.

Tape 66
Page 3
04 02 58 01 CMP Roger, Jerry. Understand. I do notice one difference.
 We did preferred REFSMMAT's. The first
 we had trouble with; the last one worked out as
 expected. I noticed for the first one that when
 the option came up, it was for nominal option,
 whereas for the very same procedure for this last
 REFSMMAT change, we got ... preferred REFSMMAT
 option. ...
04 02 58 27 CC Roger, Jim. Copy.
04 03 00 56 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston with a comeback on
 your entry navigation calculations. Over.
04 03 01 05 CDR Go ahead.
04 03 01 07 CC Roger.  We went through the charts and got exactly
 the same answer as you got.  Looks like your procedure
 is very good; looks like it was real good
 head.  You remembered to average out the velocity.
 We also went ahead and computed the problem to
 verify the chart and got a good solution. Over.
04 03 01 30 CMP Roger.
04 03 01 33 CDR Thank you very much.
04 03 01 35 CC You're welcome.
04 03 01 40 CMP Now if we can get our state vectors to agree,
 we'll be in business.
04 03 01 45 CC No sweat.
04 03 19 38 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 03 19 55 CC Apollo 8, Houston.

Tape 66
Page 4
04 03 19 59 CDR Go ahead.
04 03 20 01 CC Roger, Frank. Is Jim listening?
04 03 20 06 CMP Listening.
04 03 20 08 CC Roger. On your question about the option: PROGRAM
 40 sets the preferred flag such that the
 next P52 will come up option 1, subsequent alignments
 after that come up option 2. Over.
04 03 20 27 CMP Roger. Understand. So 40 will have to come up
 with a TIG burn with an option 1 for us.
04 03 20 34 CC Roger. Now concerning your restart that happened
 in lunar orbit, for the peace of mid of the computer
 people and the MIT folks, we have a question
 Did VERB 34 ENTER to a flashing VERB 51 in
 P22 cause your restart? Over.
04 03 20 56 CMP Yes. That sounds like it was it.
04 03 20 59 CC Roger. Thank you, Jim.
04 03 21 03 CMP That must be a "no, no".
04 03 21 08 CC Yes, Yes. That's a "no, no".
04 03 21 14 CMP That almost caused an unscheduled EVA, too.
04 03 22 29 CC Apollo 8, Houston. BIOMED switch center. Over.
04 03 22 49 CMP Three, two, one -
04 03 22 51 CMP MARK.
04 03 22 52 CC Roger. Your mark.
04 03 50 59 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 03 51 03 CDR Go ahead.

Tape 66
Page 5
04 03 51 06 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. It is about time for
 us to start keeping track of some command module
 RCS temperatures; so when you get a chance, we'd
 like the reading now, and we'll try to repeat it
 about every 8 hours or so.
04 03 51 22 CDR Okay. We'll get them for you right now.
04 03 51 24 CC Roger.
04 03 51 32 CDR You want the motor off the test meter, right?
04 03 51 37 CC That's affirmative.
04 03 51 48 CDR The 5C is pegged high.
04 03 51 55 CC Roger. 5C pegged high.
04 03 51 56 CDR 5D is pegged high.
04 03 51 58 CC Roger. D, high.
04 03 52 00 CDR So's 5D. 6A is high; 6B is high; 6C is 5 volts;
 6D is pegged high.
04 03 52 27 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Understand. 5C and
 5D are pegged high; 6A and 6D are pegged high;
 6 Charlie is 5 volts; and 6 Delta pegged high.
 Over.
04 03 52 42 CDR That's Roger.
04 03 54 56 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 03 55 01 CDR Roger. Go ahead.
04 03 55 03 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're showing quad A running
 a little bit warmer than the other quads. If you
 remember, I mentioned before that we were coming
 into a period of time here where we were going to

Tape 66
Page 6
 spend a lot of time with no PTC going. We'd
 like for you to try to favor quad A if you can
 in the shade, and do whatever you can to keep
 that temperature from getting out of hand. Over.
04 03 55 31 CDR Roger. I'm only reading 121 on quad A.
04 03 55 35 CC Roger.
04 03 55 44 CMP Quad C is the highest temperature we have; it's
 142.
04 03 56 01 CC Roger, Frank. We are more interested in the tank
 temperatures than the quad temperatures. Over.
04 03 56 10 CDR Roger. I understand. Now listen, if you think
 it is that important, we'll just keep PTC-ing it
 and not even do anything.
04 03 56 17 CC Negative. There's no sweat right now. We're
 watching it, and we just wanted to let you know
 that this thing is being looked at. If we get
 anywhere near a situation where we feel we ought
 to change, we'll go back to PTC or cool it.
04 03 56 33 CDR Okay. Thank you. We'll do our best, but it is
 kind of hard, though. You are sort of subject of
 spatial geometry: wherever the stars and the moon
 happens to be, that's where you point.
04 03 56 44 CC Roger. We understand. We're going to keep an
 eye on it down here, and we'll keep you appraised.
04 03 56 52 CDR Thank you.
04 04 03 27 CC Apollo 8, Houston.

Tape 66
Page 7
04 04 03 39 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
04 04 03 41 CC Roger. Pass the word to Jim that on these marks
 that are coming up, pretty important that he remember
 to record his DELTA-R and DELTA-V and trunnion.
 We are working low bit rate down here, and
 so we're not going to be able to record that data
 from here. Over.
04 04 04 02 CDR We are recording them all.
04 04 04 16 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. Did you read that we are recording
 all the DELTA-R and DELTA-V and trunnion ...
04 04 04 21 CC Roger, Frank. Thanks. *

04 04 13 56 CDR Jerry, Apollo 8.
04 04 13 59 CC Roger. Go ahead.
04 04 14 03 CDR As luck would have it, we got the sun almost
 directly ahead on top of us here.
04 04 14 10 CC Roger. We understand, but tank temperature
 is holding steady, so we are all right.
04 04 14 19 CDR Okay.
04 04 30 58 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 04 31 02 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
04 04 31 05 CC Roger, Frank. The helium tank temperature
 that we are watching on quad A has only gone
 up 1 degree in all this work that you are
 doing, so we don't consider it to be too
 terribly serious. What we would like to do,
 as soon as you finish this P23 work, is rather
 than go back into PTC, let's just roll her
 over 180 degrees and put quad A on the cool
 side, and hold it that way until your next
 activity comes up, which is around 102:30.
 Over.
04 04 31 41 CDR Okay. Fine.
04 04 41 47 CDR Okay, Jerry. We're through with PROGRAM 23.
 We're just going to roll here to get the sun
 off quad A, if that's what you want.
04 04 41 55 CC Roger, Frank. Good deal.
04 50 21 CDR It should be getting cool now, Jerry.

Tape 67
Page 2
04 04 50 26 CC Roger, Frank. So far we haven't seen the
 temperature start back down again. We expect
 to see it, though.
04 04 51 25 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
04 04 51 27 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
04 04 51 31 CDR Roger. Give us the word if you want us to
 maneuver back here before that time that you ...,
 please.
04 04 51 38 CC Wilco.
04 04 51 41 CDR Thank you.
04 04 53 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 04 53 52 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
04 04 53 54 CC Roger, Frank. We have some data that was
 missed on your P23. We'd like you to read it
 down to us if you have time.
04 04 54 04 CDR Roger. We will in just a minute.
04 04 54 06 CC Roger.
04 04 54 13 CDR Go ahead. What do you want?
04 04 54 15 CC Roger. On star number 2, the sixth mark, we
 missed DELTA-R and DELTA-V.
04 04 54 25 CDR Sixth mark, that's - did Lovell tell you to
 do this? Come on, Carr; come clean. Did he
 ask you to ask for this?
04 04 54 43 CC Who?
04 04 54 46 CDR Jim Lovell.
04 04 54 48 CC Negative. Uh-uh. We really missed it.
04 04 54 53 CDR It's all zeros, and all zeros.

Tape 67
Page 3
04 04 54 58 CC Roger. All zeros, all zeros. Okay. On star
 number 7, we missed the trunnion on marks 1, 2,
 and 3.
04 04 55 13 CDR On 1, trunnion was 03235; on 2, it was 03240;
 on 3, it was 03241.
04 04 55 31 CC Okay, Frank. And then the last one is on star
 number 1; we missed the trunnion on mark 5.

04 04 55 41 CDR 04064.
04 04 55 46 CC Roger, 04064.
04 04 55 53 CDR Righto.
04 04 55 55 CC Thank you, Frank.
04 04 55 58 CDR You're welcome, Jerry.
04 04 56 03 CC That Lowell's getting pretty proficient.
04 04 56 07 CDR Not bad.
04 04 57 41 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 04 57 46 CDR Go ahead.
04 04 57 47 CC Was that last number you read down to me mark 2
 on star number 1?
04 04 57 59 CDR That's right. Star number 1, mark 7.
04 04 58 03 CC Roger. Thank you. Now that one got you on
 guidance.
04 04 58 16 CDR Okay.
04 05 03 10 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You're back under our
 influence again. Over.
04 05 03 16 CDR Very good. Things start speeding up now, huh?
04 05 03 21 CC Roger. You've been in for about 20 minutes.
04 05 03 26 CDR Very good.

Tape 67
Page 4
04 05 03 29 CMP Jerry, this is Jim.
04 05 03 31 CC Go ahead, Jim.
04 05 03 35 CMP Find out from the Guidance group if a midcourse
 maneuver of minus 4.8 to access corridor at
 14 hours would be better than the 15.2 I came
 up with first.
04 05 03 47 CC Okay. Minus 4.8.
04 05 03 52 CMP Right.
04 05 03 54 CC We have already started checking it, Jim. I
 bet you think you sneaked that P37 past us.
04 05 04 06 CMP Big brother is watching.
04 05 04 09 CC Affirm.
04 05 12 29 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
04 05 12 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
04 05 12 43 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
04 05 12 47 CDR Roger. I just wondered how temp on quad A tank
 is doing.
04 05 12 54 CC We have seen no improvement as yet, Frank.
04 05 13 00 CDR How hot is it?
04 05 13 03 CC Eighty-six degrees.
04 05 13 07 CDR Roger.
04 05 17 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 05 17 32 CDR Go ahead.
04 05 17 34 CC Roger. Frank, we are going to establish a
 range sequence now. We would like to keep
 silence on the net for about 3 minutes. Over.
04 05 17 44 CDR Very veil.

Tape 67
Page 5
04 05 21 21 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Range sequence complete.
 Over.
04 05 21 26 CDR Thank you.
04 05 28 13 CDR Hello, Houston. Apollo 8. How do you read?
04 05 28 16 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear.
04 05 29 11 CDR Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
04 05 29 14 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear by me.
04 05 29 19 CDR I wasn't reading you for a while. I read you
 loud and clear now.
04 05 29 22 CC Roger, Frank.
04 05 29 28 CDR I wanted to know what a range sequence test
 was, Jerry.
04 05 29 35 CC I was afraid you was going to ask that. Stand
 by.
04 05 30 53 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 05 30 57 CDR Go ahead.
04 05 30 59 CC Roger. This range sequence is a phenomenon
 we get on down-voice backup; in this mode,
 the ranging and the voice share the same channels,
 so we have to periodically check and make
 sure that they are not interfering with each
 other. Over.
04 05 31 16 CDR Thank you. These flights are very educational.
04 05 31 28 CC Roger. We are learning a little bit down here,
 too.
04 05 31 38 CDR I hope you're not studying reentry.

Tape 67
Page 6
04 05 31 46 CC No, we're fat on those, Frank.
04 05 31 51 CDR Okay.
04 05 39 12 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 05 39 16 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
04 05 39 18 CC Roger, Frank. We would like for you to go back
 into PTC now. Your helium tank temperature is
 still holding about the same. And we are going
 to try PTC to even things out. Over.
04 05 39 32 CDR Okay.
04 05 40 49 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 05 40 53 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
04 05 40 54 CC Is Jim listening?
04 05 40 58 CDR He's off the air right now.
04 05 41 01 CC Roger, Frank. Let him know that we've compared
 his latest P37, and the state vectors have converged
 to - they are very, very close now.
04 05 41 13 CDR Your state vector and our state vector are
 very, very close.
04 05 41 16 CC That's affirmative, Frank.
04 05 41 18 CDR Is that right, Jerry? Okay. I'll tell him.
 Thank you.
04 05 41 21 CC Roger.
04 05 41 27 CC Don't let his head get big, though.
04 05 41 32 CDR You guys are going to make it impossible to
 live with him. It always was pretty hard.

04 05 51 09 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
04 05 51 13 CDR Hello Michael, we lost lock and Bill hit
 COMMAND RESET to get the lock back on again,
 but you're welcome to the antenna.
04 05 51 21 CC Okay, Frank. Thank you.
04 06 07 02 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
04 06 07 08 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Go ahead.
04 06 07 13 LMP Good morning, Michael.
04 06 07 15 CC Good morning.
04 06 07 17 LMP Or is it afternoon?
04 06 07 23 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You've got a lot of
 background noise and about unreadable. We're
 trying to get a better OMNI.
04 06 07 45 CC Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.
04 06 07 50 LMP Loud and clear.
04 06 07 51 CC Okay. You're loud and clear. Is this Bill?
04 06 07 57 LMP None other.
04 06 07 58 CC I got a message for you while you were asleep.
 Valerie said to tell you that she and the kids
 are leaving for church about 11:30 and eagerly
 awaiting your return. She said presents are
 magically starting to appear under the Christmas
 tree again so it looks like a double barrel
 Christmas. Over.


Tape 68
Page 2
04 06 08 16 LMP You can't beat a deal like that. How was
 Christmas at your house today?
04 06 08 26 CC Early and busy as usual. I told Michael you
 guys are up there, and he said who's driving?
04 06 08 39 LMP That's a good question. I think Isaac Newton
 is doing most of the driving right now.
04 06 08 51 CC Say again.
04 06 08 55 LMP I think Isaac Newton is doing most of the
 driving right now.
04 06 08 59 CC Roger. We copy.
04 06 09 40 LMP Tell Valerie and the kids a Merry Christmas
 for me, Mike, and tell them I'll see them
 there in a while.
04 06 09 46 CC I sure will, and you might tell Frank if
 he's got any messages his people are about
 10 feet away.
04 06 09 57 LMP He said "bah humbug."
04 06 10 01 CDR Howdy, how are you all?
04 06 10 06 CC You've got a whole row of smiling faces in
 the back room, Frank.
04 06 10 11 CDR Very good. Will they be proud of me: I'm
 using the Exer-Genie right now.
04 06 10 19 CC Don't overdo it.
04 06 10 23 CDR I won't.
04 06 15 54 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over,
04 06 15 59 LMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

Tape 68
Page 3
04 06 16 01 CC Roger. Quad Able helium tank temperature has
 dropped very slightly and is looking pretty
 good to us now.
04 06 16 11 LMP Thank you, Michael.
04 06 16 12 CC Righto, and I've got a procedure for Jim I
 would like to read up. It involves bringing
 the LM and the CSM state vectors to the earth's 
 sphere of influence. Over.
04 06 16 27 LMP Alright. Stand by.
04 06 16 29 CC Okay.
04 06 16 34 LMP He's getting his hat on now. Whose procedure
 is this, Michael?
04 06 16 41 CC Oh, it's the summation of the opinions of all
 our experts down here. I got it from
 Mr. Colossus, Gunther Sabionski.
04 06 16 54 LMP Very good. I want to make sure it wasn't
 an Aldrin special.
04 06 17 03 CC I'm sorry you're broken up. Don't say again.
 (Laughter)
04 06 17 16 CMP Merry Christmas, Bud.
04 06 17 25 CC Yes, Merry Christmas up there, Jim. I've
 got a procedure when you are ready to copy.
04 06 17 31 CMP Okay. I just got on my headset; just let
 me get a pencil and paper, and I will copy
 it.
04 06 17 36 CC Okay.

Tape 68
Page 4
04 06 17 58 CMP Okay, Mike.
04 06 18 00 CC Okay. The purpose is to bring the LM and
 the CSM state vectors to earth's sphere of
 influence. Step one: Verb 37 ENTER, 23 ENTER.
 Step two: At NOUN 70, at NOUN 70, load in
 register 1, 2, and 3 the following numbers.
 Register 1, 00002; register 2, five balls;
 register 3, 00210. Step 3: proceed on NOUN 70,
 NOUN 70. Step 4: proceed on NOUN 25, 25.
 Step 5: do not proceed on NOUN 18. Wait
 for 30 seconds; then do VERB 37 ENTER, 00
 ENTER. End of procedure. Over.
04 06 19 29 CMP Okay. As I understand that the reason for
 this procedure is to bring
 the LM and CSM state vectors back to the earth's sphere
 of influence; is that correct?
04 06 19 37 CC That's correct.
04 06 19 42 CMP Okay. To do it we go VERB 37 ENTER, 23 ENTER;
 and at the NOUN 70, we'll load in register 1,
 four balls 2; register 2, all balls; and
 register 3, two balls 210. We'll proceed
 on NOUN 70 and proceed on NOUN 25. We'll
 not proceed on 18. We'll wait 30 seconds,
 and we'll do a VERB 37 ENTER, 00 ENTER.
04 06 20 15 CC That's affirmative. Apollo 8.

Tape 68
Page 5
04 06 20 21 CMP I'm just kinda curious, Mike; I thought this
 was done for us. I thought the computer took
 care of this little problem.
04 06 20 34 CC Roger. Normally, it is done automatically,
 Jim; and had you done the P23's exactly as
 scheduled, it would have been, but there was
 some doubt P23 was stopped about 7 minutes
 prior to the transition point and just to be
 absolutely sure, we included this procedure.
 Over.
04 06 20 59 CMP Okay. Tell Buzz I sure could use his eye-patch.
04 06 21 19 CC Roger. I understand. Buzz had one on Gemini X,
 worked real well.
04 06 21 28 CMP Mike, do you want me to do this procedure now?
04 06 21 31 CC That's affirmative, Jim. Now at your convenience.

04 06 24 10 CC We're set, that's right.
04 06 24 50 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 06 24 54 CMP Go ahead.
04 06 24 56 CC Thank you, Jim. We copied your DSKY work
 there, and it's looking just fine to us now.

 program office - something you might try working
 on right away is - -
04 06 30 00 CC Can you stand by, Apollo 8?
04 06 30 02 CC Apollo 8, can you stand by? We'll try to get
 you a better antenna; you're just about
 unreadable.
04 06 30 10 CDR Alright.
04 06 30 18 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We are right in between
 antennas and if you can wait about 5 minutes
 with your message, we can have better COMM then.
04 06 30 27 CDR Roger.
04 06 33 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 06 33 49 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
04 06 33 51 CC Okay. You're loud and clear now, Frank.
 Go ahead and say what you were saying about
 the program office.
04 06 33 57 CDR They ought to get some moving out on some
 way to fix these windows. The three windows,
 the hatch window and the two side windows,
 really it's a shame, in fact, that they are
 almost totally unusable, because they got so
 gummed up.
04 06 34 17 CC Roger. I sure agree. We copy so far on the
 windows that 2 and 4 are in excellent shape

Tape 68
Page 7
 and 1 and 5 are sort of mediocre and 3 is just
 about totally unusable.
04 06 34 34 CDR Three is totally unusable; 1 and 5 are unusable
 for any kind of photography.
04 06 34 39 CC Roger.
04 06 34 42 CMP And, Mike, that sure puts the CMP in a bad
 light, you know, when you can't see where
 you are going.
04 06 34 48 CC Yes. And when you're setting between two
 guys that won't tell you, too. (Laughter)
04 06 34 54 CMP That's right. You think they will share a
 window? No soap. You might also note the
 optics are very good visibility; so far, no
 coating at all.
04 06 35 04 CC Glad to hear that, Jim.
04 06 42 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 06 42 36 CDR Go ahead.
04 06 42 38 CC Roger. We copy Jim doing a P52, and I'm
 standing by with a maneuver PAD for midcourse
 5 any time at your convenience.
04 06 43 31 CMP Okay. Ready to copy, Mike.
04 06 43 34 CC Roger, Jim. This is midcourse maneuver

Tape 68
Page 9
04 06 50 26 CC Roger. We'd like to dump your waste water
 tank down to 25 percent; we'd like to do it
 before the midcourse, for tracking reasons.
 So if it is convenient with you, if you'll
 start right now, we'll dump on down to 25.
04 06 51 39 CDR Roger. We'll get right with it.
04 06 51 41 CC Thank you.
04 06 55 20 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 06 55 24 CDR Go ahead.
04 06 55 26 CC Roger. We got those loads in and verified;
 you can go back BLOCK at your computer. And
 George Low says he's working on that window
 problem at 6, or spacecraft 104. You just
 happen to have the wrong spacecraft.
04 06 55 40 CDR That's the wrong statement; we've got the
 right spacecraft. I'll clue you, if it keeps
 going this way for 2 more days, we've got not
 only the right spacecraft, but we've got the
 best spacecraft.
04 06 55 50 CC It'll keep going.
04 06 57 13 LMP Apollo 8. We're starting the dump now,
 Houston.
04 06 57 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 06 57 23 LMP Okay. We're starting the waste water dump
 now.

04 06 57 26 CC Okay, Bill. Thank you.
04 06 57 38 LMP That's a blizzard.
04 06 57 42 CC Roger. Understand.
04 06 58 33 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 06 58 39 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
04 06 58 41 CC Roger. I need a Pop Romeo Dog on all three
 and a status report on the LMP.
04 06 59 01 LMP Roger. The LMP's PRD hasn't moved an inch
 since we took off. And that's the one the
 CMP did have, still 0.64. And I just had
 about 5-1/2 hours sleep, and I'm in the
 process of scarfing up a meal; and I've been
 drinking lots of water, feeling good, and
 that's about it.
04 06 59 29 CC okay. And you got a PRD on the other two.
04 06 59 32 LMP Yes. The CMP is ready to report. The CMP
 is reading 1.2 rem.
04 06 59 41 CDR And the CDR: I got stuck with somebody else's,
 but mine reads now - my new one reads
 2.02 rem. I don't know if there is a message
 there or not.
04 06 59 49 LMP He's starting to glow in the dark.
04 06 59 55 CC Yes. You should have hung on to the one you
 had. It sounded a little bit better. I
 copy left to right 2.02, 0.12, and 0.64.
 Over.

04 07 00 10 LMP Roger.
04 07 00 13 CC Thank you, sir.
04 07 00 17 LMP What have they measured in our - what have
 they measured on that, I guess you would call
 it the VABABR, or VABD?
04 07 00 42 CC We're sending the boy to the back room to
 find out.
04 07 00 51 LMP Find out what it is, or what it's reading?
04 07 00 55 CC First one and then the other.
04 07 01 02 LMP We'll need both answers up here, too.
04 07 03 58 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 07 04 02 CMP Go ahead.
04 07 04 04 CC Bill's VA and VR reading that he requested
 is 0.13. Over.
04 07 04 16 LMP Roger. Looks like you've got a little
 discrepancy here.
04 07 04 25 CC Yes, I agree.
04 07 04 39 LMP You ought to give those guys a chance to go
 back to sleep and calibrate those things.
04 07 05 26 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We've just passed 25 percent
 and you can terminate your waste water
 dump, please.
04 07 05 31 LMP Okay. Will do.
04 07 05 41 CDR Believe it or not, our gage is 5 percent
 behind yours.

Tape 66
Page 12
04 07 05 48 CC Yes, John said that he has been noticing that.
04 07 07 23 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 07 07 27 LMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
04 07 07 30 CC Yes. We are going to switch antennas from
 Madrid to Goldstone in about 3 minutes. You
 should hear the glitch.
04 07 07 37 LMP Thank you.
04 07 08 40 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
04 07 08 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 07 08 48 CMP Roger. Just for information, would the
 perigee reading and NOUN 42 be such a big
 minus number for such a small burn. We are
 reading minus 03137 now.
04 07 09 03 CC Roger. Understand; NOUN 42 perigee reads
 minus 03137. Over.
04 07 09 12 CMP Roger. We are going to PROGRAM 30 after you
 give us the target load, and I didn't think
 there would be that much of a change for such a
 small burn.
04 07 09 20 CC Roger. Stand by. We will check into it, Jim.
04 07 16 54 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 07 16 59 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
04 07 17 01 CC Roger, Frank. We don't think there's any
 problem or any funnies in this perigee prediction
 of minus 03137. It's a Keplerian prediction,
 and it's not very accurate. Now we

Tape 68
Page 13
 have taken your vector from the downlink and
 run it through a make-believe external DELTA-V
 maneuver down here, and we get precisely the
 correct answer. Over.
04 07 17 35 CMP Roger. Understand that you figure just
 because of the conics solution that it comes
 up.
04 07 17 40 CC That's affirmative. The Kepler solution is
 just pretty gross.
04 07 17 47 CMP Okay. I was just kind of curious. I could
 see differences when we were talking about
 LOI burns, but this being such a short one,
 I thought it wouldn't be that much difference.
 I understand.
04 07 17 58 CDR Mike, this is Frank.
04 07 18 00 CC Go ahead.
04 07 18 03 CDR You are monitoring and seeing if we get any
 inadvertent engine firing all the time, aren't
 you?
04 07 18 10 CC Well, we can't tell when you're in low bit
 rate. When you're in high bit rate, that's
 right.
04 07 18 20 CDR Okay.if we crank up high bit rate and just
 have you take a checkout look at them?
04 07 18 26 CC Okay.

Tape 68
Page 14
04 07 19 03 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 07 19 08 CDR Go ahead.
04 07 19 10 CC Roger. Since you're on OMNI D (Dog) at this
 time, we're sort of 180 out of phase for the
 high-gain lock antennas. As soon as we can
 get high-gain lock, then we'll - -
END OF TAPE

Tape 69

04 07 19 38 CDR okay. We will take the antennas and get on
 the high gain as soon as we can.
04 07 19 43 CC Thank you.
04 07 26 49 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 07 26 53 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
04 07 26 54 CC Roger, Frank. We've done some more checking,
 and we confirm that that is the correct Keplerian
 prediction on NOUN 42 minus 03137, just like you
 said.
04 07 29 09 CDR Thank you.
04 07 35 41 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 07 35 46 CDR Go ahead.
04 07 35 48 CC Roger. We are going to be doing a ranging
 sequence; if we can eliminate voice for a
 couple of minutes, we would appreciate it.
04 07 35 56 CDR Roger. we will.
04 07 35 58 CC okay.
04 07 42 41 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 07 42 46 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
04 07 42 48 CC Roger. Our ranging is complete, and we have
 been monitoring your thruster firings, and
 they show what appears to be very normal damp
 activities. Over.
04 07 42 59 CDR Thank you. I guess it was associated with the
 water vent.
04 07 43 05 CC Roger. Understand, Frank.

04 07 57 08 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 07 57 12 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
04 07 57 14 CC Frank, we've got about 2-1/2 minutes to ignition,
 and we're still showing some of your SCS
 switches not set up as per checklist; specifically,
 rate LOW, deadband MINIMUM, and your BMAG
 mode at attitude one, rate two.
04 07 57 35 CDR Okay. Thank you.
04 07 57 37 CC And your manual attitude switches in RATE COMMAND.
04 07 57 44 CDR Right.
04 07 58 49 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 07 58 52 CC MARK.
04 07 58 53 CC One minute to ignition. Over.
04 07 58 58 CDR Roger. We concur.
04 07 59 30 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 07 59 32 CC MARK.
04 07 59 34 CC Twenty seconds to ignition.
04 07 59 39 CDR Roger.
04 08 01 33 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
04 08 01 35 CC Go ahead, Jim.
04 08 01 38 CMP Roger. We burned on time, 14 seconds, attitude
 nominal. Our residuals were plus 2 in VG<sub>X</sub>,
 minus 1 in VG<sub>Y</sub> nothing in VG<sub>Z</sub>. Our EMS stopped
 about 6.2 and continued counting after the burn.
04 08 02 03 CC Roger. Understand 14 seconds, burn on time,
 nominal attitude, two-tenths X, one-tenth Y,

Tape 69
Page 3
 and nothing minus one-tenth Y, and nothing Z;
 and you put 6.2 on the EMS, and it continued to
 count after the burn. Is that affirmative?
04 08 02 22 CMP No. We put the burn - we put the burn DELTA-V
 in the EMS, and after the burn, it was still
 counting.
04 08 02 31 CC Roger. Understand.
04 08 02 32 CMP Still counting up.
04 08 02 33 CC Understand.
04 08 03 31 CMP Okay, Houston. We transferred the state vector
 to the LM slot.
04 08 03 36 CC Roger, Jim. Thank you, and I still don't understand
 you on this EMS. Counted down from 5 to
 zero normally and then continued through zero in
 a negative way, and now it's reading minus 6.2?
 Is that affirmative?
04 08 03 52 CMP Roger. That's right. It was counting up when
 we shut it off. Last time I saw it, it was
 6.9. Now Frank just put it on AUTO again with
 the DELTA-V function switch in DELTA-V, and it
 jumped six-tenths. Then he tried the second
 time, and it stayed at zero so we really don't
 know what the story is.
04 08 04 16 CC Roger. Understand you.
04 08 05 48 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8.
04 08 05 51 CC Go ahead, Frank.

Tape 69
Page 4
04 08 05 57 CDR I guess you want us to resume PTC, right?
04 08 06 00 CC Stand by.
04 08 06 29 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 08 06 34 CDR Go ahead.
04 08 06 35 CC We'd like you to resume the PTC attitude,
 pitch 010, yaw 045; and then come out of it
 again for your P23 that you're scheduled for
 about another hour and 10 minutes, in another
 hour and 10 minutes.
04 08 06 55 CDR Roger.
04 08 07 16 CDR Mike, this is Frank. Is this TV still scheduled
for 104:50?
04 08 07 22 CC That's affirmative, Frank, if you can manage it.
04 08 07 27 CDR Okay.
04 08 07 36 CC How's it going with the TV, Frank? Are we - can
 the networks count on having it on schedule?
 Over.
04 08 07 44 CDR Yes, we can have it on schedule. We don't have
 much to do, but we'll perform for you.
04 08 07 49 CC Okay. We have a bunch of filter experts standing
 by if you need any advice.
04 08 07 55 CDR Well, we're just going to have to just do it
 inside today because there are no good shots
 of the moon or the earth; the sun's too darn
 bright.
04 08 08 03 CMP I think it's raining out there.
04 08 08 09 CC Yes, that's what we thought.

Tape 69

04 08 09 57 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
04 08 10 00 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
04 08 10 06 CDR Roger. On this EMS, when I put it in DELTA-V,
 it was reading zero; then I switched to AUTO.
 Sometimes it will count to 19 or 20 feet per
 second.. I guess that is what happened.
04 08 10 17 CC Roger. Understand when you put it to AUTO, it
 maybe will keep counting up to as much as 19 to
 20 feet per second.
04 08 10 27 CDR .Just when you put it to AUTO; it will start
 counting on some occasion, by itself.
04 08 10 31 CC Understand.
04 08 21 26 CDR Mike, we're ready when you are.
04 08 21 28 CC We're ready.
04 08 21 35 CDR Say again.
04 08 21 37 CC Yes, we're ready, Frank. We're all squared
 away and eagerly standing by.
04 08 22 12 CC You got your make-up on?
04 08 22 17 CDR Yes. Have we got a picture?
04 08 22 21 CC Negative, Frank.
04 08 22 43 CDR How about now, Houston?.
04 08 22 46 CC Negative, Frank.
04 08 23 19 CDR We don't seem to have much luck today, but don't
 call for a repairman yet. It may be our camera
 here.
04 08 23 46 CDR Any results yet, Mike?

Tape 69
Page 6
04 08 23 49 CC Negative, Frank. It may be that it hasn't
 warmed up properly.
04 08 23 56 CDR okay. We've had it on for a while. Are you
 getting our FM okay?
04 08 24 04 CC Okay, Frank. There, we got it. It's coming in
 loud and clear. We look like we're looking at
 your hat and now the MDC.
04 08 24 18 CDR Okay. Well, good afternoon. This is the
 Apollo 8 crew. And how is it focusing now,
 Houston?
04 08 24 27 CC It's looking good. If you can hold the thing
 still, there's sort of a time delay. Any
 motion at all there ruins our picture.
04 08 24 39 CDR Tell me if there is any difference in it now.
04 08 24 42 CC It's looking good now.
04 08 24 46 CDR Okay, fine.
04 08 24 48 CC It looks like you're okay, but somebody else is
 upside down.
04 08 24 54 CDR Okay. That's right. That's Jim Lovell. What
 we thought we'd do today was just show you a
 little bit about life inside Apollo 8. We've
 shown you the scenes of the moon, the scenes
 of the earth, and we thought we'd invite you
 into our home. It's been our home at least for
 4 days as you can see on the instrument panel.
 We mark off each day on the instrument panel.

Tape 69
Page 7
 We're four down, and we're working on the
 fifth day. Of course, we're all looking forward
 to the landing on Friday. Down here in the part
 of the spacecraft that we call the lower equipment
 bay, we have the President's adviser on
 physical fitness, Captain Jim Lovell, about to
 undergo an exercise program that we do every
 day. You notice that he floats around very
 freely. He just bumped his head on the optics,
 used for our navigating. He's working with an
 exercise device that's designed to keep the
 muscles in shape. Now another very important
 function of our spacecraft is the computer,
 and I thought you might be interested in seeing
 what we have here, the displays that give us
 all the information about our burn, about navigating,
 gating, and about the velocity that we use
 during entry and retrofire on earth-orbital
 missions. You can see it's controlled by a
 DSKY, or similar to a typewriter keyboard,
 and the things that go in and out of that are
 absolutely miraculous. It's done a fantastic
 job for us, and Jim Lovell has done an excellent
 job operating it. Now another very important
 thing whether you're in space or the ground is
 eating, and I've asked Bill Anders to show you

Tape 69
Page 8
 how we eat up here in the flight. Pardon the
 picture while we move around here and change
 cameras. The food that we use is all dehydrated;
 it comes prepackaged in vacuum-sealed bags. You
 notice that all Bill has to do to keep it in one
 place is let go of it. Except for the air currents
 in the spacecraft, it would stay perfectly
 still. He gets out his handy, dandy scissors
 and cuts the bag. The food is varied, generally
 pretty good. If that doesn't sound like a rousing
 endorsement, it isn't, but nevertheless, it's
 pretty good food. You can see that Bill is very
 clever. He does things swiftly. Actually, those
 food bags are stuck together because they've been
 vacuum packed in plastic.
04 08 28 24 CMP What do you have today, Bill, for dinner?
04 08 28 32 LMP Well, here we have some cocoa; should be good.
 I'll be adding about 5 ounces of hot water to
 that. These are little sugar cookies, some
 orange juice, corn chowder, chicken and gravy,
 and a little napkin to wipe your hands when
 you're done. I'll prepare some orange juice
 here.
04 08 29 37 CDR Okay. You can see that he's taking his scissors
 and cutting the plastic end off a little nozzle
 that he's going to insert the water gun into.

Tape 69
Page 9
 The water gun dispenses a half-ounce burst of
 water per click. Here we go; Bill has it in
 now, and the water is going in. I hope that
 you all had better Christmas dinners today than
 us, but nevertheless, we thought you might be
 interested in how we eat.
04 08 30 51 CC Roger. I haven't heard any complaints down
 here, Frank. We'll bring you up to speed on
 your food when you get back.
04 08 30 59 CDR Very good.
04 08 31 01 CC Looks like a happy home you've got up there.
04 08 31 04 CDR Ordinarily, we let these drinks settle for
 5 or 10 minutes, but Bill's going to drink it
 right now. Then, to get on with the program,
 he cuts open another flap, and you'll see a
 little tube comes out - -
04 08 31 22 CMP This is not a commercial.
04 08 31 36 CDR - - and he drinks his delicious orange drink.
 Maybe I should say he drinks his orange drink.
 He's usually not that fast. Bill is really in
 a hurry today. Well, that's what we eat. Now
 another very important part of the spacecraft
 is the navigation station or the optics panel.
 And we - just a minute; Bill wants to say something.
04 08 32 04 LMP That's good; but not quite as good as good old
 California orange juice.

Tape 69
Page 10
04 08 32 09 CDR Bill's from Florida.
04 08 32 12 CDR Okay. Now if you'll let me have the camera,
 Jim, I'll show the people where you do most of
 your work. Okay. Bill, can you explain it?
04 08 32 25 CMP If I can clean up some of Bill's food around
 here, and have it away - Down in this area is
 called the LEB or the lower equipment bay,
 and we have our optics positioning equipment
 right here. We do all our navigation down here
 by sighting on stars and on horizons of either
 the moon or the earth. And this is where we
 find out exactly where we are in space, what
 direction, and how fast we are traveling. And
 our computer, as Frank has mentioned, takes
 information and tells us how to maneuver to
 get home safely. I work with the scanning
 telescope and the sextant, and occasionally, if
 I get too busy, I just sort of float out of sight
 and go up into the tunnel which is the tunnel to
 the hatch of the lunar module which we don't
 have onboard, of course.
04 08 33 35 CDR Now that's about all we have for today. I -
 each and every one of us wish each and every
 one of you a very Merry Christmas. And, I
 guess we'll see you tomorrow, and we'll be
 landing early Friday morning. Merry Christmas
 from Apollo 8.

 CC Roger. Merry Christmas from the ground, Apollo 8,
 and thank you very much for the guided tour. We
 really enjoyed it.
04 08 34 00 CDR Roger.
04 08 35 11 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 08 35 15 CDR Go ahead, Mike.
04 08 35 16 CC We're suggesting attitude deadband MAX and rate
 HIGH.
04 08 35 25 CDR You're right, Thank you.
04 08 45 29 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
04 08 45 32 CC Go ahead, Frank.
04 08 45 36 CDR How soon will they tell us what effect
 midcourse had on our trajectory, Mike?
04 08 45 42 CC Oh, the longer we track, the smarter we'll get;
 but stand by one for a pertinent answer.
04 08 46 39 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 08 46 43 CDR Go ahead.
04 08 46 44 CC Tentatively, midcourse correction at 122 hours
 is zero; and in about an hour and a half, we'll
 have some track data to confirm that.
04 08 46 57 CDR Okay. Thank you.
04 08 47 09 CDR We're going to have something to eat here, Mike;
 just taking it easy.
04 08 47 16 CC Roger. Understand, Frank.
04 08 47 39 CDR Did you get another shotgun for Christmas?
04 08 47 45 CC No, I'm missing enough with the one I have.

Tape 69

04 08 47 50 CDR That's what Edwin told me; I thought maybe you
 might want to try another one.
04 08 48 00 CDR What was it, 40 shots at four birds?
04 08 48 02 CC Oh, negative, Frank. I'm 100 percent, one bird
 per box.
04 08 48 12 CDR Then you and I are in the same fix.
04 08 51 18 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
04 08 51 22 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
04 08 51 26 CMP It appears that we did a grave injustice to
 the food people. Just after our TV show,
 Santa Claus brought us a TV dinner each, which
 was delicious, turkey and gravy, cranberry
 sauce, grape punch; outstanding.
04 08 51 45 CC Roger, Jim. Glad to hear it. Now we're down
 a here eating cold coffee and bologna sandwiches.

04 09 10 23 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
04 09 10 28 CDR Roger. We've got an awful lot of these stars
 to mark on now, Mike, and they were having some
 concern about the PTC. Will you let us know if
 we stay in one position too long, or if we have
 to knock off and do some PTC?
04 09 10 42 CC Will do, Frank.
04 09 10 45 CDR Thank you.
04 09 12 46 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We are monitoring your
 temperatures. The quads all look good. We
 will continue to do so, and we expect no difficulty
 with them during the P23 work.

04 09 49 20 CC Roger, Bill. We would like to talk about your
 high-gain antenna sometime when you get a minute.
04 09 49 27 LMP Okay. Just a second, Mike.
04 09 50 47 LMP About 5 minutes, Mike, we'll be done here.
04 09 56 22 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. About the high-gain antenna.

Tape 70
Page 2
04 09 56 26 CC Okay, Bill. We think it would be an extremely
 worthwhile thing to find out how it operates
 in the AUTO REACQ mode, and we propose running
 a test on it in that mode from 109 to 111 hours
 GET. Over.
04 09 56 46 LMP Okay. We'll do that.
04 09 56 48 CC Okay. I have about a - -
04 09 56 50 LMP We'll try it on the way out.
04 09 56 58 CC We have a detailed procedure which we can read
 up to you anytime you're ready.
04 09 57 07 LMP Go ahead.
04 09 57 10 CC Okay. We suggest the start time 109 hours GET,
 stop time 111 hours, and you'll be in a PTC.
 We're requesting a left roll rate, which we
 notice that you've been preferring, a left
 roll rate of 1 revolution per hour, and this
 is in your present PTC attitude (i.e., pitch
 10 degrees, 010 degrees, and yaw 45 degrees).
 The procedure is this: step 1, stop at roll
 angle 150 degrees; acquire - this is step 2 -
 acquire in MANUAL mode; three, switch to AUTO
 NARROW BEAM; four, make sure tracking in AUTO
 mode then switch to AUTO REACQ mode; five, position
 the high-gain antenna - -
04 09 58 17 CMP Wait a minute, Houston.
04 09 58 19 CMP Whoa, whoa, whoa.
04 09 58 21 CC Okay. Whoa, whoa. Standing by.

Tape 70
Page 3
04 09 58 23 LMP I'm still starting.
04 09 58 30 LMP Okay. Make sure tracking in AUTO and then what?
04 09 58 34 CC Make sure tracking in AUTO, and then switch to
 AUTO REACQ mode. Over.
04 09 58 46 LMP Okay. Will do.
04 09 58 48 CC Okay. Step 5, position high-gain antenna
 pitch and yaw control to predicted earth's
 rise angles, and those angles are yaw 50 degrees,
 pitch minus 40 degrees. Over.
04 09 59 18 LMP Okay.
04 09 59 19 CC Okay. Two more steps. Step 6, remain on high-gain
 antenna in this mode for two REV's. Do not
 switch to OMNI anytime during these two REV's,
 and maintain mode configuration of voice and
 data. We expect loss of track should be no
 more than 15 minutes per REV. Over.
04 09 59 51 LMP Roger.
04 09 59 53 CC And the final step, 7, if any problem arises,
 go back to your initial gimbal angles of
 10 degrees pitch, 45 degrees yaw, and 150 degrees
 roll; reacquire and go to AUTO mode. Over.
04 10 00 18 LMP Yes, I guess there ought to be a step 4A which
 says start roll again, right?
04 10 00 23 CC That's affirmative. Excuse me there, that's
 affirmative.
04 10 00 38 LMP
 Okay. If - let's see, if we - I don't understand
 your last comment. If we get into a

Tape 70
Page 4
 problem, you want us to go back to 150 degrees
 roll?
04 10 00 50 CC Well, all we want you to do is go ahead and
 reacquire in the AUTO mode, Bill. And it looks
 like that would be one way of doing it. But all
 we're saying is, you know, if you want to talk
 to us about something, or you have my other
 problems, or you don't like the way it looks,
 anything at all, just go ahead and reacquire
 in the AUTO mode.
04 10 01 10 LMP Yes, why don't we just say if we do have problems,
 it doesn't pick it up when it's supposed
 to, give it a good try, and then call you up
 on the OMNI's or position ourselves and we'll
 talk about it and try for another two REV's,.
04 10 01 21 CC That's just fine, Bill.
04 10 01 29 LMP Okay. It's worked. We tried it once or twice
 on the way out, but the one modification is
 once it did break lock, and go to its MANUAL
 position, but I switched to the OMNI's in
 between. That sounds fine.
04 10 01 45 CC Bill, could you run through that again? We're
 not reading you too loud, and would you say
 again what you tried on the way out, please.
04 10 01 55 LMP On the way out, they gave us some REACQ angles
 which we used, and once it broke lock and re-positioned
 itself, why, it went over to the OMNI's

Tape 70
Page 5
 and waited till we got to near breaking lock
 again and switched back and snapped right in
 there.
04 10 02 20 CC Roger. Thank you. We copy.
04 10 02 28 LMP We have a few more stars to get, and then we'll
 give it a try.
04 10 02 33 CC Roger.
04 10 23 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 10 23 20 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
04 10 23 22 CC Roger, Bill. We got a bunch of tapes of some
 of your favorite music down here. You be
 interested in hearing a little background on the
 S-band?
04 10 23 32 LMP Go ahead.
04 10 23 35 CC Okay.

04 10 27 24 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
04 10 27 28 CMP Roger. For some reason, we suddenly got a
 PROGRAM 01 and no attitude light on our computer.
04 10 27 35 CC We confirm that.

 we'd like to know did you select 01,
 and you get a VERB 37 ENTER, 01 ENTER?
04 10 30 15 CMP Let's see, I'm not too sure, Mike. I might
 have done that, yes.
04 10 30 20 CC okay.
04 10 30 21 CMP We have star 01 coming up, now that might have
 been the reason.
04 10 30 25 CC Okay. We understand. Why don't you just hold
 what you've got on your DSKY, and we'll be with
 you shortly.
04 10 30 29 CMP okay.
04 10 32 29 CC Apollo 8, Houston.

04 10 37 56 CDR GO ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
04 10 37 58 CC okay. Frank, our procedure is to select P00,
 and from P00 go to P51, and get a platform
 alignment. After you've done that, we will
 send you up a P27, a REFSMMAT, and then you
 can do P52 REFSMMAT options. Then you'll be
 back in business. Over.

04 10 48 29 CDR Okay. We've completed a P51 now. You want
 us to try a P52, or you want us to wait
 till we can put a REFSMMAT in?
04 10 48 39 CC Stand by one, will you, please, Frank?
04 10 48 43 CDR Roger.
04 10 48 50 CC We're putting together a P27 load for you now,
 Frank; that's the reason for the delay. We
 just want to make sure we don't overlook anything
 before we send it up to you.
04 10 49 02 CDR Okay. We'll just sit tight then. We've got
 a good P51. We'll just wait till you put in
 a REFSMMAT, and then, of course, we'll fine
 align over to that, right?
04 10 49 14 CC That's right, that's exactly right. Just stand
 by 
04 10 49 45 CDR Mike, this is Frank again.
04 10 49 47 CC Go ahead.
04 10 49 50 CDR I suggest that we go ahead while you're doing
 that, do a P52 here; and let it do an automatic
 and just tweak this up. Jim had to use Rigel

Tape 71
Page 30

 and Sirius, and they're pretty close together.
 And although we got a zero difference for the
 star angle, that might not be a bad idea just
 to try a 52 here.
04 10 50 08 CC We'd rather not do that, Frank. Stand by one.
04 10 50 14 CDR Alright. We won't do a thing.
04 10 50 47 CC Frank, we feel that procedure that you're talking
 about is really not required, and it's sort
 of wasting your time. You'd still have to - 
 upon completion of that, we'd have to send you
 a new REFSMMAT, and you'd have to go ahead and
 do P52 to that REFSMMAT in addition. Over.
04 10 51 07 CDR We understand that. Go ahead. We'll wait for
 your REFSMMAT.
04 10 51 09 CC Okay. Thank you.
04 10 52 11 CC Apollo 8, Houston. If you'd go P00 and ACCEPT,
 we have our P27 ready. We'll send you up a
 REFSMMAT. Over.
04 10 52 20 CDR Roger. P00 and ACCEPT.
04 10 52 23 CC Roger.
04 10 53 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Frank, we'd like to make
 sure you understand that when you do your P52,
 you want to select option 1, the preferred
 option, because those are the registers we're
 blinking now with this P27.
04 10 53 31 CDR Roger. Option 1; thank you.

Tape 71

04 10 55 08 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We got a good load in; it's
 your computer. Go to BLOCK.
04 10 55 16 CMP Okay.
04 10 55 17 CDR Roger. stand by.
04 10 55 19 CC And you can go ahead with your P52 at your convenience.
04 10 55 24 CDR We're going ahead right now.
04 10 58 47 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 10 58 49 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
04 10 58 50 CC Roger. When Jim gets to the end of P52, he's
 got a flashing VERB 37. We'd like him to not
 proceed, to hold at that point; we'd like to
 read some bits and pieces out of the computer
 at that time. Over.
04 10 59 10 CDR Roger.
04 10 59 20 CC Apollo 8, if Anders has got time to give us a
 countdown, could we get the BIOMED switch from
 center to left?
04 10 59 33 LMP Two, one -
04 10 59 34 LMP MARK.
04 10 59 38 CC Did you take that 1.7-second time delay into
 account?
04 10 59 44 LMP Sorry about that.
04 11 00 38 CMP Okay. Houston, you have it.
04 11 00 49 CC Thank you, Jim. And I'll give you at estimate
 here on how long we want to hold at this point;
 it won't be too much longer.

Tape 71
Page 5
04 11 00 58 CMP Roger. It was my goof: I must have put in
 3701 instead of 3723 and 501.
04 11 01 11 CC Roger.
04 11 03 04 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We have got a flight plan
 suggestion for you.
04 11 03 11 CDR Go ahead.
04 11 03 13 CC Go ahead and delete the remainder of the P23's
 that you're working on now, go back to PTC attitude,
 and then pick up where it says 108 hours
 in the flight plan to pick up again there with
 your P23, or if you prefer to slip that time
 a couple of hours, if you want to get some
 rest in between.
04 11 03 37 CDR I think that's a good idea; we'll do that.
04 11 03 40 CC Okay.
04 11 03 59 CMP Mike, what does this do to our state vector?
04 11 04 02 CC Not a thing. We've looked at your state vector,
 and it's good.
04 11 04 08 CMP So we didn't lose all the NAV we had just accomplished,
 right?
04 11 04 16 CC Stand by one on that, Jim. I don't know; I'm
 checking.
04 11 05 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 11 05 49 CMP Go ahead.
04 11 05 51 CC Roger. I say again, your state vector is just
 fine; it's still ticky-poo, and the reason we're

Tape 71
Page 6
 holding here is that we're checking to see if
 any P23 information was lost. That's reason one,
 and the second reason is that your W-matrix shares
 some computer memory cells with P01, and we are
 getting a clarification on the status of your
 W-matrix before we proceed. Over.
04 11 06 22 CMP Roger, Michael.
04 11 06 53 CDR We'll go ahead and start heading over to the
 PTC attitude.
04 11 06 57 CC Very good.
04 11 07 57 CDR Do you need that high gain any more, Mike?
04 11 08 07 CC Negative. We don't need it any more.
04 11 18 51 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 11 18 56 CC Roger, Frank. We're coming up on time for an
 oxygen purge on all three fuel cells. It
 might be a good time to do it while we are
 waiting here.
04 11 19 04 CDR Fine.
04 11 19 31 CDR Alright. Mike, we are going to purge the
 three fuel cells, oxygen only.
04 11 19 35 CC That's correct. Thank you.
04 11 23 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston. That's enough on fuel
 cell number 1; if you'd start on two please.
04 11 23 51 CDR Roger.

Tape 71
Page 7
04 11 32 22 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're in low bit rate now.
 Last time we saw you, you were still purging.
 Over.
04 11 32 31 CMP Roger. ...
04 11 32 35 CC You're unreadable, but request that you end
 your purge.
04 11 32 42 CMP Roger. We ended our purge.
04 11 32 45 CC Thank you.
04 11 38 37 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 11 38 42 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
04 11 38 44 CC Roger, Jim. I've got a short procedure I would
 like to read up to you on your DSKY, and I'd
 like to explain what it is. Your W-matrix
 shared some memory locations with P01; therefore,
 the W-matrix that you have right now is
 not a good one, and we would not want you to
 continue your P23 sightings with that matrix.
 So the procedure I'm going to give you is
 going to cause the matrix to reinitialize itself
 prior to your next P23, when you go into P23.
 And this will put you back with the value of the
 W-matrix which you loaded after TEI, you remember,
 that 3303 thing. And if this has any further
 effects on the flight plan, we're in the process
 of sorting that out, and if need be, we'll send
 you up a revised sighting schedule later, both
 with the COMM and loss of COMM case. Over.

Tape 71
Page 8
04 11 39 53 CMP Okay. Stand by, and I'll get something to
 copy with.
04 11 39 57 CC Okay.
04 11 40 09 CMP Okay. Go ahead.
04 11 40 11 CC Okay. Insert without releasing the flashing
 VERB 37 the following: VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER,
 77 ENTER, 40 ENTER, ENTER, VERB 37 ENTER,
 00 ENTER. Over.
04 11 40 49 CMP Understand. We insert VERB 37 without releasing,
 is that correct?
04 11 40 56 CC Roger. You should have flashing 37 on your DSKY
 now, and without releasing that flashing 37, go
 ahead with the VERB 25, et cetera.
04 11 41 08 CMP Roger. Okay. I see what you mean. Okay. We'll
 insert VERB 25, NOUN 07 ENTER, 77 ENTER, 40 ENTER,
 ENTER, reinsert VERB 37 ENTER, 00 ENTER.
04 11 41 24 CC That's all correct. Say, if you've got any
 questions about that, we would be happy to
 answer them.
04 11 41 35 CMP Roger. Are we cleared to do that now?
04 11 41 37 CC That's affirmative, Jim.
04 11 41 39 CMP Roger.
04 11 42 29 CDR Hey, Mike, this is Frank.
04 11 42 32 CC Go ahead, Frank.
04 11 42 36 CDR Is there any danger that this might have screwed
 up any other part of memory that would be involved
 with entry or anything like that?

Tape 71
Page 9
04 11 42 53 CC Frank, all indications are that there is
 absolutely no problem with anything in the
 computer memory other than the W-matrix. However,
 we are continuing to look at it, and if
 there is any doubt in our mind, we will ask you
 to dump the memory locations for us later. Over.
04 11 43 15 CDR Okay. Fine.
04 11 56 41 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 11 56 45 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
04 11 56 47 CC Roger, Jim. We thought you might be interested
 in knowing, based on 2-1/2 hours worth of track
 after your last midcourse, and looking ahead,
 we're predicting the midcourse correction at
 122 hours will be less than 1 foot per second.
 And keep it on going to entry interface minus
 2 hours, we're predicting 2 foot per second
 midcourse at that time. Now those numbers will
 be refined; we'll get about another 8 hours of
 track on you before we amend them. Over.
04 11 57 21 CMP Sounds like we're on pretty good trajectory.
04 11 57 25 CC Can't hardly beat it.
04 11 57 33 CMP After we do these next P23's, I'll see what our
 P37 gives us. What's that midcourse, 122 hours
 that has practically zero?
04 11 57 44 CC Yes. It's looking to be less than 1 foot per
 second, about four-tenths of a foot per second

Tape 71
Page 10
 right now. And then the one before entry, at
 2 hours before entry interface, is looking to
 be about 2 feet per second.
04 11 58 00 CMP Roger. Well, okay. I'll run a P37, and we
 can just compare the difference.

04 12 08 53 LMP Roger. Got the JOD back on watch again. We
 want to make sure we don't overdo the star sightings
 at the expense of thermal control, so you
 might keep an eye on us and give us a NO-GO if
 we start getting too hot on one side.
04 12 09 09 CC Roger. Will do, Bill. Has Jim gone to bed?
04 12 09 18 CMP No, I'm right here. We're going to start doing
 cislunar NAV right now, and Bill's up in the
 left-hand seat.
04 12 09 28 CC Roger. Understand; you're going to do some P23's
 now. We thought you were going to take a rest
 and do them later.
04 12 09 38 CMP No, Frank is asleep now. We'll get these out
 of the way. So I'm coming over to do a trunnion
 alignment at this time, and then we'll go into
 the P23.
04 12 09 56 CC Okay, Jim. There's one thing before you get
 started on the P23. What we told you before,
 we still think is absolutely correct. The only
 thing in the computer memory that is changed by
 that P02 is the W-matrix. However, as an additional
 precaution, we'd like to dump the computer
 memory and go through it and check it bit

Tape 72
Page 2
 by bit and make sure everything is exactly
 copacetic. Over.
04 12 10 31 LMP okay. Do you want to do that now?
04 12 10 34 CC Affirmative. We're getting Goldstone configured
 for it; it'll be just a minute. And while we're
 doing that, I can read you this procedure if
 you're ready to copy.
04 12 10 43 CMP Okay. Stand by one, and I'll be ready to copy
 pretty soon.
04 12 10 47 CC Thank you.
04 12 11 01 CMP Go ahead.
04 12 11 03 CC Okay. We'd like a VERB 01 NOUN 01 ENTER, 333
 ENTER, and then we'd like for you to read us
 register 1. Register 1 we expect will be a
 10 000, and if register 1 is equal to that, then
 what that means is that the computer will dump
 its erasable memory twice. That's 10 000 numbers,
 twice number for the erasable memory dump. If
 it's not reading 10 000, then we'll ask you to
 make it read 10 000 by going VERB 21 NOUN 01
 ENTER, 333 ENTER, 10 000 ENTER. After you've
 done that, the dump VERB is VERB 74 ENTER, and
 that will automatically dump the total erasable
 memory twice, and return you to the proper configuration.
04 12 12 13 CMP okay. The procedure will be VERB 01 NOUN 01
 ENTER, 333 ENTER, and read out register 1. Then

Tape 72
Page 3
 10 000 - the memory - the computer will then dump
 the memory twice as properly configured. If not,
 we have to load in 10 000, and we do that by going
 VERB 21 NOUN 01 ENTER, 333 ENTER, 10 000 ENTER,
 and VERB 74 ENTER. Now if register 1 does read
 10 000, then we'll still have to do the VERB 74
 ENTER, is that correct?
04 12 12 49 CC That's affirmative. That VERB 74 ENTER is what
 starts the dump. Then we just prior to that want
 to make sure we got 10 000; we made sure. And just
 hang loose one on Goldstone down here; we're getting
 it configured.
04 12 13 10 CMP Roger. You need the high gain, Mike?
04 12 13 13 CC Negative. We won't need the high gain.
04 12 15 21 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Goldstone is all ready, and
 you can go ahead with that procedure, Jim.
04 12 15 28 CMP Roger.
04 12 15 55 CMP Okay. Register 1 reads 10 000.
04 12 15 58 CC Okay. Thank you.
04 12 16 07 CMP And do you want VERB 74 now?
04 12 16 09 CC That's fine.
04 12 17 59 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 12 18 03 CMP Go ahead.
04 12 18 04 CC Roger. Have you done the VERB 74 ENTER yet?
04 12 18 07 CMP No, I'm waiting for your command.
04 12 18 10 CC Okay. I'm sorry; you must have missed it. You
can go ahead right now, Jim; we're all set.

Tape 72
Page 4
04 12 18 17 CMP Roger. VERB 74.
04 12 18 23 CMP On its way down.
04 12 18 25 CC Thank you.
04 12 20 18 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Jim, the dump is complete.
 You can go ahead and do whatever you like with
 your computer now.
04 12 20 26 CMP Roger.
04 12 20 34 LMP We're going to be restricted to P23 for a while.
04 12 20 38 CC Just don't let Anders touch the computer.
04 12 20 45 LMP I haven't yet, and I don't plan to.
04 12 20 50 CC Roger. We concur with that decision.
04 12 22 17 CC Oh, we've just been honored by the presence of
 Mr. Neil Armstrong who is now standing by the
 CAP COM console, alert and eager.
04 12 22 28 CMP Roger. Ask him how the stock market is doing.
04 12 22 31 CC Tears are rolling down his face.
04 12 26 25 CC Apollo 8, Houston..
04 12 26 29 LMP Go ahead.
04 12 26 31 CC With the computer, we sort of got behind in our
 promise of music. Do you still want it?
04 12 26 38 LMP Go ahead.
04 12 26 41 CC Okay.
04 12 26 44 LMP Just so Neil doesn't accompany it.
04 12 27 00 CC ... choir.
04 12 27 09 CC Neil says you're in luck; he has a cold today.
04 12 29 18 (Music 
 of "Joy to the World" and a choir singing
 another song)

Tape 72
Page 5
04 12 32 09 LMP Must be the wrong speed.
04 12 33 01 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
04 12 33 21 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 12 33 25 LMP Roger, Mike. That's real nice, but if you don't
 mind, you'd better hold it off until we get this
 tracking test done. ...
04 12 33 45 CC Roger, Bill. We concur.
04 12 33 54 LMP Sounds like it is being run at the wrong speed.
04 12 33 58 CC It doesn't sound very good to us either.
04 12 34 02 LMP Coming through nicely, though, Mike. You're
 coming through nicely, Mike; maybe you could
 just sing a little bit.
04 12 34 10 CC Yes, I'll get my harmonica.
04 12 56 36 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
04 12 56 39 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
04 12 56 42 LMP Roger, Mike. How are our temperatures looking
 across the service module? Could it be GO here
 for a shoot in another couple sets on this next
 start?
04 12 56 53 CC Yes. I'm monitoring them, and they look real
 good to me, Bill. Just a second and I will check
 with the experts. Yes, you are just fine, Bill,
 on your quad temps.
04 12 57 08 LMP And SPS is okay?
04 12 57 13 CC Affirmative.  SPS is looking good also.
04 12 57 19 LMP Okay.

Tape 72
Page 6
04 12 57 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 12 57 32 LMP Go ahead, Mike.
04 12 57 34 CC Roger, Bill. Because of this W-matrix thing,
 we would like to add some more star sightings
 when Jim gets through with the series that he
 is currently on. And I have the information
 relevant to them when you are ready to copy.
04 12 57 53 LMP Stand by.
04 12 58 00 LMP Go ahead.
04 12 58 02 CC Okay. This is - we would like him to do them,
 as I say, whenever he is through the series he
 is on now, and they are the same ones that are
 printed on your flight plan page 2-86. The
 first one we'd like to increase to two sets;
 the second one we'd like to increase to two
 sets, making a total of five sets on those stars
 on page 2-86. Do you copy?
04 12 58 34 LMP Roger.
04 12 58 44 CC Okay. The other change is on an elapsed time
 of 120 - a hundred and twenty hours: we'd like
 to increase that P23 work, the first star change,
 from one set to two sets. The second star from
 one to two - -
04 12 59 07 LMP Wait a minute, wait a minute.
04 12 59 08 CC Okay.
04 12 59 12 LMP Okay. Looking for the page; I got it now.

Tape 72
Page 7
04 12 59 16 CC okay. The first star, make two sets; second
 star, two sets; for a total of five sets.
04 12 59 25 LMP Okay.
04 12 59 27 CC And if you're in a copying mood, I have - would
 you believe - a couple of changes to your entry
 checklist which I'd like to read up to you
 sometime today or tomorrow.
04 12 59 43 LMP okay. Why don't we get them here after this
 one set of stars.
04 12 59 46 CC Very good.
04 13 00 01 CC Roger, Bill. I was just given a new one here.
 While you've got your flight plan out, this
 would be 130 hours GET. Have you got that page?
04 13 00 15 LMP I just put it away, but I'll get it out again.
04 13 00 17 CC I'm sorry about that.
04 13 00 24 LMP ... if you want me.
04 13 00 33 CC Roger. At 130 hours GET, star 02: Where it is
 printed two sets, we'd like to make that only
 one set; and then we would like to add star 11
 (star one - one) lunar far horizon, two sets.
 Over.
04 13 01 05 LMP okay.
04 13 01 08 CMP Hey, Mike. Is MIT slipping in the back door?
04 13 01 14 CC Not really, Jim. It has to do with this W-matrix.
 You remember that we reinitialized it in lunar
 orbit, and then we worked on it as you came back

Tape 72
Page 8
 on the previous sightings you made, and now
 we've gone and reinitialized it again at this
 point. And we'd like to restore it to its
 former size and shape and whatnot.
04 13 01 40 CMP Okay. I understand.
04 13 12 12 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
04 13 12 15 CC Go ahead, Jim.
04 13 12 20 CMP Mike, I have got the entry checklist right now.
 You want to give me an update?
04 13 12 24 CC Okay, Bill. Thank you. The first one is on
 page E-7.
04 13 12 32 LMP Okay. Stand by.
04 13 13 08 LMP Okay, Mike. Ready to go. Now I know why Neil
 was over there.
04 13 13 14 CC No. You can't blame it on him. Page E-7 under
 CM RCS preheat, halfway down where it says "UP
 TELEMETRY BLOCK" - Are you with me?
04 13 13 31 LMP I am with you.
04 13 13 33 CC Okay. After UP TELEMETRY BLOCK, insert "RCS
 CM heaters circuit breakers to CLOSE."
04 13 13 58 LMP Okay.
04 13 14 00 CC All they are doing there is just making sure
 you get your heater circuit breakers closed.
 The next one is on page E-9.
04 13 14 25 LMP Ready to copy.
04 13 14 27 CC Roger. On E-9 up near the top under "terminate
 CM RCS preheat" and the middle there, after

Tape 72
Page 9
 "CM RCS heaters OFF, LMP confirm," insert "RCS
 CM heaters circuit breakers to OPEN." That's
 just opening those two breakers back up.
04 13 14 54 LMP Roger.
04 13 14 56 CC And the last change is on page 14.
04 13 15 20 LMP Okay.
04 13 15 22 CC Yes. This one should be a favorite of yours.
 Near the top where it says "tape recorder,
 RECORD FORWARD"- Are you with me?
04 13 15 35 LMP Roger.
04 13 15 36 CC Insert between "tape recorder" and "RECORD
 FORWARD," insert "COMMAND RESET high bit rate."
 Over.
04 13 16 08 LMP Okay. We got them.
04 13 16 10 CC Thank you, Bill. That's all.
04 13 16 14 LMP Okay, Michael.
04 13 16 24 CC How is it going? Do you want any systems dope?
04 13 16 29 LMP Yes, they are hanging together. I haven't even
 looked at them for the last half hour. I have
 been over here in the sun.
04 13 16 35 CC Yes, they sure are, Bill. They can get you any
 specific numbers, whatnot, if you're interested.
04 13 16 50 LMP Well, I hate to say I wasn't interested, but I
 don't need any specific numbers right now.
04 13 16 56 CC Okay. Very good. We concur.
04 13 17 03 CC That's an outer space first.

Tape 72
Page 10
04 13 17 10 LMP On second thought, how's the evaporator outlet
 TEMP doing?
04 13 17 25 CC Forty-six degrees, Bill.
04 13 17 31 LMP Cancel that outer space first.
04 13 17 35 CC Roger.
04 13 17 49 CC How's Magellan coming along?
04 13 17 55 CMP I am getting a crossed eye looking at this thing.
 Hey, Mike, just as a matter of interest, I have
 been just looking at the earth the last hour and
 a half and there are two tremendous storms down
 there. I am not sure just where they are, but
 the vortices are huge.
04 13 18 14 CC Roger. Understand.
04 13 18 15 LMP That's your first space weather report at the
 manned weather forecast from space, and he's
 not so sure where it's raining, but it is raining
 somewhere.
04 13 18 26 CC Roger - -
04 13 18 27 LMP I'd also like to point out that Magellan is not
 a good analogy. I would also like to point out
 that Magellan is not a good analogy. I don't
 think he made it around.
04 13 18 36 CC Very good.
04 13 18 39 CMP How about Alford Chitister?
04 13 18 44 CC Roger. Alf.
04 13 19 27 CC I don't know how much detail you can see, Jim,
 but your subspacecraft point is out in the

Tape 72
Page 11
 middle of the Pacific Ocean about halfway between
 Australia and South America.
04 13 19 45 CMP Roger. The next time I take a look, I'll see
 what I - we are maneuver to the moon now. We'll
 see if we can see our shadow.
04 13 20 06 LMP Seriously, has anyone been able to see the spacecraft
 from earth? Optically?
04 13 20 18 CC We don't think so, Bill. We haven't been able to
 confirm that they have.
04 13 20 26 LMP Okay.
04 13 20 33 CC You are coming right down the center line of the
 airways. If you see the airliners going the other
 way, you better move over.
04 13 20 42 LMP That's the first time old Lovell's been on track
 for a long time.
04 13 20 48 CC Roger.
04 13 20 53 LMP Mike, an interesting viewpoint of the NAV sightings:
 maneuvering with the minimum impulse controller
 on the way home is a lot more difficult
 than going out because of all the fuel we don't
 have now. Every little pulse really moves the
 spacecraft around.
04 13 21 08 CC Roger. Understand. You have too much control for
 you.
04 13 21 14 LMP Now, yes.
04 13 21 19 CC Let Bruce beware.

Tape 72
Page 12
04 13 23 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 13 23 52 CMP Go ahead.
04 13 23 54 CC Howdy, Jim. Dick Underwood is over here. They're
 getting their film processing all prepared for your
 film when you get back and tentatively, can you
 give us some idea of how much you exposed?
04 13 24 08 CMP Let me - - let me introduce you to the great film
 man. He will tell you all about it.
04 13 24 12 CC Thank you.
04 13 24 15 LMP Tell him I hope he can account for haze through
 the windows. We - on our departure from the moon,
 we tried to burn up as much as - much of what we
 had left over, which was quite a bit, and tell him
 I hope he can develop the high-speed film taken
 at normal film settings.
04 13 24 47 CC Roger. Understand you used just about everything
 and a lot of the high speed; you used it to normal
 setting.
04 13 24 56 LMP Roger. We got it in the wrong bucket there a
 couple of times.
04 13 24 59 CC okay.
04 13 25 06 LMP We never did have a chance to do any night earthshine
stuff.
04 13 25 14 CC Say again about the earthshine, Bill.
04 13 25 18 LMP We never did have a chance to do any earthshine
 photography.

Tape 72
Page 13
04 13 25 21 CC Roger. Understand.
END OF TAPE

Tape 73
Page 1
04 01 55 51 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 01 55 57 CMP Go ahead.
04 01 56 00 CC Apollo 8, Houston. How are you coming along
 with your P23 marks?
04 01 56 06 CMP My eyeballs are getting square. That's what
 we have been doing most of the day, Ken. Are
 you receiving the data down below?
04 01 56 20 CC Roger. Looks like you are getting some pretty
 good marks. We have a pretty good hack on the
 vector and the matrix, and looks like if you
 wanted to terminate at this point, that we
 do have good data.
04 01 56 38 CMP Sounds good.  I'll terminate after this - -
04 01 56 41 CC Roger.
04 01 56 43 CMP - - trying to do star 01 again.
04 01 56 44 CC Roger.
04 01 59 20 CMP Ken, did you have a nice Christmas?
04 01 59 31 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Did you call?
04 14 15 52 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
04 14 16 07 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
04 14 16 10 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
04 14 16 17 LMP Who is this, Ken or Jerry?
04 14 16 20 CC Say again, please.
04 14 16 24 LMP This Ken?
04 14 16 29 CC Here's Ken. Go ahead.

Tape 73
Page 2
04 14 16 35 LMP Okay, Ken. We are getting back to the PTC
 attitude. Would you like us to do this high-gain
 REACQ test now on the first roll?
04 14 16 42 CC Affirmative.
04 14 16 55 LMP Okay. Look, how about if I just went to REACQ
 right now?
04 14 17 28 LMP Matter of fact I'm in REACQ. If you want me to
 stay here, why we'll just press on.
04 14 17 40 CC Okay, Apollo 8. That is fine.
04 14 17 44 LMP I guess this step about stopping in roll 150
 really doesn't matter too much then.
04 14 18 10 CC That's right, Bill. That was just to let you
 acquire.
04 14 18 17 LMP Man, we can acquire on the run here.
04 14 18 21 CC Hey, you are getting good at that.
04 14 18 25 LMP That's all they'll let me do.
04 14 18 30 LMP Okay. We will keep it here for two REV's, Ken.
 and - Frank and Jim are asleep, and ...
 so I'll just keep it going here for two rolls.
04 14 18 44 CC Okay. Real fine.
04 14 35 59 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
04 14 36 02 CC Go ahead, 8.
04 14 36 14 CC Go ahead, 8.
04 14 36 19 LMP Well, the REACQ didn't work as advertised. It
 looked like it went on by the scan limit and
 into the mechanical limit and followed MSFN
 around looking, out of the corner of its eye

Tape 73
Page 3
 on WIDE BEAM. And when MSFN came back underneath
 the spacecraft, why it snapped back on
 it to NARROW BEAM. It apparently never broke
 lock; or if it did, it was only instantaneously.
04 14 36 56 CC Roger. It looked like we did break lock there
 for about 8 minutes.
04 14 37 05 LMP Well, we might have broken two way lock, but I
 was still having about AGC right at the noise
 level, at the minimum reception level.
04 14 37 17 CC Roger.
04 14 37 30 LMP When we get out here in the clear zone, when
 we're definitely out of the scan limit, why,
 I'll go ahead and go to the MANUAL and AUTO
 lock-on sequence and switch over to REACQ and
 see what it does next time around.
04 14 37 43 CC Roger.
04 14 38 06 LMP Houston. Were you able to get high bit rate
 from the OMNI's now, by the way?
04 14 39 21 CC Apollo 8, Houston. The OMNI high bit rate
 capability is noisy, but usable.
04 14 39 31 LMP Okay. I think what we'll do here is, if I see
 the high gain definitely going past the scan
 limit before it gets the mechanical limit, I'll
 go ahead and ask - you could ask if the REACQ
 feature hasn't taken over I'll just go ahead
 and shut it down so that it'll remain in stops.

Tape 73
Page 4
04 14 40 00 LMP How's that sound?
04 14 40 01 CC We are talking about it now, Bill.
04 14 40 05 LMP Okay. It's my understanding that the scan
 warning limit of this thing is supposed to stop
 tracking; and break of lock, it'll travel on
 over to the thumb-wheel settings.
04 14 40 28 CC Roger. That's my understanding, Bill. We are
 talking about it right now. I'll let you know
 in just a second.
04 14 40 33 LMP Probably, Ken, we are not ever losing the earth's
 present signal.
04 14 40 38 CC That's correct.
04 14 42 01 CC Hey, Bill, can you tell us what angles this went
 through? The curve that we have plotted is
 apparently the RF limit rather than the mechanical
 limit; and discussing the function of the
 AUTO REACQ mode, it looks like it is supposed
 to shift when it hits the RF limit, which is
 your - should be your ENTER set of numbers
 as opposed to the scan warning limit. And if
 it went inside of that number, could you tell
 us about what kind of numbers it did go to?
04 14 42 35 LMP Roger. It went past the caution warning limit
 to the scan or RF limit, as I understand it.
 And let me give you a rundown on what it did
 here.

Tape 73
Page 5
04 14 42 44 CC Okay. Say it slow so I can copy it.
04 14 42 50 LMP Okay. The antenna went to about 330 to 270 yaw,
 plus 60 to 80 pitch. Copy?
04 14 43 15 CC Roger.
04 14 43 19 LMP Okay. The AGC dropped off to what I call our
 noise level, that was the voltage level on the
 AGC measured at - integrated when the noise
 broke in. It was about 11 o'clock position on
 the gage, and it looked like it was switching
 beam widths there off and on. It would pulse
 up and down, and a couple of times dropped to
 full-scale low very briefly.
04 14 43 52 CC Okay. You got some marks on that AGC that
 should register in volts, I believe. Do you
 have an indication other than 11 o'clock?
04 14 44 06 LMP Unfortunately, the numbers never got on here.
 If you will look on that chart that Fred Haise
 has, it shows one at 11 o'clock position which
 is the noise level. I don't remember what the
 voltage was. I might have it on my systems
 book, though.
04 14 44 24 CC Bill, - -
04 14 44 25 LMP When the antenna - when the antenna did snap
 back in, it went to yaw 60, pitch minus 5, with
 VERB 64 reading plus 67 for yaw and minus 10 for
 pitch.

Tape 73
Page 6
04 14 44 45 CC Okay. Yes, copy all that. I think you have
 four or five marks on that power meter, don't
 you? From what you are saying, I take it, it's
 between marks 2 and 4.
04 14 45 01 LMP Yes. Stand by a second.
04 14 45 15 LMP Stand by, Ken. I'll tell you what that mode is.
04 14 45 18 CC Thank you.
04 14 45 50 LMP Okay. It went to about - hovering around 2.4 to
 3 volts.
04 14 45 57 CC Okay. Thank you.
04 14 46 02 LMP Closer to 2.4.
04 14 46 03 CC Roger.
04 14 50 11 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 14 50 15 LMP Go ahead.
04 14 50 19 CC Okay. It's not real clear that it did, in fact,
 get to the mechanical stop, and if it does, the
 back room people say we can stay up against that
 stop for a maximum of 15 minutes without doing
 any damage. And we would kind of like to track
 it through one more time as is. We do have the
 high bit rate capability on OMNI's. So we would
 like to follow through that same configuration for
 one more REV.
04 14 50 55 LMP Stand by.
04 14 51 08 LMP Well, since we are not sure that it did get up
 against the mechanical stop last time for

Tape 73
Page 7
 10 minutes or so, I don't think it would be too
 smart to do it this time because we may end up
 having to switch field to high gain position.
04 14 51 32 CC I am sorry, Bill. You didn't come through.
 Say again, please.
04 14 51 38 LMP Since we are not - it is not clear to me that
 we weren't up against mechanical stops for a
 while on the last time around. That might
 account for 10 minutes of that 15 minutes, and
 there is no sense pushing our luck. I think
 we ought to - if it starts dropping off again,
 we just ought to go and put it back into MANUAL
 and take it back where it belongs. We are still
 a long way from home, and if that antenna switch
 fails, it's going to fail the high-gain position,
 and that's all we got.
04 14 52 18 CC Roger, Bill. And we will be making a handoff
 on stations at 5:5.
04 14 52 27 LMP Okay.
04 14 53 39 LMP Ken, we are going to switch COMM carriers here a
 second.
04 14 53 42 CC Okay, thank you.
04 14 53 52 LMP Relay that. We'll hold this configuration for
 a while.
04 14 53 55 CC okay.
04 14 56 03 CC Apollo 8, Houston through Honeysuckle.

Tape 73

04 14 56 10 LMP Roger. Read you five-by.
04 14 56 12 CC Thank you.
04 15 07 24 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
04 15 07 27 CC Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
04 15 07 32 LMP It did the same thing that time, Ken. This
 time the voltage AGC did drop to full-scale low
 for several seconds, but the antenna does seem
 to have the capabilities to look right through
 the spacecraft, and I guarantee, the earth went
 where the antenna was not supposed to be able
 to go. I
04 15 07 53 CC okay. I would just like to confirm with you that
 it never did go back to the present numbers.
04 15 08 02 LMP no, it apparently never lost earth presence signal.
 It sounds like it was trying to pick up
 one-way lock all the time, and we usually hovered
 around 2-volts AGC except for brief periods.
04 15 08 17 CC Okay. Thank you very much.
04 15 08 21 LMP It looks like if they had - should have not had
 the ... switch into WIDE BEAM until after it
 had gone to those preset limits.
04 15 09 04 LMP We are back in AUTO on the OMNI.
04 15 09 06 CC Okay. Thank you.
04 15 12 59 LMP Houston, CDR is up and manning the helms. We
 are going to switch COMM carriers. We'll be
 off the air for a little bit.

Tape 73

04 15 13 04 CC Okay. Thank you.

04 15 16 24 CDR Hey, Ken. This is Frank.
04 15 16 26 CC Good morning, sir.
04 15 17 01 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
04 15 17 03 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8. Loud and clear.
04 15 17 08 CDR How far are we from home, Ken?
04 15 17 10 CC Oh, about 152, looks like. That's pretty gross;
 I get you a real number in just a minute.
04 15 17 17 CDR 152?
04 15 17 37 CC 148 550; that's a good number.
04 15 17 44 CDR Very good.
04 15 17 53 CC And your velocity is about 4650.
04 15 18 07 CDR Increasing, huh?
04 15 18 09 CC That's affirm.
04 15 31 21 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
04 15 31 23 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
04 15 31 26 LMP We are trying to get back on our normal sleep
 cycle, and I just woke up here a little while
 ago, so I'm going to try to hit the hay again.
 It'd probably be a good idea to try another
 Seconal to try to get with it. What do you guys
 think down there?
04 15 31 46 CC okay. Sounds like a good idea, and if we can
 get Frank to tell us how much sack time he got,
why that'll go in the log, too.
04 15 32 04 CDR I was in bed for 7 hours, Ken, and I probably
 slept for about 4-1/2 to 5 hours of it, anyway.

Tape 74
Page 2
04 15 32 10 CC You're getting better. Good.
04 15 32 53 CDR If you - if you're interested in further reports,
 we've all had three meals today, and we have
 drunk a lot of water, and Jim's asleep now. He
 worked pretty hard this afternoon, but I think
 we are all in pretty good shape now.
04 15 33 06 CC Real fine. Thank you.
04 15 33 11 CDR Used the exerciser.
04 15 34 10 CDR Well, Ken, that just leaves you or I - how about
 you and I - did anything exciting happen today?
04 15 34 16 CC I think you know about all the things that are
 exciting up on your end, and it's real quiet down
 here. Everybody is smiling; Santa was good to most
 of the folks in the world, and everything is pretty
 calm, like it should be on Christmas.
04 15 34 35 CDR very good.
04 15 34 42 CC Milt says we're in a period of relaxed vigilance.
04 15 34 46 CDR Very good.
04 15 34 51 CDR We'll relax; you be vigilant.
04 15 34 54 CC That's a fair trade. (Laughter)
04 15 37 24 CDR Hey, Ken, has anybody got any good idea why that
 quad A tank is running hot, hotter than the rest
 by so much?
04 15 37 34 CC Okay. I didn't have an answer when I came on;
 just a second and we'll check again.
04 15 39 44 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 15 39 49 CDR Go ahead, Houston.

Tape 74
Page 3
04 15 39 52 CC Okay, Apollo 8. Let me tell you what the subjects
 are that we're going over down here: number
 one, we're making a review of all the entry
 procedures and this type of information, and we're
 going to actually go through and review the entry
 checklist. We have people that are still working
 on verification of your erasable memory, and we
 are looking at the EMS problem, and we're discussing
 the quad temperature, so I'll feed up some
 of these pieces of information as they come along,
 and right now we are just sort of having a status
 review.
04 15 40 34 CDR I don't think the EMS is much of a problem; it
 just jumps when you go into AUTO. I don't believe
 it will bother us for entry. I - I'm doing the
 same thing; I am looking over my entry checklist.
 One of the first things I see here is a coldsoak,
 and I don't think we want to evaporate between the
 last midcourse and entry, do we?
04 15 55 27 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 16 09 33 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 16 09 56 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
04 16 10 00 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
04 16 10 03 CC Roger. Looking at the flight plan, you have a P52
 coming up at a 115 hours, and we'll have to do
 another one at 119:45 in preparation for the P23.

Tape 74
Page 4
 And it's acceptable with the ground procedures
 if you would like to delay about 115-hour alignment,
 and do it just once at 119:45, or you can
 do it there in flight plan location. If you want
 to skip the 115-hour alignment we could go ahead
 and start in on the pitch and yaw free PTC mode
 at this time.
04 16 10 48 CDR What does that mean, Ken?
04 16 10 54 CC Okay. We have a DTO that requires that we do a
 PTC and go ahead and do it in minimum impulse
 mode so that we're not putting any attitude hold
 corrections in. And we're going to be tracking
 the attitude excursion, and they want this some -
 think like 6 hours - or until we reach a limit.
04 16 11 19 CDR okay.
04 16 11 30 CDR Cabin's running a little bit warmer today than
 normal.
04 16 11 35 CC I'm sorry; say it again.
04 16 11 38 CDR I say the cabin is running a little bit hotter
 today than it has been. It looks like this particular
 PTC alignment gets more sun in the cabin than
 the PTC before.
04 16 11 51 CC Roger. What kind of temperature are you recording now?
04 16 11 56 CDR About 78.
04 16 12 04 CDR I just put the window shades up. That'll cool
 it down.
