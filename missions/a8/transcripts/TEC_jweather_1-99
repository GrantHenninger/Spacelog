00 01 54 30 CC Roger. How does it feel up there?
00 01 54 33 CDR Very good, very good. Everything is going
 rather well. It looks just about the same way
 it did 3 years ago.
00 01 54 42 CC Has Bill got time from playing with his tape
 recorder to look out the window?
00 01 54 45 CDR Roger. We had one little incident here. Jim
 Lovell inadvertently popped one liferaft, so
 we've got one full Mae West with us here.
00 01 55 02 CC Roger. Understand.

00 02 58 07 CC Your cut-off looked very good down here. We
 have a whole room full of people that say you
 look good.
00 02 58 11 CDR Roger. Thank you. The only situation we have
 here in the O<sub>2</sub> flow is high, O<sub>2</sub> flow is a bit
 high.
00 02 58 22 CC Roger. Understand; O<sub>2</sub> flow high.
00 02 58 24 CMP We'll get to first status report here shortly.
00 02 58 26 CC Roger.
00 02 58 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Your booster configured normally,
 and we're not concerned with the O<sub>2</sub> high
 flow. We think it's normal.
00 02 59 05 CDR Okay.
00 02 59 52 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 02 59 54 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
00 02 59 56 CMP Roger. The DELTA-TIG looked like it was right
 on. Burn time appeared to us to be about 2 seconds
 longer, 517. VGX was reading 95485 when we
 got it. The attitude was nominal. V<sub>I</sub> was reading
 35452 at cut-off, H-dot 04552, and H is 01791.
 DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> on the EMS was minus 20.6.

 03:15:55, and SEP time, 03:20:55. Your SEP
 attitude, the gimbal angles on the PAD remain
 good.
00 03 01 06 CMP Roger. I have those times. The SEP time will
 be 03:20:55.
00 03 01 10 CC Right.

00 03 14 32 CC Stand by one.
00 03 14 50 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 03 14 51 CDR Go ahead.
00 03 14 52 CC We're reading about the same as we were before
 on that oxygen flow. The reason it's that high
 is due to the cabin gas changeover. According
 to Apollo 7, if your data repeats theirs, you
 can expect it to be high for another few hours.
00 03 15 10 CDR Roger. Thank you.
00 03 15 43 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 03 15 47 CDR Go ahead.

00 03 35 22 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 03 35 24 CC Roger. We would like to ask whether you did
 a VERB 66 ENTER to transfer the state vector
 from CSM to LM slot. We didn't copy that down
 here.
00 03 35 32 CDR We did not.
00 03 35 33 CC Okay.
00 03 35 34 CDR Do you want us to do that now?
00 03 35 36 CC At your convenience.

00 03 36 06 CMP And at the same time, we can see Africa. West
 Africa is beautiful. I can also see Gibraltar
 at the same time I'm looking at Florida.
00 03 36 20 CC Sounds good. Get a picture of it. What window
 are you looking out?
00 03 36 29 CMP The center window.
00 03 36 30 CC Roger.
00 03 36 39 CC Are your windows clear so far?
00 03 37 08 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 03 37 10 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
00 03 37 11 CC How about your VHF check? We would like to get
 that done before you get too much further away.
00 03 37 34 CDR Okay.
00 03 37 38 CDR We are listening on VHF alfa Simplex.
00 03 37 42 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
00 03 37 45 CDR We are listening for VHF alfa Simplex.
00 03 37 48 CC Okay, good. Thank you. VHF alfa Simplex, and
 we will get configured for it; and in between
 times, give us a clue as to what it looks like
 from way up there.
00 03 38 00 CMP Roger. Well, Mike, I can see the entire earth
 now out of the center window. I can see Florida,
 Cuba, Central America, the whole northern half

00 03 38 25 CC They picked a good day for it.
00 03 38 30 CDR Stand by. We are going through the separation
 maneuver checklist here.
00 03 38 34 CC Roger. Standing by.
00 03 39 20 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8. We've lost sight
 of the S-IVB here. The separation maneuver
 may be delayed slightly, or else we will go
 ahead and make it without having her in sight.
00 03 39 30 CC Roger. Understand, Frank.
00 03 41 58 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 03 42 01 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
00 03 42 03 CDR When does the S-IVB do their blowdown maneuver?
00 03 42 05 CC Stand by one.
00 03 42 42 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 03 42 46 CDR Go on.
00 03 42 48 CC Your blowdown will be 1 hour from now, a little
 more that 1 hour from now.
00 03 42 51 CDR Roger. We have the S-IVB in sight again now.
 We have done the separation maneuver.
00 03 42 55 CC Good show. Thank you.
00 03 43 25 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 03 43 31 LMP Go ahead, Houston.
00 03 43 32 CC we would like to take control of the DSE for a

00 03 43 54 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We would like to get an
 approximate GET of your SEP maneuver to use for
 our ephemeris tracking data.
00 03 44 06 CDR Roger. It was 3 hours 40 minutes zero seconds.
00 03 44 10 CC Good, 03:40 and a foot and a half - feet per second.
 Right?
00 03 44 15 CDR Roger. About that -
00 03 44 16 CC Okay.
00 03 44 18 CDR - We have the - Mike, we have the exact
 callout here for you and a burn status report.
00 03 44 22 CC Alright.

 yaw 0. Over.
00 03 44 46 CC Roger, Apollo 8.
00 03 46 25 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 03 46 29 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 03 46 31 CC Roger. At your convenience, would you please
 go P00 and ACCEPT? We're going to update to
 your W matrix. And also when you get a chance,
 we would like to know about the SLA panels. Did
 they all depart? And do you have any comments
 about the SLA?
00 03 46 43 CDR They all departed, and they worked fine.
00 03 46 47 CC Okay. Thank you.
00 03 46 58 CDR We are in P00 and ACCEPT.

Tape 5
Page 7
00 03 47 00 CC Thank you.
00 03 48 26 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. Will you give us the
 information when you want us to stop the venting
 and so on?
00 03 48 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.
00 03 50 39 CC Apollo 8. Houston.
00 03 50 42 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
00 03 50 44 CC Roger. What is the venting information are
 you inquiring about: the O<sub>2</sub> flow high out
 through the waste tank or waste compartment, or
 are you talking about your evaporator?
00 03 50 53 CDR Evaporator. We are configuring now to stop
 boiling.
00 03 50 56 CC Okay.
00 03 50 58 CC We concur in that.
00 03 51 02 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You can go back to BLOCK.
 We have gotten in the load to the W matrix
 update.
00 03 51 10 CDR Roger.
00 03 51 58 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. The back pressure valve is
 closed, and the water flow is OFF.
00 03 52 03 CC Back pressure valve closed, and water flow OFF.
 Thank you.
00 03 53 04 CDR Houston, Apollo 8 here.
00 03 53 05 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.

Tape 5
Page 8
00 03 53 07 CDR Roger. It looks like I might have to do a couple
 more small maneuvers to stay away from the front
 of this S-IVB, the way we are ending up now. Do
 you want me to do these with our P47 if we have to
 do them?
00 03 53 19 CC Standby one, Frank.
00 03 53 28 CC That's affirmative, Frank, on this P47.
00 03 53 30 CDR Okay. And give me the time again when it starts
 to dump, please.
00 03 53 35 CC Roger. We're working on an exact GET of that,
 Frank.
00 03 53 48 CDR Roger.
00 03 54 54 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 03 54 57 CDR Go ahead.
00 03 54 58 CC I'd like to give you some idea about your trajectory.
 It looks like a midcourse correction
 number 1, projected out to TLI plus 6 hours,
 would be only 7 feet per second. So, of course,
 any further maneuvers you do would add to that,
 which is probably good.
00 03 55 24 CDR I just want to stay from away from in front of
 this thing.
00 03 55 27 CC Roger. We concur. Looks like it is chasing
 you, huh?
00 03 55 32 CDR Yes.
00 03 55 53 LMP OMNI D.

Tape 5
Page 9
00 03 56 01 CDR Boy, it's starting to vent now, blowing down.
00 03 56 07 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
00 03 56 09 CDR The S-IVB is really venting.
00 03 56 13 CC Roger. Understand; that is supposedly a non-propulsive
 vent. The big blowdown maneuver, it
 starts maneuvering to blowdown attitude at
 04:44:55, and the vent occurs at 05:07:55.
00 03 56 32 CDR 05:07:55.
00 03 56 34 CC Roger.
00 03 56 35 CDR That is the nonpropulsive vent, but it's pretty
 spectacular. It's spewing out from all sides
 like a huge water sprinkler.
00 03 56 45 CC Roger. Get some pictures of it.
00 03 56 48 CDR We are.
00 03 57 07 CDR Say again that big vent time, so I can write it
 down please, Houston.
00 03 57 11 CC Roger. Big vent time 05:07:55, and it will start
 maneuvering to vent attitude beginning at
 04:44:55. Bill has got the tape recorder back.
00 03 57 32 CDR Thank you. Roger.
00 03 58 31 CDR We're receiving VHF music now, Houston. Thank
 you.
00 03 58 35 CC Yes, you took the words right out of my mouth,
 Frank, and we would like to know also how far
 away from the S-IVB you are now.
00 03 58 48 CDR I guess we are between 500 to 1000 feet.

Tape 5
Page 10
00 03 58 51 CC Roger.
00 03 58 57 CDR Herb Alpert seems pretty good.
00 03 59 00 CC Roger.
00 04 02 04 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 04 02 06 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 04 02 10 CDR Roger. I believe we are going to have to vent
 or thrust away from this thing; we seem to be
 getting closer.
00 04 02 18 CC Roger. Understand, Frank; go ahead whenever -
 just give us some idea of when you did it and
 how much.
00 04 02 24 CDR Roger.
00 04 02 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Could you stand by one?
 We are working on something here.
00 04 02 37 CDR Okay.
00 04 05 10 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 04 05 16 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
00 04 05 39 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
00 04 05 40 CDR You are loud and clear, Mike. Go ahead.
00 04 05 43 CC Okay, Frank. On your additional separation
 maneuver, we recommend that you make a radial
 burn, point your plus X-axis toward the earth,
 and thrust minus X for 3 feet per second.
 Over.
00 04 05 57 CDR I don't want to do that; I'll lose sight of the
 S-IVB.

Tape 5
Page 11
00 04 06 01 CC Okay. The reason we want a radial burn is to
 increase your midcourse correction so we can
 use the SPS. Stand by on it.
00 04 06 33 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 04 06 35 CDR Go ahead.
00 04 06 36 CC How close to a radial burn can you get without
 losing sight of the S-IVB, Frank?
00 04 06 41 CDR Well, I don't know because I can't see the
 earth now, Mike.
00 04 06 44 CC Okay.
00 04 06 51 CDR We can pitch down some. Jim has the earth in
 the optics so we could pitch some and get
 pretty close to one, I guess.
00 04 07 31 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 04 07 32 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 04 07 34 CC We can give you a pitch gimbal angle on radial
 direction if that would be a help. It's
 181 degrees; pitch gimbal angle would be
 exactly radial at 4 hours and 10 minutes. I
 don't know whether that solves your visibility
 problem or not.
00 04 07 46 CDR 181?
00 04 07 47 CC That's affirmative.
00 04 07 54 CDR Well, then zero would be just as good, wouldn't
 it?

Tape 5
Page 12
00 04 08 05 CC Frank, if you use zero, then make the SEP if
 possible in the plus X thrusters. That's the
 direction of the burn we'd like.
00 04 08 13 CDR Well, can't do that. I'll thrust right square
 into that S-IVB.
00 04 08 16 CC Yes, okay. Understand.
00 04 08 22 CDR What will he maneuver to as far as the gimbal
 angle for his blowdown?
00 04 09 03 CC Apollo 8, Houston. At blowdown, that S-IVB
 should be oriented to perform a retrograde
 blowdown along the local horizontal.
00 04 09 14 CDR Okay.
00 04 09 22 CC Is it still chasing? Does it look like it is
 closing on you, Frank?
00 04 09 25 CDR It is about the same. The trouble is it is
 pointed at us pretty well.
00 04 09 30 CC Roger. Understand.
00 04 10 00 CC Frank, what we want to do is get a radial
 upward burn; and as long as you can, through the
 optics or some other means out the window, figure
 out where the earth is, then use the appropriate
 thrusters to thrust upward, radially upward for
 3 feet per second. That is what we are looking
 for for trajectory reasons.
00 04 10 18 CDR Okay. Understand. I just - as I say, I just
 can't very well do that now. I don't want to
 lose sight of this S-IVB.

Tape 5
Page 13
00 04 10 26 CC Roger. We concur with that. I just thought
 perhaps Jim, through his optics, or you could
 get some feel for where the earth is. That's
 what we want to do, is radially upward.
00 04 10 35 CDR Okay. As soon as we find the earth, we will
 do it.
00 04 10 37 CC Thank you.
00 04 11 03 CDR Houston. The venting on the S-IVB is terminated.
00 04 11 08 CC Roger. Thank you.
00 04 13 53 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 04 13 55 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 04 13 56 CC Roger. Frank, do you think you are going to
 be able to do this burn radially? We would
 like to add to its magnitude if you are going
 to make it in some other direction. Over.
00 04 14 08 CDR No, I am not even sure we are going to do it
 yet, Mike. If I can get - we seem to be
 drifting away from this thing a little bit,
 although it is still pointing at us quite
 closer than I'd like.
00 04 14 20 CC Roger. Understand.
00 04 14 25 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We would like you to do
 some additional maneuver; it is just a question
 of how much and in which direction.
00 04 14 33 CDR Okay. Right now, our gimbal angles are about -
 roll's about 190 and pitch is about 320 and

Tape 5
Page 14
 yaw is about 340. We could certainly do it
 in this position. That would be alright.
00 04 14 51 CC Stand by. We will check those.
00 04 17 06 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 04 17 09 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 04 17 11 CC Roger, Frank. You could help us out if you
 would explain where you are relative to the
 booster. In other words, with respect to the
 earth and the radius back there, are you above
 or below or one side, or where exactly is the
 booster relative to you?
00 04 17 27 CDR Well, it's as I said before. We can't definitely
 find the earth. I think we are in front
 and a little bit above - a little bit above
 the - almost in front of the - directly in
 the front of the booster.
00 04 17 41 CC Roger. Understand; almost directly in front
 of the booster.
00 04 17 45 CDR Perhaps a little bit horizontally displaced
 towards the - let's see - Houston, to help
 you, we are looking right directly above the
 S-IVB with the sun - it's on the right side of
 the S-IVB and on our - coming in our left number
 1 window.
00 04 18 34 CC Okay. Understand; the sun is on the right side
 of the S-IVB and coming in your number 1 window.

Tape5
Page 15
 And are you - when you give us those angles, that
 means that your plus X-axis is pointed at it with
 those angles. Is that affirm?
00 04 18 47 CDR Roger.
00 04 18 48 CC Okay.
00 04 19 04 CDR The earth is in our plus Y, plus Z-direction
 now, Mike.
00 04 19 09 CC Thank you. Earth is plus Y, plus Z.
00 04 19 12 CDR Right, and a little minus X.
00 04 19 16 CC Okay.
00 04 20 52 CMP Houston, for information. I am looking through
 the scanning telescope now, and I see millions
 of stars; most of them - the venting from the
 S-IVB.
00 04 21 04 CC Right. Are you having any trouble telling which
 are the stars and which are the S-IVB particles?
00 04 21 09 CMP Definitely; we are in sunlight, and it looks
 like they are all S-IVB, but we don't know. I
 am going to attempt a P52 realign at this time
 and see what I can do.
00 04 21 18 CC Understand you.
00 04 26 37 CDR Mike, anything more on this separation maneuver
 you're on?
00 04 26 41 CC We are working on it, Frank. We are trying to
 compute what radially outward will be in close
 terms. Now, you still have the earth - as I

Tape 5
Page 16
 understand plus Y and plus Z quadrant. In other
 words, it's down below you on your right and
 slightly to your rear? Is that still true?
00 04 26 59 CDR That's right. Quite a bit to our rear and down
 below us. Off to the right.
00 04 27 03 CC Okay. Well, we - of course, in that attitude,
 you want to burn some upward and some to the
 left, and we are trying to be more precise than
 that. Frank, is it still about the same distance
 away? Are you opening or closing?
00 04 27 23 CDR It sure is staying close to us.
00 04 27 25 CC Understand.
00 04 28 03 CDR Mike, can you just tell us which way the S-IVB
 pitches and how far it will pitch to the sling
 shot maneuver attitude?
00 04 28 11 CC Roger. Stand by.
00 04 28 46 CC Frank, the S-IVB is within 10 degrees of its
 final attitude at this time.
00 04 28 52 CDR Okay. Thank you.
00 04 29 00 LMP Houston, are you ready to copy the IMU align
 information?
00 04 29 03 CC Go ahead.
00 04 29 05 LMP Alright. Star ID is 03, and star 36, star angle
 difference 0.01, torquing angle X minus 00034,
 Y minus 0027, Z plus 00100. Over.
00 04 29 33 CC Okay, thank you. For Y, I just got four digits
 here: 0027.

Tape 5
Page 17
00 04 29 39 LMP Roger. Three zeros: 00027.
00 04 29 43 CC Thank you.
00 04 29 46 CMP Houston, we are going to have to hold up on the
 cislunar navigation until after this next little
 maneuver.
00 04 29 53 CC Roger, Jim. We understand.
00 04 31 20 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 04 31 22 CDR Go ahead now, Mike.
00 04 31 23 CC Can you give us an updated readout of your
 gimbal angles. When your plus X-axis is pointed
 toward the booster, please?
00 04 31 29 CDR Roger. Stand by.
00 04 34 08 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 04 34 11 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
00 04 34 12 CC Could you give us those gimbal angles, Frank,
 when you have a chance?
00 04 34 14 CDR I'm getting the COAS right on it now so it will
 be accurate.
00 04 34 18 CC Thank you.
00 04 34 28 CDR Okay. With the COAS right on the S-IVB, the
 roll reads 105, the pitch is 275, and the yaw
 is about 325.
00 04 34 47 CC Roger. Copy roll 105, pitch 275, and yaw 325.
00 04 34 53 CDR Roger. That should be 115 for the roll.
00 04 35 46 CC Thank you. 115 roll.
00 04 35 52 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

Tape 5
Page 18
00 04 35 58 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
00 04 36 00 LMP Roger. If it will help you any, Mike, the
 earth is plus Y about 45 degrees in a minus X.
 I can see it out my side window, and it's a
 beautiful view with numerous cloud vortex.
00 04 36 15 CC Roger, Bill. Thank you. Understand; plus X
 45 degrees halfway between plus Y and plus Z
 and slightly minus X.
00 04 36 26 LMP Negative. It's 45 degrees in the plus Y, in
 the XY plane towards minus X. Over.
00 04 36 37 CC Roger. Understand in the XY plane, toward
 X 45 degrees.
00 04 36 43 LMP Forty-five degrees from plus Y to minus X.
00 04 36 48 CC Roger. Thank you.
00 04 36 51 LMP It's behind us to the right, if that will help.
00 04 36 54 CC Roger.
00 04 37 15 CDR I can still see the Cape and isthmus of Central
 America.
00 04 37 22 CC Roger. Understand. Frank, what we want on
 this burn is 8 feet per second now, 8 feet per
 second. We want it radially upward, and we
 want you to use whatever thrusters are required
 to burn radially upward at 8 feet per second.
00 04 37 37 CDR Why do you want to use - do so much, Mike?
00 04 37 42 CC Because of the separation distance we would
 like to achieve between now and the time of
 S-IVB blowdown.

Tape 5
Page 19
00 04 37 53 CDR Okay.
00 04 38 56 CDR Mike, do you want me to go ahead and try to
 do this, or are you going to give me some gimbal
 angles?
00 04 39 05 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead and do it without
 gimbal angles, if you can do that. Over.
00 04 39 11 CDR Okay. I don't understand why you want so many
 feet per second on it, but I think I can - with
 just a little maneuvering, I can get away from
 it a lot simpler than that.
00 04 39 22 CC Well, we would like the radial upward for trajectory
 reasons, and the magnitude we'd like
 because of the separation distance which we're
 predicting you will have at S-IVB blowdown.
00 04 39 31 CDR Okay.
00 04 39 54 CDR VHF sounds good.
00 04 39 57 CC Roger. On the VHF.
00 04 41 25 CMP OMNI B.
00 04 41 27 CC Understand; OMNI B Baker.
00 04 41 59 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 04 42 01 LMP Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 04 42 03 CC Roger. About 12 minutes before your big
 blowdown, there is a small continuous vent
 which opens at a GET of 04:55:55. You may
 notice that on the booster, 12- or 15-pound
 thrust.

Tape 5
Page 20
00 04 42 19 LMP Okay.
00 04 42 25 CC And, Apollo 8, could you give us your burn
 information whenever you have it?
00 04 42 30 LMP Roger. We are maneuvering to the attitude now.
00 04 42 33 CC Okay.
00 04 43 18 CDR Okay, Houston. I understand you want 8 feet
 per second burn, is that right?
00 04 43 21 CC Right. Eight feet per second, radially upward.
00 04 43 33 CDR Well, we are as close to being radially upward
 as we can determine.
00 04 43 36 CC Roger.

-- -- -- -- CC Apollo 8, Houston. Are you going to use P47 to
 monitor the burn?
-- -- -- -- CMP Yes, Jim, that's Roger. We are putting it in
 right now.
-- -- -- -- CC Thank you.
00 04 45 05 CDR Maneuvering now.
00 04 45 06 CC Thank you.
00 04 45 54 CDR Houston, we made the burn at 7.7 plus X plus
 00001 Y; and Z's are all zeros. Gimbal angles,
 roll 180, pitch 310, and yaw 020.
00 04 46 19 CC Roger. I copy plus X 7.7. Y 0.1; and roll,
 pitch, and yaw 180, 310, and 20.
00 04 46 30 CDR Did you get that information, Houston?
00 04 46 33 CC Apollo 8, Houston. How are you reading?
00 04 46 36 CDR Read you loud and clear. Did you get the information?
00 04 46 38 CC That's affirmative. I say again, we copied
 plus X 7.7, one-tenth in Y, no Z; roll, pitch,
 and yaw, 180, 310, and 020.
00 04 46 52 CDR Roger. The burn was made at - initiated at
 04:45.
00 04 47 06 CC Roger. Copy 04:45 --
00 04 47 30 CDR Okay. Do you want us to transfer that to the
 CS - to the LM state vector or just leave it
 alone? You --
00 04 47 39 CC Affirmative, Frank. We would like you to transfer
 from the CSM to the LM state vector.

Tape 6

00 04 47 43 CDR Roger.
00 04 50 33 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 04 50 35 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 04 50 37 CC How is that booster looking now? Is it drifting
 away rapidly, or how does it look?
00 04 50 41 CDR Bill is the only one that can see it. Just a
 minute
00 04 50 45 LMP We're 90 degrees from its X-axis, and we must
 be out 1000 feet and moving out.
00 04 50 53 CC Roger. Understand; 90 degrees from its X-axis
 and about 1000 feet and separating.
00 04 50 59 LMP Plus or minus a couple of thousand.
00 04 51 03 CC Understand.
00 04 51 58 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8. I think we've got
 clearance now; we got a little behind on our
 P23's, but I suggest we go ahead and start those
 now.
00 04 52 06 CC Roger. Stand by.
00 04 52 38 CDR We're well clear of the S-IVB now, Houston.
00 04 52 40 CC Roger, Bill. Thank you, and at your convenience,
 could you give us the PRD reading? And as far
 as the P23 goes, that's just fine to get started
 with it. It looks like your first star, which
 is number 14, should be good until about 05:15 GET.
 Over.
00 04 53 02 LMP Roger. We'll start P23.

Tape 6
Page 3
00 04 54 18 LMP Houston, Apollo 8 with a PRD reading.
00 04 54 21 CC Go ahead.
00 04 54 23 LMP Roger. At 4 hours 4 minutes, Commander is 0,
 CMP 0.64, LMP 0.02.
00 04 54 34 CC Got that. Copy left to right: 0, 0.64, and
 0.02 at 4 hours and 4 minutes. Thank you.
00 04 54 43 LMP Roger. At 04:53, it was 0.01, 0.64, 0.03, and
 negligible on the survey meter.
00 04 54 53 CC Roger. Thank you.
00 04 55 12 CDR I have a beautiful view of the S-IVB and the
 earth here on one. I'll try and get a picture
 for you.
00 04 55 18 CC Hope so.
00 04 55 27 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We've got you about a minute
 away from the continuous vent open and 14 minutes
 away from the big dump, and we would like an estimate
 on your distance now if you can give it.
00 04 55 46 CDR Stand by. Our distance is about 3000 feet we
 would estimate.
00 04 55 50 CC Thank you.
00 04 56 38 CDR And we can see the vent.
00 04 56 44 CC Apollo 8. Houston. Say again.
00 04 56 47 CDR We can see the vent.
00 04 56 49 CC Roger. Thank you.
00 04 58 31 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 04 58 33 CC Go ahead, Jim.


Tape 6
Page 4
00 04 58 35 CMP Boy, it's really hard to describe what this earth
 looks like. I'm looking out my center window,
 which is a round window, and the window is bigger
 than the earth is right now. I can clearly see
 the terminator. I can see most of South America,
 all the way up to Central America, Yucatan, and
 the peninsula of Florida. There is a big swirling
 motion just off the east coast, and then going
 on over toward the east, I can still see West
 Africa, which has a few clouds right now. We can
 see all the way down to Cape Horn in South America.
00 04 59 21 CC Good grief, that must be quite a view.
00 04 59 24 CDR Yes. Tell the people in Tierra Del Fuego to put
 on their raincoats; looks like a storm is
 out there.
00 04 59 31 CC Roger. Will do. Do you care to give them a
 24-hour forecast?
00 04 59 41 CDR Probably as good as any other.
00 05 05 13 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 05 05 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
00 05 05 22 CDR Roger. You might be interested to know the center
 window is pretty well fogged up, but the
 other four seem to be in pretty good shape.
00 05 05 29 CC Glad to hear you've got four out of five, and
 your big dump will be coming up in 2 minutes or
 so.

Tape 6
Page 5
00 05 05 35 CDR Roger. We're standing by.
00 05 06 48 CDR The S-IVB has started dump.
00 05 07 19 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 05 07 20 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
00 05 07 22 CMP Roger. Mike, did you say star 14 was good till
 about 05:30 or something?
00 05 07 27 CC Yes. Stand by while I give you that time again.
 Star number 14 should be good for about another
 8 minutes, Jim - 7 minutes.
00 05 07 41 CMP Okay. Now be advised, the optics calibration
 is very difficult to do because of all the other
 little stars floating here. I'm going
 to ..., bypass it and do it at the end of this.
00 05 07 59 CC Roger, Apollo 8. Understand.
00 05 08 10 CC You should have the LOX dump now, Apollo 8.
00 05 08 21 CMP Houston, this is 8. I'm looking through the
 scanning telescope and that LOX dump and just
 blanked out completely the entire scanning telescope.
00 05 08 30 CC Understand.
00 05 08 32 CDR It's a fantastic sight, Bill. Looks like the
 S-IVB, a small attitude excursion while it's
 dumping.
00 05 08 38 CC Roger. Understand.
00 05 11 31 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 05 11 34 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

Tape 6
Page 6
00 05 11 36 CC Roger. I've got a flight plan update for Bill
 if he's ready to copy.
00 05 11 41 CDR Stand by.
00 05 11 42 CMP Stand by.
00 05 11 54 CMP Ready to copy.
00 05 11 55 CC Okay. We are about 05:10 GET where we will record
 the BLOCK data TLI plus four and TLI
 plus 11. The TLI plus four PAD that we gave you
 before is perfectly all right. We will not require
 that one, and we will have the TLI plus 11
 hour PAD for you shortly, then at 05:45 or 6 hours
 on that high-gain antenna checkout. Roger.
 Standing by.
00 05 12 28 CDR We are on OMNI D, and we heard - we lost you after
 - TM plus four was okay.
00 05 12 32 CC Okay. The TLI plus 4 hour PAD is okay. We will
 have the TLI plus 11 hour PAD for you shortly, and
 at 05:50, for your high-gain antenna checkout, we
 would like you to leave that switch in WIDE BEAM
 with reference to our conversation the other day;
 leave it in WIDE.
00 05 12 52 CDR Roger. Don't want to zap your receivers.
00 05 12 55 CC No, it has to do with some loss of tracking data,
 so it is better to leave it WIDE.
00 05 13 00 CDR Okay.
00 05 16 41 CMP	Houston, Apollo 8. Are you recording what we are
 getting out of 23?

Tape 6
Page 7
00 05 16 44 CC Stand by one, Jim; I'll check.
00 05 17 27 CC That is affirmative, Jim; we are copying your
 P23.
00 05 17 32 CMP Pretty big numbers there.
00 05 17 34 CC Well, we think that is because you bypassed the
 trunnion check.
00 05 17 40 CMP Roger.
00 05 22 18 CMP Houston, we are getting some really big numbers
 in DELTA-R and DELTA-V.
00 05 22 23 CC Roger. Understand, Jim.
00 05 22 25 CMP Do you want us to proceed with this, or should
 we just leave them alone?
00 05 22 32 CC Apollo 8, my again.
00 05 22 34 CMP Do you want us to accept these, or should we
 leave them alone?
00 05 22 37 CC Stand by.
00 05 23 46 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 05 23 49 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
00 05 23 50 CC Roger. We do not wish you to accept those marks.
 This is due to the fact that in bypassing the
 trunnion bias check, you still have big numbers
 left in those registers, so you go ahead when -
 after you do the trunnion bias check. Those numbers
 will become small later, but do not accept
 them right now.
00 05 24 11 CDR Understand, Houston.

Tape 6
Page 8
00 05 24 13 CC We have a TLI plus 11 hour update for you when
 you are ready to copy.
00 05 24 20 CDR Stand by.
00 05 25 00 LMP Roger. Ready to copy TLI plus 11.
00 05 25 04 CC Roger, Bill. TLI plus 11, and this assumes no
 midcourse correction number 1: it's an SPS/G&N;
 63330 minus 163 plus 129. Are you with me so far?
00 05 25 30 LMP Roger.
00 05 25 32 CC Okay. 013:56:47.59 minus 00489 plus 00000 plus
 47250 177 144 000, not applicable, plus 00197
 47253 554 47050 12 1278 256 023, up 265, left 18.

00 05 31 08 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 05 31 10 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
00 05 31 13 CMP Roger, Mike. I'd like to give some comments
 on P23 data. The auto maneuver was quite
 accurate. Looks like we got some substellar
 point in the maneuver; auto optics put Canopus
 straight where it should be; minimum impulse
 control worked as advertised. At the altitudes
 at which I started to do the sightings, they
 have a definite hazy band line. The filter
 gives the earth a glow, sort of an orangey
 glow. It's very indefinite of where to put the
 star, but there does seem to be a solid line
 where you might expect the horizon to be that

Tape 6
Page 10
 appears through the haze where we expect the
 atmosphere to be. I followed the procedure
 which we had done up at MIT, about two lines
 atop the haze layer a definite line for these
 sightings. In regards to the optics calibration,
 it was very difficult to find a star in
 the landmark line of sight in the venting of
 the S-IVB.
00 05 32 33 CC Roger, Apollo 8. We copied that, and we'd
 like for you to do that trunnion check, that
 calibration, prior to your next set of sightings.
00 05 32 44 CMP Roger. Will do. Canopus just disappeared
 from view, and maybe when we get a little
 time here, I'll try to get a calibration the
 first time.
00 05 32 56 CC Roger. Understand.
00 05 33 00 LMP And, Houston, we've rewound the tape; you can
 dump it at your convenience.
00 05 33 07 CC Roger, Bill. Thank you. Are you still picking
 up anything on the VHF?
00 05 33 15 LMP Are you playing anything?
00 05 33 17 CC Affirmative.
00 05 33 41 LMP No, I'm not picking anything up.
00 05 33 43 CC Roger. Thank you.
00 05 33 44 LMP What's our altitude now?

Tape 6
Page 11
00 05 33 50 CC Well, you're about 22 000 miles.
00 05 33 55 LMP Okay.
00 05 33 56 CC Give or take a thousand feet.
00 05 33 59 LMP I'll go ahead and turn VHF-A off and high gain.
00 05 34 03 CC Roger, Bill. Thank you.
00 05 34 06 LMP It was some pretty nice music while it lasted.
00 05 34 09 CC Yes, I bet so.
00 05 35 01 CC Apollo 8, Houston,
00 05 35 04 CMP Go ahead, Houston.
00 05 35 07 CC We're going to have to wait until we get the
 high-gain antenna locked on again to dump the
 tape.
00 05 35 15 CDR Okay. And you are about ready for us to go to
 the PTC attitude?
00 05 35 23 CC Stand by one.
00 05 35 26 CDR Okay.
00 05 35 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 05 36 00 CDR Go ahead.
00 05 36 01 CC We'd like to hold off on the PTC and get some
 more P23 information. We'll have some more
 details of that for you shortly.
00 05 36 09 CDR Alright.
00 05 36 10 CMP Mike, what I'm doing now, I'm going over to
 the star Sirius ...
00 05 36 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You faded out completely,
 Jim. I heard Frank, but it faded when you began
 talking. Say again.

Tape 6
Page 12
00 05 36 38 CMP Roger. I have switched to Sirius, the second
 star in the first set, to see if I can't get
 an optics calibration on it, at least.
00 05 36 49 CC Roger. That's fine. We'll have some more
 good words for you shortly.
00 05 38 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 05 38 18 CMP Go ahead.
00 05 38 19 CC Jim, on your P23, we'd like to go ahead and
 do the calibration and then use star number 15
 and take three sets, followed by star number 16,
 two sets. Over.
00 05 38 38 CMP Roger, Houston. That's what we're trying to
 do. I'm trying to get 15 for an optics CAL.
 It's been very difficult with the bright earth
 to find a star that we can get into the sextant.
 I'm trying to use the auto optics in P23 to get
 the star. We have that now; we're trying to
 maneuver the spacecraft to bring the trunnion to
 zero so we can get the landmark line of sight.
00 05 39 01 CC Roger. Understand. And I also have your PTC
 attitude, which is different than you have. I'll
 give that to you whenever you get a free moment.
00 05 39 16 CDR Ready to copy.
00 05 39 18 CC Alright. PTC attitude will be pitch 242; yaw is
 020. Over.
00 05 39 29 LMP pitch 242, yaw 020. Copy.

Tape 6
Page 13
00 05 39 33 CC Very good; thank you.
00 05 50 56 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
00 05 51 00 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
00 05 5103 LMP Roger. We'll hold up on the high-gain check
 until we get out of P23.
00 05 51 07 CC Roger, Bill. Thank you.
00 05 51 15 CC You may have to delay your lunch a little bit.
 Are you hungry?
00 05 51 19 LMP No.
00 05 51 22 CC First time I ever heard you say that.
00 05 52 11 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 05 52 13 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 05 52 14 CC Roger. It looks to us like the S-IVB is behaving
 completely normally in regard to all the
 blowdowns and other sequential events that take
 place. It looks good.
00 05 52 24 CDR Roger. How far away is it from us now?
00 05 52 29 CC We were going to ask you.
00 05 52 31 CDR (Laughter) Okay.
00 05 52 33 CMP Fifty miles.
00 05 52 34 CC Roger. Copy.
00 05 52 41 CDR Let's make that 80 kilometers, since there are
 some international aspects to this flight.
00 05 52 49 CC Roger.
00 05 53 52 CMP Okay, Houston. We did an optics calibration;
 we get zeros all the time.

Tape 6
Page 14
00 05 53 58 CC Roger. Understand; optics calibration and zeros
 all the time. Good.
00 05 54 03 CMP It takes a lot longer to do it, though. I had
 to go to a star like Sirius to finally see it.
00 05 54 09 CC Roger. Understand. We are real glad you got
 that so we can get a horizon calibration to put
 in the computer.
00 05 54 55 CDR Looks like the number 5 window is starting to
 fog up, Houston.
00 05 55 01 CC Roger, Houston. Understand it's the number 5
 that is fogging up.
00 05 55 48 CMP Houston, P23 coming through with Sirius.
00 05 55 53 CC Roger. Thank you.
00 05 55 54 CMP A little better, these numbers are a little better.
00 05 55 57 CC We would expect so.
00 06 07 16 CDR Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
00 06 07 18 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
00 06 07 21 CDR Roger. Have you been getting the downlink on
 the P23?
00 06 07 25 CC That is affirmative.
00 06 07 28 CDR Okay. Now how much longer do you want us to
 hold off going to PTC?
00 06 07 33 CC Stand by one, Frank.
00 06 13 16 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 06 13 18 CC Apollo 8, Houston.

Tape 6
Page 15
00 06 13 24 CC Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
00 06 13 26 CMP Roger. Are you recording all of the data from
 23, or do you want some read down to you?
00 06 13 37 CC Stand by, Jim. We think we are getting it all.
 We are confirming now. That is affirmative, Jim.
 We are getting all that is coming down. How is
 it going?
00 06 13 47 CMP It's working very nicely. I finished - one set
 was Sirius, three stars, and one set with Procyon,
 or two sightings; three sightings with
 Sirius and two with Procyon.
00 06 14 03 CDR Okay, Houston. This is Apollo 8. We are ready
 to go to the PTC attitude.
00 06 14 10 CC Roger, Frank. Understand. And we understand
 you've completed all sets, three on one and two
 on another in P23. Is that right?
00 06 14 16 CDR That's affirmative. But we've finished the five
 sightings, three on 15 and two on 16.
00 06 16 18 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 06 16 20 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 06 16 22 CC Roger, Frank. What we are doing down here is
 this. We'd really like the horizon calibration.
 We would like a total of 15 marks; you know,
 three sets on one star, two on the other. On
 the other hand, we are balancing that with the
 need to go to PTC, and we are not losing sight

Tape 6
Page 16
 of the fact that you want to go to PTC right
 away. So if you will bear with us another couple
 of minutes, we are trying to decide whether to
 ask you to go back and do some more of P23 or
 whether to clear you at this time to go to PTC.
 Over.
00 06 16 50 CDR Okay. We started maneuvering to PTC. We are
 getting kind of far behind, and what I am concerned
 about, Mike, Jim is now taking off his
 pressure suit.
00 06 17 00 CC Roger. Understand. How about you and Bill?
00 06 17 03 CDR Well, we are standing by till he gets through.
00 06 17 04 CC Understand. And you are maneuvering to PTC.
 That's fine.
00 06 17 09 CDR Well, I would prefer to do that, but we will --
00 06 17 14 CC Okay. Stand by just one.
END OF TAPE

Tape 7
Page 1
00 06 22 12 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 06 22 14 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 06 22 17 CC Roger. We would like to hold off on the
 passive thermal control until 7 hours GET and,
 in the meantime, to get as many more P23 marks
 as we can, starting with the first star and
 doing two sets of three marks each, and then
 going to the second star we gave you. And
 concurrent with that, if possible, we would
 like Bill to run this high-gain antenna checkout
 if Lovell's attitude is compatible with
 that.
00 06 22 49 CDR Okay. But they have not been to date. We
 are almost to the passive thermal control
 attitude now, and Jim is just halfway through
 taking his suit off.
00 06 22 58 CC Roger. Understand.
00 06 23 01 CDR We'll have to hold off for a minute here.
00 06 23 10 CC Roger, Frank. And the reason for this is the
 horizon calibration requires a number of points
 to give you good data for the onboard NAV coming
 on.
00 06 23 21 CDR Roger. We understand. We will be right back
 with you; just have to wait a minute here.
00 06 23 26 CC Roger. Thank you.
00 06 23 28 CDR That failing to separate from the S-IVB kind
 of fouled us up a little.

Tape 7
Page 2
00 06 23 32 CC Understand.
00 06 27 21 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
00 06 27 24 CC Apollo 8. Go ahead.
00 06 27 27 CDR Roger. We are standing by. Are you about
 ready for the high-gain antenna trial?
00 06 27 33 CC Okay. Just a second; we will check on that.
 Then are you in a position where you can go
 back to the star sightings?
00 06 27 40 CDR Well, we will be, but we can't until Jim gets
 ready.
00 06 27 44 CC Okay. We will stand, and you give us a mark
 on that. In just a second, I will check on
 the antenna. Okay. It looks like we are
 ready to go on the high-gain antenna check.
 And we can either go with commands called out
 from the ground, and you can monitor it, or
 you can be talked through it, whichever you
 prefer.
00 06 28 11 CDR Well, stand by. I guess we are not quite in
 a proper attitude yet.
00 06 28 15 CC Roger.
00 06 28 17 CDR We are slowly getting it.
00 06 32 42 CDR Houston. Apollo 8.
00 06 32 52 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 06 32 56 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Did you call?
00 06 32 59 CDR Roger. Thus is the high-gain antenna on
 wide auto.

Tape 7
Page 3
00 06 33 04 CC Roger.
00 06 35 21 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 06 35 24 CC Go ahead,Apollo8.
00 06 35 26 CDR Are you getting the results you want from our
 high-gain antenna?
00 06 35 45 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Affirmative. We are
 getting your data, and we are may have a beam width
 change, but stand by on that.
00 06 35 53 CDR Alright. We're standing by. Jim's about
 ready to go back to the P23.
00 06 35 57 CC Roger. We have a GO until 7 hours on the
 start of the PTC.
00 06 36 05 CDR Roger. Seven.
00 06 36 54 CC Houston, Apollo 8.
00 06 36 57 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
00 06 36 59 CDR We're on the PTC mode now waiting for Jim,
 and I noticed that out my window now I can
 see Orion very clearly, even though the sun
 is bright in the other window.
00 06 37 13 CC Roger.
00 06 37 14 CDR It almost pained me to say that, but it's true.
00 06 37 19 CC Roger.
00 06 37 22 CDR Speaking of the windows, the number 5 window
 is getting pretty well obscured and the number
 3 window is unusable.
00 06 37 29 CC Roger. Understand; number 3 is unusable and
 number 5 is obscured. Can you make out any

Tape 7
Page 4
 definition at all, or do you have a target to
 look at?
00 06 37 39 CDR Well, I can see the sun. Wait till it comes
 around the earth, and I'll give you a better
 hack on that.
00 06 37 42 CC Okay.
00 06 38 14 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We're going to go ahead
 and try to dump your tape right now. Circuit
 margins aren't too good at our present configuration.
 We're going to take a look at
 it. If it doesn't work, we may have to dump
 it again at a later configuration.
00 06 38 30 CDR Roger.
00 06 42 57 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. We're maneuvering back
 now to do another P23.
00 06 43 02 CC Roger. Thank you.
00 06 43 29 CMP Houston, this is Apollo 8. I'll do two more
 sets on 15, and then we'll do one set on 16.
00 06 43 35 CC Roger. Thank you.
00 06 44 37 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 06 44 40 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 06 44 41 CC Okay, Apollo 8. I'd like to fill you in
 on things we're thinking about doing in the
 next couple of hours, first chance you get
 there.
00 06 44 51 CDR Go ahead.

Tape 7
Page 5
00 06 44 52 CC Okay. In relationship to the midcourse correction,
 we'd like to put that one off until
 about 11 hours, and it will be approximately
 a 25-foot-per-second burn. The reason we're
 delaying the burn time is to allow for better
 tracking as a result of the 7-1/2-foot per
 second you put in on the separation. We'd
 like to take a little more time to look at
 the tracking data. And the dispersions in your
 correction aren't going to be growing very fast
 here. What we'll do then is to delete the NAV
 sightings that occur about 09 plus 10 in the
 flight plan, and this will be getting us back
 on to the normal flight plan sequence. So
 we'll go ahead and finish the P23, and the
 7-hour limit on that P23 is due to the range
 limits on this test. Over.
00 06 45 46 CMP Is due to the what did you say?
00 06 45 47 CC The 7 hours on the P23 problem is due to the
 feet that we want to get these sightings in
 at a certain range. Over.
00 06 45 56 CMP Roger. Understand.
00 06 45 59 CC If you have any comments on that proposal, why,
 go ahead and pass them down, and we'll feed them
 in.
00 06 46 06 CDR No, I think that's fine. We need to get out of
 the suits and get something to eat here too.

Tape 7
Page 6
00 06 46 11 CC Roger. Looks like we'll be back on the flight
 plan by 11 hours. We'll be holding up on the
 updates and PAD's because of the later burn.
00 06 47 35 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 06 47 37 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
00 06 47 40 CMP Roger. I believe we have the S-IVB in sight.
 It would appear to be tumbling, and every once
 in a while, we are getting very bright reflections
 from it off the star, off the sun.
00 06 47 51 CC Roger.
00 06 50 00 CMP Houston, 8. Are you getting the data from the
 P23?
00 06 50 08 CC Stand by one.
00 06 50 12 CC Affirmative, Apollo 8.
00 06 50 13 CDR Okay.
00 07 00 13 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 07 00 15 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 07 00 18 CC Roger. We're copying your P23 progress. FAO
 advises that it looks like you are finishing
 your first star, and we'll need one more set
 on the second star, and this 7-hour cut-off
 isn't that firm, so we would like for you
 to go ahead and complete the second star if
 you can.
00 07 00 39 CDR We're on the last setting of the second star
 right now.

Tape 7
Page 7
00 07 00 41 CC Okay. Real fine. And we've got a - it's about
 time for a cryo fan cycle.
00 07 00 51 CDR Okay. We'll do them one at the time for about
 4 minutes on each of them.
00 07 00 59 CC Roger.
00 07 01 50 LMP We've got the cryo fan on in H<sub>2</sub> tank number 1.
00 07 01 57 CC Roger, Bill.
00 07 02 03 CMP Houston, Apollo 8. We've just got finished
 taking two sets, six sightings on Sirius, and
 one set on Procyon.
00 07 02 17 CC Roger. I understand that's six on Sirius and
 one on Procyon.
00 07 02 23 CMP Two sets on Sirius, one set on Procyon.
00 07 02 25 CC Roger.
00 07 02 37 CDR And we're maneuvering now to PTC attitude.
00 07 02 46 CC Oh. Roger, Apollo 8.
00 07 03 26 CC Apollo 8, when you get a chance down in the
 lower equipment bay, it looks like you're
 using the floodlights in the dim 2 position,
 and that one is a time-limited item. We would
 like for you to do your standard running in the
 dim 1 position. Over.
00 07 03 44 CDR Roger. Just turned them off.
00 07 03 47 CC Okay. Anytime you have them on, running dim 1
 position is preferred to the LEB.
00 07 03 52 CDR Thank you.

Tape 7
Page 8
00 07 04 39 LMP Houston. We have the cryo fan on - the number
 1 H<sub>2</sub> tank was on at 07:01. You can give
 us a hack when you want it - when you're ready
 for it to be turned off.
00 07 04 50 CC Wilco.
00 07 04 57 CC Okay, Apollo 8. You can terminate that one
 and go to the other tank.
00 07 05 01 LMP Roger.
00 07 05 10 LMP Okay. O<sub>2</sub> gage number 2 is on.
00 07 05 14 CC Roger.
00 07 06 21 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 07 06 22 CC Go ahead.
00 07 06 23 CMP Are you having any problem on the ground with
 your COMM?
00 07 06 27 CC Negative. You're coming in loud and clear.
00 07 06 30 CMP Okay. We seem to be breaking lock intermittently
 up here once in a while.
00 07 06 35 CC Roger. We'll keep our eye on it. It sounds
 good, though.
00 07 08 46 CMP Okay. Houston, Apollo 8. We've initiated the
 PTC.
00 07 08 51 CC Roger.
00 07 09 32 CC Okay. Apollo 8,you can terminate the fans
 in the hydrogen, and we're ready to start on
 the oxygen tanks.
00 07 09 41 CMP Okay. Stand by.

Tape 7
Page 9
00 07 11 59 CC Apollo 8, we are through with the dump; you
 can have the tape recorder back.
00 07 12 02 CMP Roger. Thank you.
00 07 15 10 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We are ready to go to the
 second O<sub>2</sub> tank.
00 07 15 15 CMP Okay.
00 07 15 19 CC And for your information, it's Cleveland
 24 to 10, and what we plan to do --
00 07 15 27 CMP Say again.
00 07 15 30 CC That's Cleveland 24 to 10, not over yet.
00 07 15 42 CDR Thank you.
00 07 20 49 CC Okay, Apollo 8. Looks like you can terminate
 your cryo fans now, and we're going to leave
 you alone for a while and let you get caught
 up. Things we have onboard, the high-gain
 antenna check, COMM mode check that you have
 listed at 7 hours, we'll put off and do whenever
 you are ready for it. So that's at your
 convenience. During the high-gain dump that
 we performed using a wide band, we were still
 getting real good data at 36K, which is a
 little bit further than circuit margins that
 were predicted for you. And we've got our
 SPS burn coming up somewhere around 11 hours,
 and we'll give you more information on that
 later.

Tape 7
Page 10
00 07 21 31 LMP Roger. We're doing the PROGRAM 21 now, determining
 ground track for LOI that we did not
 make at 5 hours.
00 07 21 44 CC Roger. Thank you.
00 07 27 20 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 07 27 21 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
00 07 27 22 CDR Okay. We just broke lock on S-band high-gain.
 We're on OMNI B now.
00 07 27 29 CC Roger. OMNI B.
00 07 27 36 CC Apollo 8, Is that Bravo or Delta?
00 07 27 40 CDR Dog, Delta.
00 07 27 41 CC Roger.
00 07 27 43 CDR We can't get the PROGRAM 21 to integrate up
 to LOI; just stalled out around 69 hours and
 2 minutes.
00 07 28 02 CC Roger. They are watching it.
00 07 28 35 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 07 28 38 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
00 07 28 41 CDR Roger. Do you want us to stop the integration
 via VERB 96? Over.
00 07 28 54 CC That is affirmative; VERB 96.
00 07 28 57 CDR Roger. Will do.

00 07 56 51 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8.
00 07 56 54 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 07 56 55 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
00 07 56 58 CDR Roger. Do you want us to hold off on this P52
 realignment, also?
00 07 57 04 SC Yes, that is affirmative, CAP COM. We want to
 do that a couple of hours when it is related
 to the maneuver, midcourse.
00 07 57 10 CC That is affirmative, Apollo 8. Let's time the
 maneuver and we will hold off and do that all
 in normal premaneuver sequence. And - We have
 got a score here - in the fourth quarter, 31 to
 13. And I've got some words on your P21 discrepancy
 any time you are interested. And I'd
 like to confirm - -
00 07 57 30 CDR Go ahead.
00 07 57 33 CC Okay. Before I get off on that one, I'd like to
 confirm that you used the VERB 37 procedure to go
 to P00.
00 07 57 41 CDR Roger.
00 07 57 43 CC Okay. On P21, the thinking runs that you had a
 slight error in your state vector at the time you
 started, and when that was integrated out, it
 intercepted the lunar surface where it locked up
 and this is contained in a fairly recent program
 note.

Tape 8
Page 2
00 07 58 06 CDR Okay.  Now, we've closed the - the waste vent,
 so we should see this O<sub>2</sub> come down now.
00 07 58 15 CC Okay. Understand you closed the waste vent,
 and how about the lithium change? Have you done
 that one?
00 07 58 23 CDR Roger. That's done.
00 07 58 24 CC Okay. Thank you.
00 07 58 30 F EECOM, FLIGHT. Did you copy that?
00 07 58 33 CMP This conference communication is great. We
 won't have to have any debriefing.
00 07 58 37 CC (Laughter) That's pretty outstanding.
00 07 58 38 CT Right.
00 07 58 43 CC Did you copy that?
00 08 13 39 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 08 13 42 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
00 08 13 44 CDR Roger. With the delay in burn, do you mind if
 we have a urine dump the - before the burn?
 Will that foul your tracking up?
00 08 13 52 CC Okay. Stand by. Let me run that one by.
00 08 14 53 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We don't have any objections
 to going ahead with the urine dump now. And for
 your information, the waste water dump - our
 schedule, we plan to put it off until about
 11:30, and this will get you up to approximately
 90 percent in your waste tank. It's a little
 higher than normal, but we wanted to put this

Tape 8
Page 3
 off until after the burn was completed; and
 some of the other things that we've got coming
 up, about 9 hours you have oxygen fuel cell purge;
 and we've already mentioned the deletion of the
 star landmark sightings. From 10 to 11 we have
 put aside for the burn preparations. And a final
 score is 31 to 20.
00 08 15 40 CDR Cleveland won over Dallas, huh?
00 08 15 43 CC How about that?
00 08 15 49 CDR Houston, how do the circuit margins on the
 S-band look as compared to your preflight calculations?
00 08 16 35 CC Okay, Apollo 8. It's a little bit early to give
 you any real numbers on your COMM performance.
 Looks like it's working as good as predicted, and
 everything else seems to be doing better, so
 this may be doing better, too, after we have done
 our next COMM checks some of these other things
 will have a better hack on; I can give you a
 quantitative answer to your question.
00 08 16 56 CDR Roger.
00 08 24 23 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
00 08 24 26 CC Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
00 08 24 29 LMP Roger. Sure got a nice view of the earth from
 here. We can see Baja California and about where
 San Diego ought to be.

Tape 8
Page 4
00 08 24 40 CC Very good.
00 08 24 44 LMP I can't see my dad's flagpole out there today,
 though.
00 08 24 48 CC We'll tell the doctors about that.
00 08 48 40 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 08 48 43 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
00 08 48 45 CC Okay. We dropped off of high gain on the OMNI
 there for a bit and went to a low bit rate, and
 we're getting ready to command you back to a
 high bit rate. Do you want us to keep you posted
 every time we change tape speeds?
00 08 49 05 CDR We're not recording now anyway, Houston.
00 08 49 08 CC Roger. Understand; but when we go to high bit
 rate, do you want to be kept informed every time
 we transfer? We hadn't planned on it.
00 08 49 20 CMP If we think it we need the recorder, we'll ask you
 on that deal.
00 08 49 24 CC Okay.
00 09 09 34 CDR Apollo 8.
00 09 09 37 CC Go ahead.
00 09 09 40 CDR Roger. How does your tracking look on us?
00 09 09 44 F Fido, FLIGHT.
00 09 10 13 CC Apollo 8, tracking still in progress and a
 little too soon to give you a firm answer on the
 results, but everything looks nominal so far.
00 09 10 26 LMP Is it working okay?

Tape 8
Page 5
00 09 10 28 CC Seems to be.
00 09 12 05 CC Apollo 8.
00 09 12 07 LMP Go ahead.
00 09 12 09 CC Okay. Sometime when it's convenient for you
 now, I would like to see an oxygen fuel cell
 purge. And do you have any estimate on when
 you might be getting around to this COMM test?
00 09 12 24 LMP Right now we're right in the middle of trying to
 get something to eat, Ken. We can - I guess we
 can do the fuel cell purge.
00 09 12 36 CC Apollo 8, there's no rush. Just didn't know
 what you were doing at the time and - Give us
 a call when you have a free moment; we'll pick
 up.
00 09 12 50 LMP We can start the O<sub>2</sub> purge now, if you wish.
00 09 12 57 CC Okay. That'd be fine, and I'll keep track of
 the time for you.
00 09 13 00 LMP Okay. That'd be good. Now I'll turn on O<sub>2</sub> now
 on fuel cell 1.
00 09 13 05 CC Okay. Thank you.
00 09 15 41 CC Apollo 8, Houston. That's about 2 minutes on your
 first fuel cell.
00 09 15 47 CDR Roger. It's up, and number 2 is on now.
00 09 15 50 CC Roger.
00 09 17 31 CMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 09 17 33 CC Houston. Go ahead.

Tape 8
Page 6
00 09 17 35 CMP While I'm waiting for my turn at the water gun,
 I might give some comments on the optics. There
 seems to be quite a band of light that goes all
 way across the scanning telescope anywhere in the
 vicinity of the sun. Just a little while ago we
 were in the position where I could pick up the
 moon in the scanning telescope. And then I looked
 at it in the sextant and the sky - the space around
 the moon was a very light blue, just about as
 light blue as we have it back on earth. And
 it's not black - that sun angle with the moon.
00 09 18 20 CC Understand. This light blue was - showed up in
 the sextant.
00 09 18 25 CMP That's affirmative. I maneuvered the optics so
 I could pick up the moon in the sextant, and the -
 the space around the moon is light blue.
00 09 18 37 CC Roger. Can you make any kind of estimate about
 the proportion of the radius, how far out that
 seems to extend?
00 09 18 46 CMP Well, it extends the full length of the sextant.
 Actually, I could see us coming as we moved across,
 because the band of light in the scanning telescope
 cut across where the moon was, and it moved
 in this area. I believe it's caused by the refractional
 light inside the optics themselves.
00 09 19 05 CC Roger.

Tape 8
Page 7
00 09 19 09 CMP Also, I've been occasionally looking out to
 see if I could see stars at various sun angles,
 and at this particular altitude, it's very difficult.
 In the scanning telescope the sun is
 very bright and the earth is very bright, And
 if I looked at the earth and try to look for stars,
 I lose my dark adaptation very quickly.
00 09 19 35 CC Roger. Do you have any problems seeing the moon?
00 09 19 41 CMP No problem seeing the moon. When I looked for the
 star landmark line of sight, I - It's a very thin
 crescent, but it was very visible.
00 09 19 53 CC Roger. Does the area illuminated in earthshine
 show up?
00 09 20 00 CMP Not at this altitude, and that's strange. I
 thought I could see that. At this altitude, the
 refraction of the light in the optics themselves,
 due to the reflection of the sunlight I suspect,
 or earth's light, completely blanked out the dark
 side of the moon to this altitude.
00 09 20 17 CC How about that.
00 09 20 23 CDR Maybe we have an atmosphere around the moon.
00 09 21 11 CC Okay, Apollo 8. Looks like that ought to terminate
 the fuel cell purging.
00 09 21 16 LMP Roger.
END OF TAPE

Tape 9
Page 1
00 09 44 40 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 09 44 45 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8.
00 09 44 47 CDR Do you want to get started here around 10 hours?
 Is that what you said?
00 09 44 54 CC Well, what we had planned was to use the 10- to
 11-hour period as your preburn preparation just
 as we would have done normally, and - -
00 09 45 04 CDR That's fine. We can go ahead and do that.
00 09 45 13 CC - - and if you can work in this COMM check
 before that, it would be desirable, but that's
 not a constraint.
00 09 45 20 CDR What do you want in the way of a COMM check,
 George?
00 09 45 27 CDR Again, what do you want?
00 09 45 29 CC Okay. What we've got here is a couple of DTO
 COMM checks. We'll be switching around to five
 different modes, and only one of them will
 interrupt your activities. In that case, we'll
 be switching to the uplink backup voice, and
 that's the one time that you might lose temporary
 uplink voice COMM. You'll have downlink voice
 COMM throughout the entire procedure, and it ought
 to take you, I guess, 10 to 15 minutes MAX, the
 only requirement being that we should stay on a
 high-gain antenna.
00 09 46 05 CDR Why don't we go ahead and start now then?

Tape 9
Page 2
00 09 46 07 CC Okay. That sounds pretty good.
00 09 46 08 CDR - whenever -
00 09 47 20 CC Okay, Apollo 8. Another couple of minutes
 and we'll be ready to go into our - our COMM
 check. And, for your information, looks like
 the signal strength is 3 to 4 dB better than
 expected on the wide range, on the WIDE BEAM
 mode, and approximately that gives you 1.4 increase
 in your range.
00 09 47 46 CDR Roger. Let's not increase it by 1.4 more,
 though.
00 09 47 50 CC Okay.
00 09 48 08 CC Something else you might take a look at: as
 you go through the PTC, we have some who would
 like to know if you can see any detectable
 effect on the windows in the form of their
 fogging. Particularly, does the sun seem to
 vary fog intensity or does it increase it or
 decrease it or make it go in patches or anything
 like that that you might be able to notice?
00 09 48 40 CDR The sun doesn't seem to change it much; however,
 the different incidences of the sun's rays
 magnify the - the fogging, or at least change it.
00 09 49 04 CC Okay, Apollo 8. I'm sorry. Would you say again,
 please?
00 09 49 08 CDR The sun doesn't stem to have any effect on the
 windows themselves, but the different inci -

Tape 9
Page 3
 angles of incidence of the sun rays change the
 relative amount of obscuration caused by the
 fogging.
00 09 49 24 CC Okay.
00 09 50 05 CC Okay, Apollo 8. We're ready to go into the
 COMM check now, and it's your option. We can
 call out switches and let you position them,
 or we can command it from the ground. In either
 event, there will be a couple of switches that
 you'll have to throw for us.
00 09 50 24 CDR We'll have to command them, and we'll throw
 what we have - what you want.
00 09 50 29 CC Okay. And I'll keep you posted on what we're
 doing. The first test is an uplink voice and
 ranging with full downlink which is essentially
 what you're doing right now, is to be used for
 a baseline.
00 09 50 44 CDR Roger.
00 09 51 12 CC Okay. We're starting on test number 1, and
 if you would verify that S-band NORMAL mode
 switch is in VOICE.
00 09 51 22 CDR Roger. We're in VOICE.
00 09 51 24 CC Okay.
00 09 51 25 CDR ... Charlie.
00 09 51 31 CC And the up-telemetry DATA to DATA.
00 09 51 36 CDR Roger. DATA.

Tape 9
Page 4
00 09 51 49 CC Okay. And up-telemetry COMMAND to NORMAL.
00 09 51 55 CDR Normal.
00 09 51 57 CC Roger. How about high-gain antenna track to
 AUTO?
00 09 52 01 CDR We're on OMNI D now; we've got to wait till we
 get around the other way.
00 09 52 10 CC Okay. What's your estimate?
00 09 52 19 CDR We're at 15 minutes from it.
00 09 52 25 CC Okay.
00 09 52 34 CDR Maybe we'd better hold the COMM check till after
 the midcourse, because we'd better get fired
 here at 10 if we want to burn at 9.
00 09 52 43 CC That's affirm. We're viewing that right now.
00 09 52 47 CDR ... means we're on two vertical level.
00 09 52 55 CC Okay, Apollo 8. We're postponing the COMM test
 until after the burn.
00 09 53 02 CDR Thank you.
00 09 54 20 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. Are you ready to go - for
 us to go through with the P52 now?
00 09 54 35 CC That's negative, Apollo 8. We would like to update
 things first, and we're going to give you a LM
 state vector and then an external DELTA-V.
00 09 54 43 CDR Roger.
00 09 54 44 CC And with P00 in ACCEPT while we'll go ahead and
 work on that.
00 09 54 50 CDR Roger.

Tape 9
Page 5
00 09 57 18 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 09 57 20 CDR Go ahead.
00 09 57 22 CC Okay. We've got your PAD's. We're ready to
 read up to you, And we're standing by to uplink
 your state vector and external DELTA-V whenever
 you're ready to give us ACCEPT.
00 09 57 36 CDR Roger. Just stand by one, and we will get the
 PAD from you.
00 09 57 48 CDR And we will put in - TM in ACCEPT now - at this
 time.
00 09 57 53 CC Roger.
00 09 58 10 CDR We're ready to copy the PAD.
00 09 58 21 CC Okay, Apollo 8. I didn't copy that last one.
 We are sending you state vector up now.
00 09 58 26 CDR Roger. We say we are ready to copy the PAD.
00 09 58 29 CC Okay. The first PAD will be a maneuver PAD,
 MCC 1, and this will be an SPS/G&N beginning
 with the weight, 63295 minus 163 plus 129 010
 59 58 30 plus 001 36 minus 00 045 plus 002 02

 a TLI plus - 11 PAD for you.
00 10 03 02 CDR Roger. Go ahead.
00 10 03 16 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. Go ahead.
00 10 03 18 CC Roger, Apollo 8. Loud and clear now. Are you
 ready to copy?
00 10 03 23 CDR Roger. Ready to copy.
00 10 03 24 CC Okay. This is a TLI plus 11, SPS/G&R. This
 assumes a midcourse correction number 1: 631

 The hour's 013. Range to go EMS.
00 10 08 57 CDR 013.
00 10 09 00 CC Roger. Copy that and the rings to go in the
 EMS 126 83. Over.
00 10 09 11 CDR 12683.
00 10 09 13 CC That's correct.
00 10 09 16 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8. Be advised that we
 doubted that it would be possible to use the
 stars to get our backup alignment. We haven't
 been able to see any stars through the scanning
 telescope yet.
00 10 09 30 CC Roger.
00 10 09 40 CC Okay. And another comment for you, Apollo 8;
 like for you to use VERB 37 to select P00 and

Tape 9
Page 8
 then wait for your computer activity light to
 go off prior to unzap of the LM NAV to CSM SLA.
00 10 09 55 CDR Roger. You ready for us to do that now?
00 10 10 00 CC That's affirm.
00 10 11 00 CDR Houston, this is Apollo 8.
00 10 11 03 CC Go ahead.
00 10 11 05 CDR Okay. Now we'll go ahead and start back towards
 the flight plan around 8 hours here of P52, right?
00 10 11 14 CC That's affirm.
00 10 11 19 CDR Well, we - we have transferred - wait - we've
 transferred the state vector to the LM SLA
 already before we did a 52. So we're going to
 do the 52 now.
00 10 11 43 CC Okay, Apollo 8. That's good procedure and -
00 10 16 13 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 10 16 16 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
00 10 16 18 CC Roger. Will you check your up-telemetry switch
 to BLOCK, please?
00 10 16 24 CDR Thank you. It's in BLOCK.
00 10 29 24 CC Apollo 8,Houston.
00 10 29 27 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 10 29 30 CC Okay. We've got a telescope alignment if you'd
 like to give it a try. Your sextant star is
 still good, but if you had problems with that,
 folks have worked out that if you look through
 the telescope at 10:35, we have a shaft and

Tape 9
Page 9
 trunnion that should point you at the center
 of the earth, if you would like to give that one
 a try.
00 10 29 52 CDR Okay.
00 10 29 55 CC Okay. At 10:35, the shaft angle 006.2, trunnion
 18.9. Over.
00 10 30 15 CDR Roger. 10:35: shaft 006.2, trunnion 18.9.
00 10 30 20 CC That's affirmative.
00 10 32 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 10 32 32 CDR Go ahead.
00 10 32 34 CC Okay. We'd like to get a fan - a cryo fan cycle
 in here before the burn. About 1 minute on each
 should be fine.
00 10 32 44 LMP Roger. I've already given 2 minutes on H<sub>2</sub> 1
 and 2 and O<sub>2</sub> 1, and I've just started O<sub>2</sub> 2.
00 10 32 52 CC Roger. Thank you.
00 10 34 17 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to dump your tape
 prior to the burn.
00 10 34 26 LMP Roger. It's only been running here about 15 minutes.
00 10 34 43 CC Okay, Apollo 8. That's - that's correct. You're
 on high bit rate, and we're afraid you may run
 out before the burn, so we'd like to dump it,
 and give it back to you with a full load before
 the burn.
00 10 35 00 LMP Roger. And give us a comment on the voice quality.
00 10 35 04 CC Wilco.

00 10 36 49 LMP Houston, Apollo 8.
00 10 36 51 CC Go ahead.
00 10 36 54 LMP Roger. We plan to stop charging battery B
 about another 5 minutes. You concur?
00 10 37 05 CC That's affirmative.
00 10 37 07 LMP Okay. You might just remind us.
00 10 37 10 CC Wilco.
00 10 43 08 CC Apollo 8.
00 10 43 12 CDR This is 8. Go ahead.
00 10 43 20 CC Go ahead, Houston. You were cut out.
00 10 43 22 CC Okay, Apollo 8. All your systems are GO, and
 we were about to tell you you can go ahead and
 terminate the battery charge, and you beat us to
 the punch.
00 10 43 35 CDR I read your mind, and it's showing 37 volts right
 now.
00 10 43 40 CC Okay.
00 10 53 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston. If you'll go high bit rate,
 we'll give you a tape recorder back to your
 command.
00 10 54 43 CC Apollo 8, Houston. If you'll put your high bit
 rate on, we'll give you a tape recorder back.
00 10 54 49 CDR Roger.
00 10 56 50 CDR Houston, did you give us a tape back? Over.
00 10 57 06 CC Affirmative, Apollo 8.
00 10 57 09 CDR Apollo 8's COMMAND RESET to get tape motion,
 we're now in NORMAL.

00 10 57 20 CC Roger.
00 10 58 42 CC Apollo 8, stand by for a mark at 1 minute.
00 10 58 48 CDR Roger. Apollo 8 standing by.
00 10 58 49 CC Ten seconds.
00 10 58 54 CC Five seconds.
00 10 58 57 CC 2, 1 -
00 10 58 59 CC MARK.
00 10 59 00 CC One minute.
00 10 59 01 CDR Roger.
00 11 02 43 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 11 02 45 CC Go ahead.
00 11 02 48 CDR Roger. The burn time was on time - about
 2 seconds; we have residual 4.4 X. We burned
 it out to 0.2. Attitudes are nominal. The
 DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> before the residuals were taken out
 was a minus 2.4. I have transferred the state
 vector to the LM's slot in VERB 66.
00 11 03 14 CC Roger. Copy 4.4 for X and 2.4 on Z. And negative
 residual on Y prior to the trim. Is that
 affirm?
00 11 03 24 CDR That's affirmative, and we took out the 4.4 residual
 down to 0.2.
00 11 03 29 CC Roger.
00 11 04 13 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Do you want us to start
 charging battery A, now?
00 11 04 20 CC Standby.

Tape 9
Page 12
00 11 04 35 CC Apollo 8. Let's go back to battery Bravo, and
 we'll finish that one off before we start in on
 Alfa.
00 11 04 43 LMP Roger. Battery Bravo.
00 11 04 52 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. Do you want us to maneuver
 to any particular attitude for a water dump, or
 do you want us to go to PTC attitude?
00 11 05 02 CC Okay. Let's go PTC.
00 11 05 04 CDR And give us the angles, please.
END OF TAPE

Tape 10
Page 1
-- -- -- -- CC Okay, Apollo 8. Let's do the same angles
 we had before: that's pitch 242 and yaw 20
 on the PTC attitude.
00 11 05 40 CMP 242, yaw 20. Roger.
00 11 07 50 CMP Houston, we're preparing to dump our waste
 water now.
00 11 07 54 CC Roger.
00 11 10 41 CDR Houston, Apollo 8.
00 11 10 44 CC Go ahead, 8.
00 11 10 47 CDR We noticed on our system test battery vent
 pressure that when we opened the battery vent
 valve, we get an immediate drop-off to pressure
 which nulls out at about two-tenths of 2 - to
 three-tenths of a volt. And we think this is
 zero at the battery manifold. Do you concur?
00 11 11 08 CC Okay. Stand by. ... stand by one, and let's
 check it out.
00 11 11 17 CC Apollo 8, I cut you out there. What did you say
 on the last one?
00 11 11 22 CDR It looks like probably that zero psi corresponds
 to about three-tenths of a volt on the test meter.
 We've had it happen a couple of times, where
 the pressure would drop rapidly to this setting,
 as if it were zero. Over.
00 11 11 37 CC Roger. We'll look at our data here and let you
 know what we see. Are you going ahead with the
 water dump now?

Tape 10
Page 2
00 11 11 49 CDR Roger. We'd - we're pausing here on the water
 dump, though, just to verify that the battery
 vent - the line is clear as indicated by a
 battery vent pressure of zero.
00 11 12 03 CC Okay. Stand by.
00 11 20 10 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 11 20 13 CDR Go ahead, Houston.
00 11 20 15 CC Okay. Number one on the list of things is that
 the flight plan shows CDR should hit the sack.
 Number two, kind of a summary of your burn. All
 your SPS and systems look GO. The trajectory
 shows that you have a CPA with a mode of 69.67 miles
 and the time of pericynthion is 69 plus 10. You
 do have a capture on a good free return. It's
 a little bit early to completely evaluate the
 trajectory for corridor control. You'll have no
 update to the TLI plus 11 block data. After looking
 through the CAL curves, it looks like the battery-vent
 pressure is actually zero at 0.2 to 0.3 volts,
 so that - we agree with you there, and you can go
 ahead with the water dump. We still have the
 COMM check to do whenever we get ourselves in a
 good high gain look angle and whenever it's convenient
 for you. Over.
00 11 21 26 CDR Thank you very much. That was a very fine resume
 you sent in. We're right now in the process of

Tape 10
Page 3
 trying to dump out the water and the UCDA's and
 so on and so on. So we'll get with you on the
 high gain as soon as we can.
00 11 21 41 CC Okay. Good burn.
00 11 21 44 CDR Houston, what do you want to dump the waste tank
 down to?
00 11 22 01 CC Apollo 8, I would like you to dump the waste tank
 to 25 percent.
00 11 22 08 CDR Copy.
00 11 27 07 LMP Hey, we're dumping now, Houston.
00 11 27 09 CC Okay. Thank you.
00 11 27 12 LMP We finally got some stare to see.
00 11 32 00 CC Apollo 8, Houston.
00 11 32 03 CDR Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
00 11 32 05 CC Roger. Do you folks have your WATER QUANTITY
 switch in the POTABLE or the WASTE WATER TANK
 position now?
00 11 32 14 CDR We're in the WASTE TANK position now, and we're
 dumping UCDA's first, Houston.
00 11 32 20 CC Okay. We weren't watching any waste quantity
 decrease, and it looked like the nozzle temps
 indicated that something was going on, and we
 were trying to dope out what was going on.
00 11 32 30 CDR Well, there's a lot of stuff going out I'll tell
 you. How do nozzle temps look?

Tape 10
Page 4
00 11 32 41 CC Oh, about 81.
00 11 32 44 CDR Okay. We'll keep on going then.
00 11 40 37 LMP Okay, Houston. We're going to dump the waste
 tank on down to about 25 percent.
00 11 40 44 CC Okay. Thank you.
00 11 40 57 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Do you copy?
00 11 40 59 CC Affirmative, Apollo 8.
00 11 41 02 LMP Okay. Tell Zeke Thomas to wake up and keep an
 eye on the waste tank servicing.
00 11 41 16 CC It'll take a minute to think of something appropriate.
00 11 41 23 LMP You're slowing down.
00 11 41 28 CC So are you guys.
00 11 46 53 LMP How are the nozzle temperatures looking, Houston?
00 11 46 59 CC Stand by.
00 11 49 16 LMP Man, you're looking pretty small down there now,
 Houston.
00 11 49 24 CC We're carrying a big stick, though.
00 11 49 30 LMP Just barely make out Clear Lake.
00 11 49 40 CC Your nozzle temperatures have dropped from about
 94 to around 66.
00 11 49 49 LMP Okay. I'm showing just a little bit above 50 percent
 here, and we'll keep on going, and if it looks
 too cold, give us a call.
00 11 49 59 CC Okay. We'll do that.

Tape 10
Page 5
00 11 50 30 LMP Houston, we had a momentary O<sub>2</sub> high flow, but
 we think it's due to all the purging of the water
 lines we're doing here in the cabin.
00 11 50 40 CC Roger. We concur.
00 11 53 20 CC Apollo 8, Houston. We show you down to 25 percent
 of your waste water.
00 11 53 26 LMP Okay. I'm just about 28, Houston. Stand by just
 a bit.
00 11 54 02 LMP Okay. Waste dump stopped and then purge again.
00 11 54 05 CC Understand. Roger. Waste dump stopped.
00 11 54 08 LMP Roger.
00 11 59 50 LMP Houston, we're on a high gain, and it might be
 a good time to try your COMM check.
00 12 00 59 CC Apollo 8, we're going to go ahead and crank up
 to a COMM test now, and we will be a little bit
 late on your update for 12 hours.
00 12 01 10 LMP Okay.
00 12 01 11 CC Do you still want our - have us command as much
 as we can on the ground, or would you like to move
 the switches yourself7
00 12 01 20 LMP Oh, you can have the fun of doing it.
00 12 01 23 CC Sounds like you're dragging there.
00 12 01 30 LMP ... you suggest a ... We're using 1/250 on at
 f:11 on CEX and CMAX for earth shots. Do you
 verify? Over.
00 12 01 43 CC Okay. You got going before I got my pencil up.
 How about saying it again?

Tape 10
Page 6
00 12 01 49 LMP f:11 and 1/250 for CEX 16mm and C 70mm.
00 12 01 58 CC Okay. Thank you.
00 12 02 01 LMP How about running in by the back room boys. My
 light meter doesn't seem to be helping out too
 much.
00 12 02 07 CC Okay.
00 12 03 01 CC Okay, Apollo 8. We're starting in - setting up
 for our first COMM test. This is going to be an
 uplink voice, ranging, and full downlink, which
 is not anything really different than what you
 have on board. I would like for you to verify
 that the S-band NORMAL MODE VOICE switch is in
 VOICE.
00 12 03 22 LMP Roger. VOICE.
00 12 03 24 CC Okay. And the up-telemetry DATA to DATA.
00 12 03 28 LMP Roger. DATA.
00 12 03 33 CC Up-telemetry COMMAND in NORMAL.
00 12 03 36 LMP Roger. NORMAL.
00 12 03 38 CC High-gain antenna to AUTO TRACK.
00 12 03 42 CC Correction. That's -
00 12 03 43 LMP AUTO.
00 12 03 46 LMP We're in AUTO WIDE BEAM, and you can go ahead and
 dump the tape.
00 12 03 50 CC Okay. I'd like for you to go to NARROW BEAM.
00 12 03 54 LMP Okay. Going to NARROW BEAM now.
00 12 03 57 CC Roger.

Tape 10
Page 7
00 12 04 01 CC And I'll give you a call when we get ready to
 work on the tape.
00 12 04 05 LMP Okay. We're still in PTC, so you're only going
 to have it for about 10 or 15 minutes.
00 12 04 12 CC Okay. We've had some problems with our displays,
 and I think they're straightened out now, but
 you may have to keep us advised if we run out of
 limits in case we display again.
00 12 04 22 LMP Roger.
00 12 04 38 CC Say, while we're standing by here, Apollo 8,
 the service module quantities that we had listed -
 we're going to try to update them, if you want
 to call out your quantities. Have you checked them
 with your charts?
00 12 04 54 LMP Negative. I haven't gotten around to that. Stand
 by.
00 12 04 56 CC Okay. There's no hurry on that. Just wondered
 if you had done it; we will check it against what
 we've got on our nomogram.
00 12 05 17 LMP I'm showing a SPS helium pressure, about 3570,
 indicated on board.
00 12 05 29 CC Roger.
00 12 05 31 LMP And fuel LOX tank pressures are 177 and 176,
 respectively.
00 12 05 40 CC Okay.
00 12 05 44 LMP N<sub>2</sub> A is 2400, B 2500.
00 12 05 52 CC Okay.

Tape 10
Page 8
00 12 06 12 CC Okay. And our back room tells you that you've
 got the right F stop.
00 12 06 19 LMP Okay. Then we'll keep using it.
00 12 06 27 LMP This PTC attitude really isn't the greatest for
 taking pictures of the earth.
00 12 06 32 CC Roger.
00 12 06 34 LMP Or of the moon.
00 12 06 46 CC Apollo 8, kinda stand by for a burst of noise
 as we change configurations on the ground. We're
 going into test 1; You'll still have up and
 downlink, and we'll be in this mode for 2 minutes,
 but you may hear some burst of noise as we change.
00 12 07 03 LMP Roger.
00 12 08 46 CC Okay, Apollo 8. We're in the middle of our first
 test, and how about giving me a voice check.
00 12 08 53 LMP Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 8. One, two,
 three, four, five, five, four, three, two, one.
 Apollo 8, out.
00 12 08 59 CC Roger. And read you loud and clear. This COMM
 is unbelievably good.
00 12 09 05 LMP Good.
00 12 10 21 CC Okay, Apollo 8. We've finished the first test,
 and we're now going to change the uplink mode
 to UPLINK COMMAND AND RANGING, and we'll be
 going without upvoice. We'll be in this mode
 for 2-1/2 minutes and will be sending a test
