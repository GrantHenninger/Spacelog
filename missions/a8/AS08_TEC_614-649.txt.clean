04 18 45 55 CC Very good. 
04 18 46 04 CDR Co in test 5: perfect again. okay. NOWI go 
to range set, 
04 18 46 34 CC Okay. 
04 18 46 39 CDR In STANDBY. 
04 18 46 43 CC Okay. 
04 18 46 45 CDR Okay. That was perfect. 
04 18 46 47 CC Real fine. 
04 18 47 02 CC Okay, Apollo 8. I'd like to run one more null 
bias and looks like we will have exercised every- 
thing we can get to. 
04 18 47 13 CDR Okay. DELTA-V AUTO, all zeros. 
04 18 48 21 CDR Minus 2. 
04 18 48 24 CC Roger. Understand minus 2. Alright. Is that 
minus 2 or minus two-tenths? 
04 18 48 39 CDR Two-tenths, three-tenths now. 
04 18 48 42 CC Okay. Real good. That looks like we - - 
04 18 48 44 CDE It looks like we had a lot of noise on the cir- 
cuit for a while there, Jim. 
04 18 48 50 CC Yes, we did, too; all those electronic glitches 
I guess. 
04 18 48 59 CDR Okay. One hundred seconds. it's plus - minus 
four-tenths. 
04 18 49 02 CC Okay. Real fine. That looks like that's about 
all of the functions that'we can chsck, and 
looks like everything is just down ;he line. 

    Tape 76 
    Page 7 
04 18 49 15 CDR Roger. 
04 18 49 19 CC Okay. We still owe you confirmation that you 
can expect your high speed scroll to be the first 
pattern you come to, and I'll let you know as 
soon as they come in with an answer on it. 
04 18 49 32 CDR Cksy . 
04 18 49 32 CC I'd like to go ahead and finish going through 
the entry book if you're ready. 
04 18 49 37 CDR Roger. 
04 18 49 43 CC Okay. Ue've reviewed most of the book up here, 
and we will have to-come back and suggest a way 
that we can check out the wate: boiler prior to 
getting reentry area. We've revier..d all of the 
last minutes changes that were put in - pen and 
ink type things - and they're all looking good. 
On page E-7, like to add a couple of items. 
04 18 50 15 CDR what's that? 
04 18 50 16 CC Okay. On step 34 under final stowage, which is 
a sort of c&-h-all area, there's a steE that 
says secondary glycol to radiator that bypass 
verify. While we are do-wn in this area, we 
would like to go to panel 382, the water control 
panel, and set up the evaporator water control 
valve both primary and secondary to AUTO. Now 
this is something we would have done had we done 
the cold soak at minus 12 hours, but since we
 
    Tape 76 
    Page 8 
weren't doing it there, we would like to go 
ahead and make sure we have these in AUTO, and 
this will enable automatic controls from the 
panel. 
04 18 51 02 CDR Can we just make this part of the procedure 
when we test out the water boilers beforehand? 
04 18 51 08 CC Yes, sir. If we get that checked out earlier, 
-re can just ieave them in AUTO. 
04 18 51 13 CDR I'd rather do that. 
04 18 51 15 CC Okay. I'm just going to make a note here, and  we can do it the other way, too. The other 
item that Kas pen-and-inked in - - 
04 18 51 23 CDR ... 
04 18 51 27 CC You may already have this down as step 35. It 
says UP TELRMEIRY to BLOCK, VERIFY, and there's 
a step right after that that says RX? command 
module heaters to circuit breakers CLOSED. 
04 18 51 43 CDR Roger. 
04 18 51 48 CC Okay. 
04 18 51 49 CDR I have that. 
04 18 51 50 CC Okay. I guess that one was sent up to you this 
: afternoon. And when you LUII the Fage over to 
R-8, it shows the EMS entry check being run at { 
minus sn hour, and you know that it's a short 
t -- < test. There is really no reason to wait for an 
hour; we might as well go ahead an2 do that as 

    Tape 76 
    Page 9 
soon as you get through with step 35 on page E-7 
because we're coming up on a pretty busy period. 
04 18 52 19 CLIR I say that's fine; we'll do that. 
04 18 52 37 CDR Houston, are you still there? 
04 18 52 39 CC Roger. We got a discussion going; be right 
back. 
04 18 53 50 CC Okay, Apollo 8. On page E-9 - - 
04 18 53 57 CDR okay. 
04 18 53 58 CC - - at the top of the page, you have step 38, 
and right underneath that, prior to step 39, we 

want to have a primary glycol loop uctivation. 
- What we are doing is to get the glycol evapora- 
tor water switch to AUTO and the glycol evap- 
orator steam pressure switched to AUTO. This  will get your prinary water boiler on the line 
prior to entry, or at least it'll enable it. 
04 18 54 35 CDR Okay. Tell IIE what to write in, Ken. 
04 18 54 37 CC Okay. It's glycol 'evaporator water to AUTO. 
04 18 55 43 CC Apollo 8, iiouston. Are you there? 
04 18 55 55 CDR Clycol evaporator water switch to ALPTO. 
04 18 55 59 CC Okay. And the second switch is the glycol evap- 
orator steam pressure to AUTO. 
04 18 56 18 CDR Okay. 
04 18 56 25 CC Okay. That takes care of getting the primary 
i *.-â€™ water boiler enabled, and it's my understanding 
that we were going to make the actual entry with 

    Tape 76 
    Page 10 
both the primary and the secondary water boilers 
on the line. 
04 18 56 40 CDR I'm not reading you now, Houston. 
04 18 56 44 CC Roger. How now? 
04 18 56 48 CDR Loud and clear. 
04 18 56 49 CC Okay. There's some question from reading the 
checklist. It is my understanding that both 
the primary and the secondary water boilers will be OR for the actual entry, and don't find 
a place in the checklist where it's actually 
- turned on. So we'd like to get confirmation 
on that, and we'll make sure that we have all 
the proper switching to put in the checklist. 
04 18 57 16 CDR Okay. 
04 18 57 23 CC A.iri,$lt . Still on page E-9 and under step 39 
at the bottom of the pyro circuit check, there's 
a step that says panel 8, all circuit breakers 
CLOSED except and then it lists five that are 
printed, one that was pen-and-inked before 
launch. It says EDS power circuit breakers 3 
OPEN, and to be complete, we ought to add the 
RCS heater circuit breakers. There's two of 
those, and they should also be OPEN. 
04 18 58 06 CDR Okay. 
04 18 58 11 CC Alright. The rest of these pages look good; 
I'm coming over through the graphs. hd on 
page E-11 - - 

    Tape 76 
    Page 11 
04 18 58 48 CDR Roger. I'm with you. 
04 18 58 50 CC Okay. On step 5 on E-11, there's - the first 
. subtitle there is Relmets and Gloves, and the 
items that follow beneath that are affected by 
whether you wear suits or come in shirt sleeves, 
but they do have to be accomplished. And the 
suit return air valves would actually be OPEN 
for a shirt-sleeve entry. And you should have 
a line penciled in of optics power to OFF between 
an emergency cabin pressure valve and the time 
. when the CMP moves to.the couch. 
04 18 59 26 CDR Right. 
04.18 5928 CC Okay. And the step shows the tape recorder to 
REWIND at minus 30. Now that's an onboard step 
rather than a ground step, just to verify that. 
04 18 59 48 CDR Okay. iI 
04 18 59 50 CC Okay. Under step 6, almost at the bottom - in 
fact, it's three lines from the bottom of 
step 6 - there's a section that says secondary 
coolant loop evaporator to RESET, and should 
be a note that that's 58 seconds if you hold 
it in RESET prior to moving the pump OFF. 
04 19 00 12 CDR That's it; that's in it. 
04 19 00 15 CC Okay. Okay. The next torment is on page E-13. 
04 19 00 34 CDR Okay. I'm there. 
04 19 00 36 CC Alright. This is a general conmen'; that refers 
to any time you're working around P62 or when 

    Tape 76
you're going between ~62 and ~63, 
    Page 12 
and you should 
be careful not to call an extended VERB during ' 
this time. . This is here in the program notes, 
and it is just a reminder. What will happen 
if we get into an extended VERB such as an 83 
or an 82? We may get hung-up in ~62 2nd have 
to recycle through it in order to get the 63, 
and neither of these displays are normally 
used, and it's just a good practice. And we're 
just trying to remind you that we don't want to 
call an extended VERB while we're in P62. 
04 19 01 22 CDR Okay. Neither do we. That's right. 
04 19 01 24 CC Okay. 
04 19 01 41 CC Okay. In going through the rest of it, we 
I didn't find any other things to make comments 
on. You have all the latest corrections in 
your checklist. 
04 19 01 51 CDR Roger. The main thing, that is to come up with 
a way to determine that the boiler - water 
boiler is not dry and make sure that Bill gets 
it activated at TMS 7. 
04 19 02 03 CC 'Phst is correct, and we will talk to you some 
more about that next time we catch both you 
and Bill up. 
\ 
04 19 02 10 CDR Righto. 
04 19 06 41 CDR Ken, this is Frank. I am going to be off the 
headset for about 5 minutes here. 

    Tape 76 
    Page 13 
04 19 06 44 CC Okay. Fine. When you come back, I will have 
    a systems rundown for you. 
04 19 06 50 CDR Fine. 
04 19 17 12 CDR Houston, Apollo 8. 
04 19 17 16 CC Okay. Loud and clear. 
04 19 17 20 CDR Back with you. 
04 19 17 22 CC Okay. I've got a few good words for you. The 
erasable memory has been taken completely apart 
and looked at, and it looks like it's all okay. 
Your PO1 didn't have any effect. The one thing 
that might be questionable is if you used a 
VERB 67 when you get to the NOUN 99 display, 
you may find 
what you're going 
that one to be unreliable, 
to get there is the - that's 
and 
m. error display for the W-matrix. And it's 
something you probably won't be usjng again 
. anyhow; and if the occasion arises, we can 
update that one, but it's not a normally used 
display and everything else, all the operational 
functions, are good. 
04 19 18 17 CDR Very good. 
04 19 18 19 CC Okay. As of 114 hours , your batteries - you 
had battery A with 39.32 amp-hours, battery B had 35.21, and battery C 38.46. Your cryo 
quantities remaining at SSP were the same 
I  we gave you the last time, 18~ pounds of oxygen 
per tank and 11 pounds of hydrogen per,tank. At 

    Tape 76 
0 present, the service module RCS, using 
    Page 14 
the 
computer values for the quantities, you have 
quad A with 45 percent, Bravo with 50, Charlie 
with 58, and Delta at 48. What we plan to do 
with the secondary tanks is to go ahead and 
turn them on at 37 percent actual, and in the 
event of lost COMMor something like that, 
recommend that you.use 50 percent onboard 
gaging as being the time to turn the secondary 
propellants on. However, as long as'we can 
use our own calculations, why, we might as 
- well leave them tied up. We probably won't 
c-1 â€™ get into the seconday propellants prior to 
entry anyhow. 
04 19 19 41 CDR Roger. 
04 19 19 42 CC Okay. A couple of items I want to check up 
On: I'd like to confirm that the hatch Dog 
will be taken off while you're on the chutes 
if you can. If not, you're going to do that in 
the water. Is that affirm? 
CDR ... 
I 
CC Okay. iiow we've got a little better sign 1. 
Like to confirm that the hatch clamps on the 
I 
side hatch will be taken off either on the 
\ chutes or in the water, whichever you can get 
(..- ..I 
to. Is that affirm? 

    Tape 76 
    Page 15 
CDR Roger. That's affirm. As a matter of fact, 
we didn't even put - didn't even put them on. 
04 19 20 45 CC Okay. Do you plan to put them on for an entry? 
04 19 20 50 CDR I don't think so. If's held pretty well so 
far. I don't think - everybody tells me it 
wouldn't help much anyway. 
04 19 20 58 CC Okay. And we realize we never did find out 
what happened to the Mae West. Did you leave 
it blown up, or did you dump it? 
04 19 21 09 CDR We dumped it. 
04 19 21 12 CC Okay. Who was the lucky guy? 
04 19 21 17 OR The same gu,, that tried to launch us this after- 
noon again. 
04 19 21 23 CC Okay. And just as a gee whiz item:you're now 
a 137 915 o-t, and you've only accelerated the 
4883. You might check to make sure you don't 
have a speed brake hanging. 
04 19 21 41 CDR Dh-oh. 
04 19 21 44 CC Those are nominal values. 
04 19 21 50 CDR Roger. 137 000 miles out, huh? 
04 19 21 55 CC That's affirm. 
04 19 33 18 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. Over. 
04 19 33 20 CC Loud and clear. 
04 19 33 27 LMP Good morning, or good afternoon, or whatever 
jâ€™ it is. The JOD is back at the CON; CDR went 
.c -â€™ 
back to bed. 

    Tape 76 
04 19 33 32 CC Okay. 
    Page 16 

04 19 33 44 CC Looks like all the junior guys have the midwatch. 
04 19 33 49 Lw I know what you mean. I had a little sleep earlier, 
so I am pretty well rested and want to make sure 
Frank gets a good snooze here prior to entry. This 
might be a good time to try out your background 
music, and see if you have any better luck. 
04 19 34 16 CC Okay. We'll try that a little later. 
04 19 37 48 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 19 38 43 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 19 38 49 LMP Go ahead, Houston. 
04 19 38 51 CC Okay. I guess we should start off with a little 
dialogue about sleep. How much did you have? 
04 19 39 03 LMP Well, let's see; whenever it was I told you I went 
to bed last ni@t till now. Just a second and 
let me check the flight plan. 
04 19 40 48 LMP dave you got it logged in when it was I asked for 
that last Seconal? 
04 19 40 57 CC Okay. I guess we can figure that out for ourselves, 
can't we? 
04 19 41 02 LMP Yes. Why don't you let me know. I have.kind of 
lost track of time it was when I went to bed. But 
it was about - I went to sleep about 15 minutes after 
that and woke up about 10 minutes ago. Good sleep. 
04 19 41 12 CC Okay. So I see it is now 142 hours. 
04 19 41 27 LMP What do you think I em, 3ip van Winkle? 

    Tape 76 
    Page 17 
04 19 41 30 CC Just trying to find out how soundly you really 
slept. I guess you are not that sleepy. 
04 19 41 36 LMP . . . but not that. 
04 19 41 40 CC Okay. It's really about 4 hours, Bill. 
04 19 41 50 LMP Okay. Good. 
04 19 42 39 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Have you got somebody under 
the left couch, or could you get down to the  water control panel? 
04 19 42 49 LMP I can get dovn there. Frank hasn:t quite gone 
to sleep yet. 
04 19 42 52 CC Uell, what we were thinking about doing was boiling 
a little out of the secondary evaporator to check 
it out, just as a component check, something we 
need to do; but if there's somebody down there in 
the vay, why, we can do that some other time. 
04 19 43 17 LMP Well, if it boils, we are going to know it before - 
it won't take long to find out it won't boil. 
There's not a heck of a lot we can do about it, so 
v?ly don't we wait until someone else wakes up here, 
Frank wakes up again. How will that be? 
04 19 43 27 CC Yes. That would be fine. There is something you 
can do; you can reservice it. And it is kind of 
a tediousprocess, and that's t5e reason why we just 
want to kind of keep our eyes on it so we will have 
some idea prior to entry if we can count on having 
two loops or one. Which kind of leads us into 

    Tape 76 
    Page 18 
another question we are trying to pin down, two 
questions, in fact. Number one, we would like 
to verify that you do plan to use both primary 
and secondary boilers during the actual entry, 
end we are also looking for a way of checking the 
primary boiler to make sure it isn't dried out prior 
to entry. And that is turning into a little more 
of a challenge than you might suspect. If you 
have any thoughts on that subject, we can go over 
that. 
04 19 44 21 r&P The answer to the question is yes, we do plan to 
use both. Before we get into the water boiler 
pump though, CDR would like to take a Seconal also; 
make sure he can get off to sleep here. 
04 19 44 41 CC Okay. That's a GO. 
04 19 44 46 LMP Okay. On the water boiler: it's interesting Linat 
.I get my own - I was going to say anytime you have 
your mike keyed, I can hear myself talk with about 
a 2-second time delay. With respect to the primary 
and secondary boiler checks, I thirJc that is a good 
idea to make sure we got them both prior to entry 
and have the reservicing procedures handy. 
04 19 45 39 CC Roger, Bill. You know the secondary - well, in fact, 
both reservicing procedures are available in a 
malfunction book, and sort of the problem with check- 
ing out the primary boiler is finding a way to 
make it boil on the way in, 

    Tape 76 
    Page 19 
04 19 46 03 w Yes. Just a second, I got another little chore 
going here. 
04 19 46 39 LMP Roger. It looks like the only way we'll be able 
to do it would be to shut off the radiators. 
04 19 46 48 CC We were looking for a little more docile way to 
do that. 
04 19 46 55 LMP Roger; That way would be agreeable to me too, 
a little more docile way, but they shouldn't 
freeze up if we did it quickly. 
04 19 47 08 CC Roger. We are talking over several things, you 
know, like putting the ten-pin valve to KANUAL 
or partially closing it or some of these different 
ideas, and something you can think about whiie 
you are laying there with nothing else to do. 
04 19 47 26 LMP Yes. We noticed that it had gotten warmer in 
the cockpit coming back than it was going out. And 
I remember going out when we manually positioned 
the ten-pin valve, but we had pretty good control 
over the glycol evap outlet temperature. So possibly 
that would be the thing to attack first rather than 
the radiators. 
04 19 47 49 CC Okay. We've got the back room boys looking at it. 
04 19 47 57 LMP I guess if we do pick a time, though, we cught to 
pick a time that if something did go haywire, we 
could afford to boil . . . the rest of the way in, 
but still leave us enought time to fix - rig up the 
evap service if it didn't work. 

    Tape 76 
    Page 20 
04 19 48 12 CC That's affirm, and we're factoring in things 
like trajectory considerations and all that sort 
of thing, too. 
04 19 48 22 LMP Right. I think that the second derivative of 
the water boiler versus time plot will give us 
the optimum time to do it. 

04 19 48 45 CC EECOM's copying that. 
04 19 48 52 CC There's also speculation you have a chart on 
board that gives that information. 
04 19 49 02 LMP Well, if I don't, I'm sure those guys can ship 
    one up. They've shipped up some other pretty 
    good ones. 
04 19 49 08 CC It's also been suggested that if you don't have 
the chart it's on the tape recorder. 
04 19 49 18 LMP Well, if I don't have a chart, 1'11 put it on t.he 
tape recorder. 
04 19 49 27 LMP Okay. I think, unless you guys got some more 
comments along these lines, maybe we ought to 
give these guys a chance to get to sleep, and 
I'll recline here for a while. If you've got 
something to brief me on, veli, go ahead; but 
I'd like to keep my answers to yes's and no's 
.. and whatever else you think you really need. 
04 19 49 51 CC Okay. 
every 
Pine, 
30 minutes, 
Bill, and I'll 
just 
check with 
to make sure we still 
you like 
have 
voice contact. 

    Tape 76 
04 19 50 02 LMP Okay. I've got some log writing 
    Page 21 
to do and whatnot. 
So keep an eye on the systems and the gimbal angles, 
and we'll be all right. 
04 19 50 11 CC Okay. 
: 
04 19 52 17 rJ4P And, Ken, if your EECOM man wants to play the 
OMNI-switch game, we're on Dog - Bravo at this 
time, actually on Bravo but a$.0 configured for 
D's - correction, we are on D and also configured 
for Bravo. If you want to switch, we'll go ahead. 
04 19 52 43 CC Okay, we'll give that a try, and we are cranking 
up some Packground music for you. 
04 19 52 55 LMP Okay. 'Ihe last time they did that, it sounded 
like they were running at the wrong speed on the 
0 
tape, but we're a little closer now. Maybe it'll 
be a little better. 
04 19 53 02 CC Wouid you also believe Doppler shift? 
04 19 53 14 LI@ Might be another way to range. 
04 19 53 25 LbP PrGably it was Doppler shift; we're heading 
back out again, 
04 19 53 38 CC books like we can use your humming for backup 
ranging in case everything else fails. 
04 19 53 46 w Roger. 
04 19 54 15 CC Apollo 8, Houston. You don't need to answer 
this transmission, but doctors observe that it 
looks like your - some of your sensors may be 
: 
working loose, 'so you might just kind of push on 
them and see if they are in place. 

    Tape 76 
    Page 22 
04 19 54 56 LMP That do any good? 
04 19 55 03 CC Looks like it is one of your sternals, Bili. 
04 19 55 21 CC Apollo 8. We can't handle the OWN1 switching 
for about thirty more minutes, till we get back 
to an 85-foot disk, so you will have to watch 
the antenna store for a few more minutes. 
04 19 56 05 LMP Okay. I don't see any loose sensor - the upper, 
upper ... 
04 19 56 18 LMP Are you trying to call, Houston? 
04 19 56 21 CC No, I didn't. It sounded like you were getting 
an echo, and I checked, and I hadn't held the 
key down at the time either. 
04 19 56 27 LMP Okay. I don't see any loose sensors, but the 
    upper sternal is beginning to irritate a little 
    bit, but not badly; and possibly there is some- 
    thing going on there. 
04 19 56 43 CC Okay. And did you copy about the antenna? 
04 19 56 49 LMP They really disappoint me, but I'll keep that 
    in mind.

04 20 02 28 CC Apollo 8, Houston. I'd like to make a voice 
    check with you. 
04 20 03 01 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. 
04 20 03 32 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. 
04 20 04 13 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check.

04 20 05 46 (End music) 
04 20 05 50 CC Apcllo 8, Houston. Radio check. 
04 20 06 37 CC Apollo 8, Houston in the blind now. We're 
not receiving down-voice. We have data, and 
it appears it's probably a ground problem. 
04 20 07 12 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 20 07 17 LMP Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear. 
04 20 07 19 CC Okay. I got you that time. I take it you were 
able to copy us with the music? Is that affirm? 
04 20 07 28 LMP Ivas able to copy you all the time, Ken, but 
I cculd only hear the music when you were trying 
. to tmsmit. And I wondered if you noticed 
cycling on my suit power switch vhen you - 
vhen ~011 called me. I am hearing an echo now. 
04 20 07 47 CC Roger. I copy your echo. And what switch were . 
you cycling? 
04 20 07 57 LMP I was cycling the suit power which turns off 
the BIONZD periodically. I figured +&t would 
wake the doctors up. 

    Tape 77

04 20 08 10 It appears that we have more than one communications problem. 
04 20 08 17 Roger. 
04 20 11 25 Calm it. (Laughter) 
04 20 11 36 You are cutting out, Houston. 
04 20 11 40 Oh, that was sn inadvertent cut-in. 
04 20 11 45 Okay. 
04 20 18 34 You need the high gain, Houston, or will the 
    OMNI's be okay? 
04 20 18 50 CC 8, Houston. That's negative. The OMNI is 
    okay. 
04 20 18 56 LMP Roger. Be advised that about 50 - I am hearing 
    these echos quite a bit of the time, and if 
    you are trying to play music, I am not hearing 
    it. 
04 20 19 06 F Roger. We understand, and we are not trying 
    to play music right now. 
04 20 19 15 LMP Okay. who is this, CCFM TECH? 
04 20 19 22 F Ken is only human. This is his substitute; 
    this is Flight Director. 
04 20 19 32 LMP Oh, I didn't recognize your voice there. 
04 20 19 36 F I don't get to talk often. 
04 20 19 37 LMP Who is substituting for you now, Flight? 
04 20 19 43 F DFD. 
04 20 19 46 LMP Okay. Things are looking pretty good from 
    here. How about down there? 
04 20 19 55 F It couldn't be better.

I&P You guys are doing a great job. I really 
appreciate it. 
04 20 23 23 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Going to be handling over 
sites at 25. I will make a voice clteck with 
you when we come up on the new site, and the 
ground says thank you for your kind words. 
04 20 23 38 LMP Okay. We will be standing by. 
04 20 25 36 CC Apollo 8, Houston through Honeysuckle. 
04 20 25 42 IalP Roger, Houston. Loud and clear. 
04 20 25 43 CC Okay, Bill, and our BIOMED data still looks 
a little bit 'squirrelly. How about checking 
the blue signal conditioner on your BIOMED 
harness. You have one connector, should be 
the center package, has a blue connector on 
it. You kind of check that, and I don't 
know if you have changed the BIOMBD harness 
leads recently; if you have, this might have . 
caused our problem. 
04 20 26 18 LW Roger. I was just cracking open some acorns 
here for breakfast. Let me put them down, and 
I will check my BILKED leads. 
04 20 26 25 CC There is no rush on it. 
04 20 28 21 LMP Everything seems shipshape. 
04 20 49 26 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 20 49 58 CC Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 20 50 02 LMP Go, Houston. 

    Tape 77 
    Page 4 

04 20 50 05 CC Okay, Bill. We're ready to try this music 
c 
on a different kind,of latch-up this time. 
What I'd like to do in order to make sure 
that we maintain voice CCMMis when you get 
it if you would, give us a call and tell us 
you have the music and any comment about its 
relative volume or anything like that. And 
if I get your call, then I'll call you back 
and tell you. And what will happen is when 
I go to talk to you we'll drop the music 
link. And we can go ahead and take over the 
switching of the antennas if you like. 
04 20 50 49 LMP okay. I'm in Bravo Dog switch configuration, 
and go ahead with the music. Be advised last 
time the fidelity was low, and the volume was 
too high. 
04 20 51 02 CC Okay. And if you'll give us the same kind of 
comment, hopefully not the same comment but 
the same type of evaluation when you pick it 
up this time. 
04 20 51 15 LMP Play it a little bit, and we'll talk about it. 
04 20 51 54 (*gin music) 
04 20 52 15 Lm I can barely, barely hear it. 
04 20 53 21 J&P Needs to be just a hair louder. 
04 20 53 37 LAMP That's good. 

    Tape 77 
    Page 5 
04 20 53 49 LMP 'Ihat will keep me awake. 
04 20 54 03 LMP Maybe you ought to crank if. back down a little 
bit. 
04 20 54 16 LMP Great. 
04 20 54 52 (Fnd music) 
04 20 54 53 CC Apollo 8, Houston. How was that? 
04 20 54 58 LMP That's real good for background level type, 
Ken. Maybe you can do some logging in here 
so that's real nice at that level; maybe for 
anything else it could be a little bit louder, 
but that's good for now. 
04 20 55 10 CC okay * Thats about the MAX volume we can 
take down here; so if you want to talk to us, 
you may have to call us once or twice. You're 
0 
just barely equaling it. 
04 20 55 24 LLMP okay. Try it again, and 1'11 give you a little 
louder call; I've been trying to keep it 
quiet. 
04 20 55 30 CC Oh, yes, that's all right. Don't - I was 
aware yoti were calling; I.just didn't make out 
what you said. And from now on, any time you 

call, we'll drop the music, and I'll talk to 
you. 

04 20 55 42 LMP Roger. Don't hesitate for me a bit. 

    Tape 77 
    Page 6 
04 20 55 46 CC Right. 
04 20 56 00 CC And, Bill, we're going to have to wait until 
we get around to Bravo before we start switch- 
ing. Our margin is still a little bit low. 
04 20 56 10 LMP Okay. I'll just go ahead and switch it and 
save you all that trouble. 
04 20 56 14 CC Ckay. Thank you. 0~ midnight DVA show's 
back on the air. 
04 20 56 20 J&P Roger. 
04 20 56 25 (Begin music) 
04 20 57 11 L&P Really great now. 
04 21 14 57 CC Apollo 8, Houston. Check your yaw gimbal angle. 
04 21 14 58 (End music) 
04 21 15 04 LMP You must have been reading my mind. 
04 21 15 07 CC No, th\? DSKY's. 
04 21 15 13 LMP Oh, okay. 
04 21 15 21 Ltw When you go to high gain, would you tell me? 
04 21 15 46 LMP Houston, Apollo 8. 
04 21 15 53 CC Go ahead, Apollo 8. 
04 21 15 56 LMP Ken, do you want me to use the high gain wher, 
we come around, or is the OMNI sufficient? It 
doesn't matter to me. 
04 21 16 07 CC Okay. The OMNI is doing fine. I was just 
watching your middle gimbal angle there; it 'vzs 
getting a little far out. 

    Tape 77 
    Page 7 
04 21 16 17 LLMP Oh, okay. 
thought 
I thought 
you said 
you - I was, too. 
check the DSKY, and I thought 
I 
you were talking about the hi& gain antenna. 
04 21 16 23 CC No, I'm sorry. I was just watching your middle 
gimbal. 
04 21 16 25 LMP Yes, this thing really slops around in deadband, 
but it's really nice flying otherwise. 
04 21 16 40 CC Glad to hear that. 
04 21 16 47 INEJ All I have used the while trip is pulse. 
04 21 16 54 CC You just woke the doctor up. You said pulse, 
and he came alive. And he'd like to know if 
you did in fact, check out the BIOMED harness. 
04 21 17 07 LNP Yes, I tightened down all the plugs and checked 
c; all the leads, and everything lookeu in order. 
And when the other fellows wake up, if you 
remind me, why, I'll give it a more thorough 
going over. 
04 21 17 55 CC Okay, Bill. It's been suggested that they would 
    like to see you try switching the two leads, 
    you know, a yellow and a blue one, and just go 
    ahead and switch them, and they'll sacrifice 
    their pneumogram because they'd rather have the 
    EKG. 
04 21 18 25 LMP Do they need it now, or can they wait until 
    somebody else wakes up? 

    Tape 77 
    Page 8 
04 21 18 35 (x: I guess we can wait, Bill. Is that a hard 
thing to get to? 
04 21 18 43 LMFJ You have to take your pants off and about 
everything else - stand by. 
04 21 22 07 Row's that, Houston? 
04 21 22 13 Okay. Stand by, Bill. We'll take a look at 
it. 
04 21 22 30 Houston, Apollo 8. 
04 21 22 33 Roger. Read you. We're looking at data now. 
(Laughter) 
04 21 22 40 I suppose you'll tell me my heart has quit 
beating. 
04 21 22 44 We couldn't argue with you. That doesn't help 
at all. That's pretty bad. 
04 21 23 12 Is the pneumogram IO-GO for entry? 
04 21 23 17 Roger. 
04 21 23 24 0ne thiug you might be interested in: we 
listened to that low speed information that 
you taped on the first couple of REX's that 
we thought was going to be unusable. And it 
must have been a grocnd problem because it's 
coming in loud and clear now. 
04 21 23 41 Hey, that's great. I was just writing a long 
dissertation on why we have problems and can't 
use that l?SE in low bit rate. So that's real 
good. 

    Tape 77 
    Page 9 
04 21 23 55 CC Yes, it's coming in loud and clear. Pretty 
interesting. 
04 21 24 00 LMP Let me tell you, it was a hectic revolution. 
04 21 25 13 LMP If you've got the music going, I'm not hearing 
it, Ken. 
04 21 25 17 - CC No, I vas waiting to see what we did on that 
before I started it up again. 
04 21 25 23 LMP Okay. If they could hold off here for a couple 
of hours, if they have anything at all, just 
tell them,I'm alive, why, I'll give my real 
good going over here when I get done. I might 
even make a statement to the world that I haven't 
noticed that their little amplifiers had gotten 
hot. 
04 21 25 41 CC You say it did get hot? 
04 21 25 46 LMe NC, I hadn't even Goticed it until I started 
changing the lead. 
04 21 25 49 CC Oh, okay.. Okay. I'm going to crank the music 
up agein then. 
04 21 25 56 LMP Okay. Have they got anything at all down there? . 
04 21 26 00 CC Well, we're on low bit rate right now, so it'll 
be a few minutes before we get a chance to take 
another look at it. We'll let you know if you 
get sick. 
04 21 26 07 LMP Oh, well, ue csn hold off for a little while. 
04 21 26 13 CC Roger. 

    Tape 77

04 21 27 02 LMP I can't hear it, but it sounds like something 
I'd rather not hear anyway.

04 22 17 19 (End of music) 
04 22 17 40 IMe Houston, Apollo a. 
04 22 17 43 CC Hello, Apollo a. We interrupt this program of 
music to bring you the late evening status report. 
04 22 17 50 LMP Good. What's up? 
04 22 17 56 CC Okay. We are getting ready to have a shift turn- 
over, and I vanted to go over a few items before 
I ao: On the midcourse correction nunber 6: right 
now, that looks like it is at most 0.3 a foot per 
second, so there will be no burn for midcourse 
number 6. Midcourse number 7 is a little larger, 
and we'll make a decision on that later. Your 
weather in landing site still reported as being good 
and the forecast to be --bout 2000 scattered and 
I2 000 broken, about the same numbers they gave 
Prank earlier. Visibility vi11 be about 10 miles, 
wave height about 4 feet. And I guess there is some 
scattered thundershowers, like less than 5 percent, 
that you should worry about. And they're 10 to 
30 percent maybe at 2000, broken as opposed to 
scattered; so it looks pretty fair. We have got 
a-- 
04 22 19 12 LMP Just my kind of weather. 
04 22 19 14 CC Roger. Got a couple of flight plan things to 
consider. Now number 1 at 119:30: we have got a 
/I P52 IMJ realignment which we need to slip in ahead 

    Tape 78 
    Page 2 
of the P23 sightings, and that will be an option 3 
!SEFSMAT. 
04 22.19 40 LMP Roger. 
04 22 19 45 CC Okay. Some of the folks in sitting back and 
looking at the TV business have some ideas about 

things they would like to see tried with the filters. 
And I would like to read you what they have here 
and let you think about it; and in the next 10 hours, 
you can decide whether or not you think it is worth 
the effort. Basically, they would like to try using 

a whole different series of filters - - 
04 22 21 04 LAP Okay, Ken. I got something to write on. Was that 
c- .P52 at 18:30 or 19:30? 
04 22 21 11 CC l.l9:30. 
04 22 21 15 LMP Okay. I'm ready to copy on !FV. 
04 22 21 31 CC okay * Before you copy, let me read it all through 
to you here so you vi11 get the feel for what it 
is we are talking about. The title of this little 
epistle is "TV and Film Photography Correlation 
%periment," and what they want to do is mount 
the TV camera with the telephoto lens on a bracket. 
in the rendezvous window and take a TV picture 
of the earth through the red and blu+ filters, 
lminute per filter; that means red and blue 
filters individually. Then they would like to 
C! take a TV picture cf the earth through through 
the red, in this case, the 25 Alfa filter combined 

    Tape 78 
    Page 3  
with the polarizing filter. Rotate the polarizing I 
filter through 360-degree increments, again 1 minute I 
per position. Then they'd like to take a TV picture 
of the moon with the polarizing filter at 360-degree 
I moon-rotation increments and again, : minute per 
position. And to go with this, we would like 5; 
have Hasselblad pictures. 
04 22 22 44 LMP One minute. 
04 22 22 45 CC Okay. I am standing by. 
04 22 22 49 LMP Are those - when you were talking aboc-t'pictures 
through the polarizing filter, is that the TV pictures 
*. through the polarizing filter? 
04 22 22 55 CC That's affirmative. All above was 'TJ. 
c 
04 22 22 59 LMP okay. Now the only thing - the only problem here 
is it's darn near impossible to aim that television 
camera ; the field of view is so narrow that it 
took three men and a boy ug here to get the thing 
pointed in the right direction. And we tried using 
cheving gum for a sight and everything else, and 
let me tell you that the odds of getting that thing 
in the earth is pretty smali. 
04 22 23 25 CC Okay. I think we weren't too clever in our ground 
callup as to how to point the spacecraft. For one 
thing I think we can do that a lot better next time 
now that we have stumbled through it once. I agree \ 
1 
with you - - r 

    Tape 78 
    Page 4 
04 22 23 41 r.MP It's not the spacecraft; it's not the spacecraft 
that's hard to point, it's the camera. The bracket 
has sufficient slump in it that it can take the 
camera out of field of view when configured thrcllgh 
the window. And it took a lot of microadjustments 
with a lot of coaching from the ground to get the 
thing in, and it was a real tough job. So I think 
you ought to take all this in mind; if you could 
possibly use the wide angle, you might be better off. 
04 22 24 14 CC Okay. I understand what you are saying now. I'-1 
run that back by the TV guys and see what they have 
to say about that. In conjunction with the above, 
CJ they wanted to take some Hasselblad pictures of the 
earth through the rendezvous window with the red 
and blue filter and black and white film, and then 
again through the polarizing filter, and this,is ail 
going to be used in order to try and correlate the 
!l!V and the regular film photography. So if you think 
.. it is a worthwhile thing, and you would like to give 
it a try, I'll run this by Jack and the TV cats and 
see if they would like.to get something out of it  with the wide angle, and we can talk about it a little 
later. 
04 22 25 05 rm Okay. Another thing to keep in mind is that we 
haven't si-en the moon - we didn't see a11 the uay 
out ) and we rarely see it going back. Ue have seen 
it once since we left, but we have uar.euvered the 

    Tape 78 
    Page 5 
wrong way from a sighting attitude to the shortest 
way to mc; and to go from an earth view to a lunar 
view will take quite a bit of time and some RCS. 
So you might keep that in mind, too. 
04 22 25 35 CC okay. I just wanted you to .be aware of this and 
think about it and what its implications to the 
flight plan might be, and I'll run this wide angle 
and comment about the moon back by and see which 
sections they think would be most appropriate. 
okay. On the EMS scroll, Frank wanted us to verify 
the order that he could expect to see the entry 
profile, and the first profile that comes up is 
labelled "Nonexit Number 2" and that is the short- 
range high-speed entry. The second thing that will 
come up is entitled "The 3500 Mile" irhich i; also 
high-speed entry, but it is the one you wo'lld use 
in event we go to the longer entry rznges. Then 
the third profile will be "Nonexit Entry Number 1," 
and it will be followed by a forth 3509 rile. SO 
you have four entry profiles. Numbers 1 and 3, as 
you come to them, are the short ranges, and numbers 2 
and 4 are the long-range scrolls. On coldsoak, 
I think we talked about what we're going to do there, 
but somewhere inside of about an hour, ~'11 want 
to get into the coldsoak business. lie certainly 
don't want to do it at 12. Talking to the trajectory 
people - vhat they thought about water boiling - 

    Tape 78 
    page 6 
something to keep in mind is the fact that they 
do see your water dumps and water boiling on your 
trajectory plot. It seems to be that it's a func- 
tion of their computational scheme rather than a 
function of the fact that the trajectory is being 
perturbed that much. So it looks like one time that 
we're going to consider, if we're going to do some 
of this water boiling, we may do it just prior to 
the midcourse after all the tracking is settied 
down and they know what the midcourse correction 

trill be. Then in that period just prior to the 
midcourse we can do it, and they'll pick up their 
0 tracking agair following the midcourse correction. 
So if someone proposes that the - - It is probably 
nice to know that we are not throwing away our 
data at the most important time, that it is a func- 
tion of the computer program rather than so much 
a function of your trajectory being changed. 
04 22 28 04 LMP Let me ask you one thing then. Do you want a 
coldsoak sone',ime prior to the midcourse correction 
. for 1 hour. Is that what you're trying to tell me? 
0422.2812 . CC Not really. I think we are looking at that prior 
to the midcourse correction as being the time 
when we would like to check out the water boilers. 
The coldsoak does involve some water boiler, too, 
but that's going to be done right before entry vhcn 
these things are not going to be very sensitive, 

    Tape 78 
    Page 7 
and if we don't do it in 12 hours, it is not 
real clear where the coldsoak takes place or 
where you turn on the secondary water boiler. 
In looking through the eniry checklist tonight, 
we didn't find a place for that. 
04 22 28 48 IalP Okay. Is it really clear that you need the cold 
soak? Ue kind of figured on sometime prior to 
SEP bringing up the secondary J3VAP, and also 
having the primary at that point sometime prior 
to that date on your suggestion. 
04 22 29 06 CC Okay. We're talking about doing that like an hour 
prior to SEP; but in the pre-SRP check, one of the 
things we power down was the secondary loop. And 
they won't need to turn it back. 
04 22 29 21 L24P Ye do that to save - - 
04 22 29 22 CC Right. We're doing that to keep our power profile 
where we want it. And then we're going to be turn- 
ing it back on sometime prior to entry. And the time 
to turn it on in entry, of course, isn't specifiec' 
because as you turn it on, the voltages show that 
they can hack it. 
04 22 29 41 CD2 Hopetilly. right after separation. 
04 22 29 43 CC That sounds like a real good place. Okay- Iâ€™m 
sure we're going to discuss that one a 1itLle bit 
more, Bill. But right now those are the kind of 
things we're talking about doing. Ad on the 
high gain, there is still a lot of discussion about 

    Tape 78 
    Page 8 
as to what - exactly what we saw and what it 
means. And I think it is a little too early to 
tell you anything about that one. 
04 22 30 11 LMP Roger. I think it's got X-ray eyes. 
04 22 30 17 CC That's as good as some of the explanetions. 
04 22 30 26 LMP Yes, I think that's what they hashed out CC the 
ground, Ken. 
04 22 30 29 CC Okay. I think we all agree that we don't uant 
to try experimenting with it if we really don't 
know what it is we're looking at. 
04 22 30 39 LMP Roger. I've written down some numbers here that 
I hope will be helpful. 
04 22 30 43 CC Okay. Fine. 
04 22 30 46 LMP And I'll give them to you in the debriefing. 
04 22 30 49 CC Real fine. 
04 22 30 52 LMP I don't think it's any great big deal, because 
the antenna switching is not hard at all and the 
-a. is required to work; if it doesn't work as 
advertised, at least it works in a reasonable 
manner. 
04 22 31 26 CC Okay. And we're looking at 120 hours for,the next 
water dump, Bill. 
04 22 33 41 LMP Ken, is it my imagination, or do you have the 
music running? 
04 22 33 45 CC I'm sorry; say again. 
04 22 33 49 Im Is it my imagination, or do you have the music 
running?

04 22 33 54 CC I think it's your imagination. 
04 22 33 59 LMP Uh-oh. Don't let the doctors hear that. 
04 22 34 01 CC It's too late; he already heard you: 
04 22 34 06 LMP I must be getting that detached feeling. 
04 22 36 49 LMP Apollo 8, Houston. 
04 22 36 51 CC Go ahead, 8. 
04 22 36 55 LMP Roger. Just to make sure the urge to get red 
    and blue filter shots of the moon haven't crept 
    into this TV test. We have got red and blue 
    filter shots of the moon, 50 you need not worry 
    about that. 
04 22 37 12 CC Okay. I don't think that would throw it away. I 
    think we're trying to come up with something definitive 
    so that postflight will have some real good data 
    to compare with what we do on the ground for future 
    work. I would like to have you go over and take a 
    look at the battery Charlie, please. 
04 22 37 35 LMP I'm on my way. 
04 22 38 08 LMP Okay. Battery Charlie, that's about 36.8 volts. 
04 22 38 13 CC Okay, 26.8. Thank you. 
04 22 38 19 LMP Roger. 
04 22 38 26 LMP Also with respect to the TV test, I would think 
    that we could probably get a pretty good handle 
    on the operation just by taking red and blue and 
    polarizing shots of the earth independent of the 
    TV, but within the same time frame or at about the 
    same range we had the TV last time.
