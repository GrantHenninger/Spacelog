[00:00:04:02]
BELL 7: OK, I'm going to skip the yaw, ah, or roll because I'm a little bit late and I'm going to try this rough yaw maneuver. About all I can really see is clouds. I haven't seen any land anyplace yet.

[00:00:04:15]
CC: Roger, you're on the window. Are you trying a yaw maneuver?

[00:00:04:18]
