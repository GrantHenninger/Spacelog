[00:00:00:21]
P: Roger.

[00:00:00:28]
P: OK. The fuel is go; about 1 ½ g's; cabin pressure is just coming off the peg; the O<sub>2</sub> is go; we have 26 amps.

[00:00:00:36]
CC: Roger. Pitch 88, the trajectory is good.

[00:00:00:39]
P: Roger, looks good here.

[00:00:00:54]
P: OK, there. We're starting to pick up a little bit of the noise and vibration; not bad, though, at all. 50 secs., more vibration.

[00:00:01:04]
P: OK. The fuel is go; 1 ½ g's, cabin is 8, the O<sub>2</sub> is go, 27 amps.

CC: Pitch is 77; trajectory is go.

[00:00:01:13]
_page: 2
P: Roger. Cabin pressure is still about 6 and dropping slightly. Looks like she's going to hold at about 5.5.

[00:00:01:23]
P: Eh ...
CC: Cabin ...

[00:00:01:24]
P: Believe me, O<sub>2</sub> is go.

[00:00:02:31]
CC: Roger.

[00:00:02:33]
P: There went posigrades, capsule has separated. We are at zero g and turning around and the sun is really bright.

[00:00:02:42]
CC: Roger, [glossary:capsep|cap sep] is green, turnaround started, manual handle out.

[00:00:02:47]
P: Oh boy! Manual handle is out; the sky is very, very black; the capsule is coming around into orbit attitude; the roll is a little bit slow.

[00:00:03:01]
CC: Roger.

[00:00:03:02]
_page: 3
P: I haven't seen a booster anyplace. OK, rate command is coming on. I'm in orbit attitude, I'm pitching up. OK, 40 ... Wait, I've lost some roll here someplace.

[00:00:03:10]
CC: Roger, rate command is coming on. You're trying manual pitch.

[00:00:03:15]
P: OK, I got roll back. OK, I'm at 24 in pitch.

[00:00:03:20]
CC: Roger, your [glossary:IP] is right on, Gus, right on.

[00:00:03:24]
P: OK. I'm having a little trouble with rate, ah, with the manual control.

[00:00:03:28]
CC: Roger.

[00:00:03:31]
P: If I can get her stabilized here, all axes are working all right.

[00:00:03:36]
CC: Roger. Understand manual control is good.

[00:00:03:40]
P: Roger, it's – it's sort of sluggish, more than I expected.

[00:00:03:45]
P: OK, I'm yawing.

[00:00:03:47]
CC: Roger, yaw.

[00:00:03:50]
P: Left, ah.

[00:00:03:51]

[00:00:03:57]
CC: Roger. Reading you loud and clear, Gus.

[00:00:03:59]
P: Lot of stuff – there's a lot of stuff floating around up here.

[00:00:04:02]
P: OK, I'm going to skip the yaw, ah, or roll because I'm a little bit late and I'm going to try this rough yaw maneuver. About all I can really see is clouds. I haven't seen any land anyplace yet.

[00:00:04:15]
CC: Roger, you're on the window. Are you trying a yaw maneuver?

[00:00:04:18]
P: I'm trying the yaw maneuver and I'm on the window. It's such a fascinating view out the window you just can't help but look out that way.

[00:00:04:25]
CC: I understand.

[00:00:04:29]
P: You su-, ah, really. There I see the coast, I see.

_page: 4
P: I can see the coast but I can't identify anything.

[00:00:04:42]
CC: Roger, 4 plus 30 Gus.

[00:00:04:44]
P: OK, let me get back here to retro attitude, retro sequence has started.

[00:00:04:48]
CC: Roger, retro sequence has started. Go to retro attitude.

[00:00:04:52]
P: Right, we'll see if I'm bad, not in very good shape here.

[00:00:04:57]
CC: Got 15 seconds, plenty of time, I'll give you a mark at [time:00:00:05:10|5:10].

[00:00:05:01]
