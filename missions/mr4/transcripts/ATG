STONY: Lift-off.

[00:00:00:03]
P: Loud and clear.

[00:00:00:08]
CC: Loud and clear. José, don't cry too much.

[00:00:00:11]
P: Okey dokey.

[00:00:00:18]
P: OK, it's a nice ride up to now.

[00:00:00:20]
CC: Loud and clear.

[00:00:00:21]
P: Roger.

[00:00:00:28]
P: OK. The fuel is go; about 1 ½ g's; cabin pressure is just coming off the peg; the O2 is go; we have 26 amps.

[00:00:00:36]
CC: Roger. Pitch [attitude] 88 [degrees], the trajectory is good.

[00:00:00:39]
P: Roger, looks good here.

[00:00:00:54]
UKN: OK, there. We're starting to pick up a little bit of the noise and vibration; not bad, though, at all. 50 secs., more vibration.

[00:00:01:04]
P: OK. The fuel is go; 1 ½ g's, cabin is 8 [psi], the O2 is go, 27 amps.

[00:00:01:08]
P: And [Rest of communication not received.]

[00:00:01:09]
CC: Pitch is [Rest of communication not received.]

[00:00:01:10]
P: 4[g], 5[g] [Rest of communication not received.]

[00:00:01:11]
CC: Pitch [attitude] is 77 [degrees]; trajectory is go.

[00:00:01:13]
_page: 2
P: Roger. Cabin pressure is still about 6 [psi] and dropping slightly. Looks like she's going to hold at about 5.5 [psi].

[00:00:01:23]
P: Eh...[Rest of communication not received.]

[00:00:01:23]
CC: Cabin [Rest of communication not received.]

[00:00:01:24]
P: Believe me, O2 is go.

[00:00:01:26]
CC: Cabin pressure holding 5.5 [psi].

[00:00:01:29]
P: Roger, roger.

[00:00:01:31]
P: This is Liberty Bell 7. Fuel is go, 2 ½ g's; cabin pressure 5.5 [psi]; O2 is go; main [bus] 25 [volts], isolated – ah, isolated [bus] is 28 [volts]. We are go.

[00:00:01:46]
CC: Roger. Pitch [attitude] is 62 [degrees]; trajectory is go.

[00:00:01:49]
P: Roger. It looks good in here.

[00:00:01:56]
P: Everything is good; cabin pressure is holding; suit pressure is OK; 2 minutes and we got 4 g's; fuel is go; ah, feel the hand controller move just a hair there; cabin pressure is holding; O2 is go; 25 amps.

[00:00:02:15]
CC: Roger, we have go here.

[00:00:02:16]
P: And I see a star!

[00:00:02:17]
CC: Stand by for cutoff.

[00:00:02:23]
P: There went the tower.

[00:00:02:24]
CHASE1: Roger, there went the tower, affirmative Chase.

[00:00:02:26]
P: Roger, squibs are off.

[00:00:02:31]
CC: Roger.

[00:00:02:33]
P: There went posigrades, capsule has separated. We are at zero g and turning around and the sun is really bright.

[00:00:02:42]
CC: Roger, cap sep [capsule separation light] is green, turnaround started, manual handle out.

[00:00:02:47]
P: Oh boy! Manual handle is out; the sky is very black; the capsule is coming around into orbit attitude; the roll is a little slow.

[00:00:03:01]
CC: Roger.

[00:00:03:02]
_page: 3
P: I haven't seen a booster anyplace. OK, rate command is coming on. I'm in orbit attitude, I'm pitching up. OK, 40 [Rest of communication not received.] Wait, I've lost some roll here someplace.

[00:00:03:10]
CC: Roger, rate command is coming on. You're trying manual pitch.

[00:00:03:15]
P: OK, I got roll back. OK, I'm at 24 [degrees] in pitch.

[00:00:03:20]
CC: Roger, your IP [impact point] is right on, Gus, right on.

[00:00:03:24]
P: OK. I'm having a little trouble with rate, ah, with the manual control.

[00:00:03:28]
CC: Roger.

[00:00:03:31]
P: If I can get her stabilized here, all axes are working all right.

[00:00:03:36]
CC: Roger. Understand manual control is good.

[00:00:03:40]
P: Roger, it's – it's sort of sluggish, more than I expected.

[00:00:03:45]
P: OK, I'm yawing.

[00:00:03:47]
CC: Roger, yaw.

[00:00:03:50]
P: Left, ah.

[00:00:03:51]
P: OK, coming back in yaw. I'm a little bit late there.

[00:00:03:57]
CC: Roger. Reading you loud and clear, Gus.

[00:00:03:59]
P: Lot of stuff – there's a lot of stuff floating around up here.

[00:00:04:02]
P: OK, I'm going to skip the yaw [maneuver], ah, or [rather the] roll [maneuver] because I'm a little bit late and I'm going to try this rough yaw maneuver. About all I can really see is clouds. I haven't seen any land anyplace yet.

[00:00:04:15]
CC: Roger, you're on the window. Are you trying a yaw maneuver?

[00:00:04:18]
P: I'm trying the yaw maneuver and I'm on the window. It's such a fascinating view out the window you just can't help but look out that way.

[00:00:04:25]
CC: I understand.

[00:00:04:29]
P: You su-, ah, really. There I see the coast, I see.

[00:00:04:30]
CC: 4 plus 30 [elapsed time since launch] Gus.

[00:00:04:33]
UKN: 4 plus 30 [elapsed time since launch], he's looking out the
window. A-OK.

[00:00:04:37]
_page: 4
P: I can see the coast but I can't identify anything.

[00:00:04:42]
CC: Roger, 4 plus 30 [elapsed time since launch] Gus.

[00:00:04:44]
P: OK, let me get back here to retro attitude, retro sequence has started.

[00:00:04:48]
CC: Roger, retro sequence has started. Go to retro attitude.

[00:00:04:52]
P: Right, we'll see if I'm bad, not in very good shape here.

[00:00:04:57]
CC: Got 15 seconds, plenty of time, I'll give you a mark at 5:10 [elapsed time since launch].

[00:00:05:01]
P: OK, retro attitude [light] is still green.

[00:00:05:05]
CC: Retros on my mark, 3, 2, 1, mark. [Unidentified communicator says “He's in limits,” in the middle of last Cap Com communication.]
