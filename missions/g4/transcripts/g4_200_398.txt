the sleep cycle and I just finished ...
42 38 58 CC Roger, everything looks good from down here.
42 40 01 P Right.
42 40 05 CC Gemini 4, we'll have LOS in about 1 minute here.
Do you have anything?
42 40 10 P Negative, Gemini 4. And be advised on the D-9 of
the Apollo Landmarks. Don't have any attitude
around that would permit getting very much on them.
42 40 21 CC Roger, we understand on that. That's okay.

43 32 05 CC Roger. Read you loud and clear. Can you give me a
little info on how your control went over North
Africa, and how much pulsing did you do?
43 32 12 P Roger, we used Pulse Control in a minimum amount;
the target of number 12 was obscured by clouds; I
had the time and location pretty well squared away.
I could have tracked if I could have seen the target,
I believe. Target number 13, it was in the
clear, and I was able to pick up the city of
Alexandria. The airport I think I ... but I
haven't been able to put my attention on looking
for the airport. I could have spotted the airport.
I went ahead and operated the camera and took some
pictures as I passed over it. The location of the
target from the data called up was satisfactory.
43 32 58 CC Roger, what time did you turn your ACME power supply
off?
43 33 01 P Roger. I turned my ACME power supply off, I would
estimate at about 35.

45 57 41 C Thank you. How are you?
45 57 44 CC Had a good night's sleep.
45 57 47 C I got a little more sleep this time than I have in
the past.
45 57 49 CC How about that plug in your throat there. Hav_
you taken that out when you were sleeping?
45 58 01 C Oh. Negative, I didn't disconnect my radio. I
left it on.
45 58 05 CC Did it bother you at all?
45 58 08 C It has been up till now, but this time I guess I
was pretty tired, and I slept without it.
45 58 13 CC Very good ... Gemini 4, Houston. You can turn
your Quantity Read Switch OFF now.
45 58 30 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. You can turn your

45 58 38 CC Roger, you're looking good here. Have a good day.
45 58 41 C Roger.
45 59 12 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM, We have your
02 tank pressures around 970.
45 59 21 C Okay. We're reading about 960. We'll dump ...
45 59 25 CC Okay . Understand.
46 05 10 S When was this going ON?
46 05 15 C Cabin temperature is going ON at 13:22.

Section CANARY ISLANDS

46 05 29 CC Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
46 05 31 C Go ahead, Canary, Gemini 4.
46 05 34 CC Roger. Request that you use the Cabin Recheck Valve
instead of 02 High Rate. Also, be advised that
Houston says do not relieve through the cabin if you
can avoid it.

Page 207
46 05 34 C We don't need a push.
46 05 54 C We don't have any other place to put the oxygen
except in the cabin. We've Just finished doing it
to the 02 High Rate. We got the ECS 02 pressure
down to 910.
46 06 02 CC Roger. They were warning you to avoid relieving
through the cabin area.
46 06 06 C 02 pressure down to 910.
46 06 09 CC Roger. I understand 910.
46 06 10 C Can you tell me why they want to use the Repress
instead of the 02 High Rate? Where else would we
put the oxygen?
46 06 20 CC Roger.
46 06 24 P Jim, we're not ...
46 06 30 C Well, he said that in order to get MSC-1 they wanted
the ACQ Aid Beacon OFF for 5 minutes. You know,
you were going to leave -to do some ECS on and
off ... thruster.
46 06 41 P Okay,
46 06 50 P Cabin temperature comes ON at --I put it ON already.
46 06 53 C I don't know ...
46 06 58 c ...
46 07 05 CC Gemini 4. Canary CAP COM.
46 07 05 C Go ahead.
46 07 07 CC Roger. The reason for using the Repress was to
avoid turning off your fans and to cut down on your
noise level in your cabin.
46 07 17 c Okay.
46 07 20 CC They meant do not relieve overboard if you can avoid
it.
46 07 26 C Oh. don't ... they don't want to vent the ECS 02
tank overboard directly. They want to vent it overboard
through the cabin. Is that it?
46 07 34 CC They don't want to avoid overboard at all if possible.
46 07 36 C Roger. I know it.

Page 208
46 07 52 CC Okay. Your 02 usage for the last 24 hours -- correction
-- over the last 2 or 3 hours has been
25 percent higher than normal.
46 08 00 C Roger. Our cabin's been holding all right. There
really doesn't seem to be much we can do about that.
That tank pressure goes up and that is just about
all there is to it. We're actually venting oxygen
overboard that we don't need to.
46 08 14 CC Roger.
46 08 19 C How is our 02 consumption? I've been plotting it
and it looks like we're in reasonably good shape.
46 08 40 P It doesn't rea31y call out for my time hack ...
46 08 44 C Okay.
46 08 50 P ... get a drink of something.
46 08 52 C I'm thirsty.
46 08 56 CC Your rate even at your present rate - you have 5 or
10 hours more than you need plus secondary 02 .
46 09 03 C Okay, fine. Thank you.
46 09 07 C And I'll try to take your advice and not vent any
overboard, but I Just don't know how I'm going to
do that.
46 09 12 CC Roger, we understand.
46 10 00 P You know, it's going to be tough getting 14 ...
recording ...
46 10 05 C Aw, hell no.
46 10 07 C ACQ Aid Beacon is going OFF at 13: 42.

I'd like a few readouts from you.
46 39 10 C Okay.
46 39 11 CC I'd like 0A_ source helium temp, pressure, and
propellant quantity.
46 39 35 C Propellant quantity --I have about 61 percent remainlng.
It fluctuates a little between there and
about 63.
46 39 43 CC Roger. How about your helium temp and helium pressure?
OAMS source helium temp and 0AMS source
helium pressure.
46 40 04 P The helium temperature is 58 and the pressure is
under 2000.
46 40 12 CC You say a little under what?

Page 211
47 03 48 P Way up too high for me.
47 03 50 C Too high?
47 03 52 P Yes, way too high. I can't possibly get it unless
you pitch up to it and yaw back down.
47 04 02 P No, - yes, but we didn't get it. I've got Gemini
coming up now. No, that's not Gemini, that's part
of the Southern Cross.
47 04 19 P No, it crossed right through -high.
47 04 26 P Yes, I saw it go across the very top of my wind_.
Is that where it was on yours?
47 04 38 C Right now, you're not even seeing ...
47 04 43 p Okay, now I think it's coming where I can see it.
47 04 57 C You've got to hav_ a whole segment ...
47 05 07 C I can take a sighting on it now ...
47 05 14 P Yes, I got a sighting from it.
47 05 16 C Did you?
47 05 17 p Yes.
47 05 52 C ...
47 05 52 p Roll to the right.
47 05 52 C ...
47 05 57 P Huh?
47 05 57 C ...
47 06 02 P Yes, roll it.
47 06 07 P Yes, the horizon is gone and I ... The star's

47 08 50 P It's only 23Â° right now ...
47 09 02 C ...
47 09 28 P Can you roll it to the left a little bit; I have
too much horizon now.
47 09 28 C That's what I think. How about rolling It just
horizontal?
47 09 50 P Oh, boy, there goes all the "0" rings.
47 09 57 C Okay.
47 10 02 C I can't get the horizon.
47 10 04 P Okay.

47 10 52 P The horizon's gone now.
47 10 55 C When?
47 10 56 P I don't have a horizon anymore.
47 10 58 C Disappeared.
47 10 59 P Yes.
47 11 02 C Same here with me. I don't know whether I'm up_
down, sideways, or anything else. I like to at
least know the orientation.
47 11 07 P Okay, we never got a good one on that.
47 11 09 C Okay, we've been _nnlng into problems.
47 11 12 P We tried to get Antares twice.
47 11 36 C Can you see into this side?
47 11 38 P Not ... try bring myself around.
47 11 43 C You can control it if you like.
47 11 48 P I might be able to get it better that way.
47 12 12 P Where'd my book go?
47 12 28 C Oh, shoot!
47 12 40 C ... horizon comes back ...

Page 213
47 12 45 P Okay, I got it. But before I can shoot any stars
I've got to ge_ this stuff behind me, or I won't
see a star. What are you looking for? Okay. I've
got it pitched this way and roll it back in there
or I won't see anything.
47 13 16 P I guess it's not.
47 13 21 C See any stars?
47 13 26 p A_few stars - okay. Yaw more to the right.
47 13 26 p Okay. The stars are back out again.
47 13 38 C No, I didn't expect ...
47 13 52 p What I have to do is keep my window shaded all of
the time.
47 13 55 C Yes.
47 13 55 P Out of the sun and then I can see.
47 13 58 C Oh yes, I can see stars.
47 14 07 p ... of the stars in ... 178, that's pretty good
e e . . .
47 14 14 c ...
47 14 24 P I haven't got any horizon pictures..
47 14 24 c ...
47 14 31 P No, what I see now ...
47 14 38 p What I wanted to try to do ... Are you dark over
there?
47 14 45 P ...
47 14 57 C ...
47 15 15 P I don't see the stars. Do you?
47 15 26 p ... one time.
47 15 31 P I'm supposed to have the proper attitude.
47 15 40 P I can roll back over now, though.
47 15 48 P ...
47 15 50 C Yes...
47 16 38 P Got to keep the horizon in there.
47 17 16 C ...
47 17 23 P I don't think we do. I'm in a good black now.

Page 214
47 17 26 C ...
47 17 28 P As far as the shade. I'm shaded enough ...
47 17 31 C ... the star and the sky.
47 17 38 P Neither can I.
47 17 43 C ...
47 17 45 P Okay, you go ahead and see if you can find any.
47 17 47 C ...
47 17 52 P They're Just not there.
47 17 55 C Okay, let me try it...
47 18 02 P Okay.
47 18 04 c ... the recorder OFF.
47 18 04 C ... the recorder OFF.
47 18 16 C ...
47 18 16 P ...
47 18 28 P Yes, ...
47 18 33 C Okay, we're starting to pitch up close to the horizon
now, and ...
47 18 43 C Okay. Blunt-end-forward so the sun's behind us.
47 18 48 C I st111 see no stars.
47 18 50 P No, neither can I.
47 19 02 C I have a black sky out there, but I'm getting reflection
off the window. How about you?
47 19 07 P Yes, T get a lot of reflections off that dirty outside
part.
47 19 11 C Half of my window is black and the other has a little
sun shining on it. Sun shining on the nose of the
spacecraft so I've got to look past a lighted object.
I don't see a star, and I never have seen the stars
in the daylight... much better at sunrise when
half the spacecraft is dark and the other half is
light.
47 19 31 P Yes, then you can see it.
47 19 35 C Okay, my window's in the surlight. How about yours?
47 19 39 P Mine's in sunlight too ...

Page 215
47 19 47 C Heck, I guess t_t what we're saying is that ...
D-9 cannot be done in the daylight.
47 20 02 P I concur.
47 20 07 P Right now, there doesn't seem to be a way for us to
find any stars in the daylight.
47 20 07 C No, it sure doesn't. There's no way you can see
them.
47 20 10 P There is certainly no way to do it after ...
47 20 19 p Okay.
47 20 28 C ... a long window. A window that has a long ...
off the window where you can look straight off the
ce.ce
47 20 38 P ...
47 20 40 C ... okay, ... look out ...
47 21 43 C I don't see a star anywhere.
47 21 45 P I know I can't. I've got direct sunshine on my
window.
47 21 50 C ...
47 21 55 P ...
47 21 59 C ... nose of the spacecraft.
47 22 02 P Yes.
47 22 19 P Yes ...
47 22 21 P Okay.
47 23 33 C MY window's not in the light any more, and I still
don't see the stars. If there's any possibility in
the world to see stars in the daylight and horizon
at the same time, I'm in the position right now
where I should be able to do it. And don't have
the sun on the nose of the spacecraft. It's on the
bottom. I can see the bottom, and I can't see a
single star, not a single star.
47 23 39 C Go ahead, Houston. C_emtni4.
47 23 40 CC Roger, are you busy with D-97
47 23 45 C No, I think it Just drew to a close. We Just can't
see the stars in the daylight, and we can't carry on
the daylight portion of it. We'll wait till we get
back to the nighttime and do a little bit more with
that.

47 23 54 CC Roger, Jim. I want to talk to you about this 02
high usage rate thing.
47 24 00 C Okay.
47 24 01 CC We don't think it's any problem. We would like for
you to put your Q_ntity Read Switch ON and leave
it on for the next several hours so we can get a
feel frr what's going on. Even at the rate that's
been used in the last several hours, it won't be
any problem, but we'd like to find some way to control
this thing without it being a nuisance to use
so you won't be bothered with it. That's the reason
we want to take a look at it for some time. Don't
like the idea of you having to reduce pressures or
build up pressure every few minutes. Do you read
me?
47 24 41 C Houston, Gemini 4. I got the part where we leave
the Read Switch ON for a while, and then all the
rest cut off. Say again.
47 24 59 CC Okay. Jim, how do you read me now?
47 25 05 C ... for the next couple hours. Say after that.
47 25 35 CC Wait till we get B_rmml_tacquisition. I'll try you
there.

47 26 36 CC Gemini 4, Houston. How do you read now?
47 26 45 P Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
47 26 50 CC What I was saying - we want to get a hack on what's
going on with that pressure buildup in the Prin_ry
02 system. We want to try to find some way to control
it without you having to relieve cabin pressure
every few minutes or every few hours, so this is the
reason we want your Quantity Read Switch ON for the
next several hours.
47 27 11 C Okay. What did you say about my usage rate?
47 27 15 CC It's a little bit higher than it has been, but it
is nothing to worry about. You have plenty so don't
be concerned about it.

Page 217
47 27 24 C Okay. I've been plotting it_ and it looks like
we're going to end up with 7 or 8 percent remaining.
47 27 33 CC Yes, we're just trying to find some way to keep you
from having to relieve the cabin pressure every now
and then.
47 27 44 C Okay. Yes, I don't like that either.
47 27 46 CC Yes.
47 28 08 CC The Flight Surgeon would like to know if either one
of you had any trouble with drying around the eyes
or dry throat.
47 28 17 C My throat is a little dry, and our eyes were botherlng
us about the end of the first day quite a bit,
but that's all cleared up now.
47 28 25 CC Okay. Very good.
47 28 32 C Hey, Gus. Can you get me a G.m.t. hack?
47 28 35 CC Roger. I'll give it to you at 14 45 00. In about
20 seconds.
47 28 41 C Roger. 14 45 .....
47 28 50 CC Ten seconds to go.
47 28 57 CC 14 45 00 on my mark.
47 29 00 CC MARK!

47 29 10 CC Any complaints?
47 29 13 C No, except this thing isn't very big.
47 29 46 CC On your next pass over the States we_l] have the
latest news for you.
47 29 58 C Okay, very good.
47 30 43 C Ed and I were just co_nenting that the weightlessness
gives you a light-headed feeling, a heady
feeling.
47 32 43 P But not a heady feeling ...
47 32 45 C Yes, I did, and Ed was saying that his headache is
gone. He had one earlier.
47 32 50 C And I don't have one yet, but I feel closer to
having one now than I have had at any time. I
think it's this darn 100 percent oxygen. I breathe
it in and I don't think I've ever been this dry.

Page 218
With the worst cold I've ever had, where I can't
breathe through my nose a_.d I sound like I've got
a big deep cold. I sound to myself like I'm very
... but I can now if I -- I was when I was sleeping,
too. But it was burning my nose, act,,ally, when I
was sleeping. I had a very hoarse sound to myself.
Do I sound that way to you, too?
47 33 23 P Yes.
47 33 26 C ... But I think because of this 1OO percent oxygen
where I kept assim_lating it. I suspect that
maybe my ears and my sinuses are always below ambient
and I know I've got to pop .my ears about every
hour or two.
47 33 40 P I have a little ...
47 33 48 C Yes, my mouth and my throat are quite dry at this
time. As a matter of fact, I think we ought to
have a drink of water.
47 33 50 P You ought to put a little female velcro on the ...

about yaw? What do you say we're doing on yaw?
47 48 26 C ...
47 48 26 P We yawed right.
47 48 33 C Okay, we yawed right. That's what I think, too.
About 100 or so. You tell me if we're yawing
around ... to the left ... you tell me when
we get to ...
47 49 04 P ...
47 49 06 C Stand by. Yes, we do.
47 49 16 C. Okay, I'd say they're right there...

Page 220
47 49 18 P Yes, I'd say we're within a couple of degrees.
47 49 26 C Okay. Very good. Looks to me like I've yawed left
a little bit.
47 49 42 P ...
47 50 02 C Okay. Now I think I've yawed zero right there, Ed.
What do you think?
47 50 14 P Zero o_ just a little left. Right there.
47 50 16 C Okay.
47 50 18 P The ES sensor is coming off at this time.
47 51 57 C The right side of my head is getting sore where I
keep rubbing the hair the wrong way when I try to
turn my head inside my helmet so that I can look
through the window long ways. Get the best view I
can through it.
47 55 53 C Okay, we're just now approaching darkness again and
we're looking at stars with small-end-forward and
as yet, I don't see any. It's under my ...
47 56 11 P ...
47 56 33 C I think it does too, Ed.
47 56 38 C Okay, now half of what I see is light and the other
half is dark. So we're going a little bit sideways
to the small-end-forward, but Ed's side is in the
dark completely, I believe. Isn't it, Ed?
47 56 50 P I see a star ...
47 56 50 C Okay. First star was at 15:12 -- 15 12 52 it was.
47 57 02 P Right.
47 57 04 P ...
47 57 09 C We haven't crossed the terminator yet. You have a
horizon out there now, though, Ed.
47 57 14 P ...
47 57 21 C No ... yet. _f side's still in s_mlight.
47 57 26 P ...
47 57 33 C My side of the spacecraft is bathed in the s%u_llght
and I don't see the star.
47 57 38 P ...

Page 221
47 57 42 C Yes, I get the distinct impression that the upper
part of my window is a lot dirtier than the lower
part. Do you have that impression too, Ed?
47 57 53 P ...
47 57 54 C No, I think the gradation of this goop that's all
over it, whatever it is, looks like it's on about
here on up --looks like it's on about the zero
pitch line on up.
47 58 06 P There's plenty of stars out there, now.
47 58 09 C Okay, I still don't have any stars.
47 58 21 P There's a very pretty horizon out there now.
47 58 26 C Okay, I have my first star. - I'm quite sure that
this coating on my window is about zero pitch attitude
line on up. I can see a star down below that
... you'd think I'd be able to see it. It might
Just be the peculiar way the reflections are coming
back through the window.
47 59 11 C Okay, Edward, I'm going to leave the recorder on
until it runs out.
47 59 18 P I've done that already.
47 59 20 C What ... You Just ... as we go along?
47 59 30 P ... start out with a very fuzzy horizon ...

of fact, let me take a picture of that phenomenon

eyeball and try to put it in the same place each

make these measurements. You can't expect to mmke
these measurements without using any fuel. It's

and bring it down to the horizon keeping the horizon
and the star in your field of view.

48 51 50 CC Okay. 47 ft/sec out of your forward-firing. That's l+18. 120 ft/sec out of the aft. That's 2+31. At 17 42 53. 2+48. 8+49. And the 33-1 time without burn: 17 36 33- 7+36. 4+58. Correction on that last 14+58. Want to read those back to me?
48 52 44 C Houston, Gemini 4. I didn't get either one of
those. Say again.
48 52 51 CC Okay. 47 ft/sec and l+18 on your forward-firing. 120 ft/sec and 2+31 on your aft-firing, at 17 42 53- 2+48. 8+49.
48 53 16 C Roger. Got 'em. Go ahead with the other one.
48 53 18 CC Okay. Without burn: 17 36 33- 7+36. 14+,_8-

Page 227
48 53 33 C Okay. Got them that time.
48 53 36 CC Okay. If you will turn your computer on, we'll
give you an update.
48 53 44 C Roger. Computer coming on.

Section TEXAS

48 53 56 CC Jim, we'd like you to make a Main Battery Check, if
you would, please.
48 54 00 C Roger. We are making a Mai_ Battery Check, right
nOW.
48 54 03 CC Okay.
48 54 20 C Okay, we got computer light - running light on.
You can go ahead.
48 54 24 CC Okay. Computer light on.
48 54 43 CC Okay, on your D-9 Experiment.
48 54 50 C Roger.
48 54 52 CC Okay, we'd like for you to try to see stars on the
daylight side with the earth shine and not in view.
Just forget the sextant; Just get dark adapted the
best you can on the daylight side and see if you
can pick out some stars.
48 55 09 C Roger, we tried that and we can't - we were not
able to pick out any stars on the daylight side.
48 55 15 CC Okay. Then we'd like to know what filters were
satisfactory on the sextant.
48 55 24 C Okay. We have some notes on that. Listen, I th_k
on the 33rd Rev, if at _11 possiblej I'd like to take
those ... shots across the Southwestern United
States on Rev. 5.
48 55 40 CC Roger.
48 55 42 C I said, I sure would like to get that out of the way.
48 55 45 CC Okay, we'll run it through out Flight Plan section
here and let you know.
48 55 49 C Okay, I think it would be foolhardy to run any more
D-9 Experiments in the daylight, because that is
hopeless.

Page 228
48 56 01 CC Okay, fine. Coming over the States here at G.m.t.
of 16:ll, they'_ like you to make some weather
pictures. There're some thundershowers up north
of us.
48 56 10 C Okay.
48 56 11 CC I guess you've already passed that now. Maybe you
can get 'em next time around.
48 .5618 C A]q right. Ed was taking some pictures. I don't
know what he was taking pictures of, though.
48 56 23 CC Okay.
48 56 24 C I think he got some terrain pictures.
48 56 28 CC Okay. Are you ready for your little news release?
48 56 31 C Roger.
48 56 33 CC Okay. All of the big headlines, of course, are
still about what you are doing and particl,qarly
about seeing that satellite up there yesterday.
Also, the conversation with the wives is getting
a big play.
48 56 49 C Okay.
48 56 51 CC Things in Vietnam have quieted down, and not too
much going on over there right now.
48 56 57 c okay.
48 56 59 CC The Oilers are going to play in the Rice Stadium
instead of the Domed Stadium.
48 57 03 C They are!
48 57 04 CC Yes. Apparently they couldn't get together on the
rental price. Bud Adams was quoted as saying that
the Dome may be the eighth wonder of the earth, but
the rental price is surely the ninth wonder.
48 57 15 C Aw, shucks! Hey, Gus, have you tried to figure out
what I saw out there over Hawaii and Guaymas?
48 57 24 CC Have you figured it out? You saw it.
48 57 27 C I don't know. I took a picture of it but the sun
came across the window right after I saw it. I
only ... t5 seconds.
48 57 35 CC I haven't heard any more about it, Jim. We'll look
into it.
48 57 37 C Okay.

Page 229
48 57 38 CC You have a valid load, and you can turn your computer
off now. That gives you a TR time of 36-4 in
the computer.
48 57 50 C Very good.

Section CAPE KENNEDY

48 58 07 CC Hey, Jim. Gemini 4, CAP COM.
48 58 12 C Roger. Go ahead.
48 58 19 CC Near as we can tell, the only satellite it could be
would be Pegasus, from what we note here.
48 58 21 C That's what I thought it might be, too.
48 58 29 CC Okay.
48 58 31 CC Hey. The Astros did beat the Cards yesterday,
5 to 2. They're still in sixth place though.
48 58 37 C Okay. He's got this information for you.
48 58 39 CC Go ahead.
48 58 40 P The batteries were 9 and 22.5.
48 58 44 CC Roger. 9 and 22.9-
48 58 47 P All the rest of the electrical readings are up.
48 58 50 CC Say again.
48 58 51 P The rest of the electrical readings are normal.
48 58 53 CC Okay. Fine.
48 59 06 CC Next time you bleed down your primary oxygen pressure,
bring it all the way down to about 800 psi.
We can't find much else that we can do about the
thing. Just bring it down lower so you are working
through a wider band. We don't think that is going
to cause you to use any.
48 59 28 C Roger. Bring it down. Listen, I Just then ran the
thing up to about 5 1/4, and I'm trying to hold it
at 5 1/4 with the Repress ... hold it. If not,
I'll bring it down to around 800.
48 59 40 CC Okay. We think you can go way down in your pressure
now without hurting anything, so if it gets to be a
nuisance Just bring it on down so that you don't have
to watch it so close and be bothered with it too much.

Page 230
48 59 52 C ...
48 59 57 CC I can't _-ead you ver_y good right now. Wait until
we get to Bermuda again, will you?
49 00 01 C Okay.
49 00 20 C At about 16:03, as we came across on this last pass,
across the Gulf of California, the Mexico side._ we
were in a perfect small-end-forward dow___tt_i'tude
so I took a series of seven or eight photographs of
the terrai n ... stereographic ...
49 00 41 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
49 00 44 C Go ahead, Houston. This is Gemini 4.
49 00 50 CC Roger. Could you give us an estimate as to how far
that satellite was from you yesterday?
49 00 57 C I couldn't really tell. It looked like quite a
large object, and it looked like I was closing on
it rather' l_lpidly. Distance is rather hard to
judge. I'd say 10 miles or so.
49 01 10 CC iO miles?
49 01 11 C That's just a guess. I really can't tell. I was
close enough where I could see -
49 01 19 CC You were close enough to see what?
49 01 21 C ... arms and cylindrical things sticking out.
49 01 26 CC You're cutting up pretty badly, there. I couldn't
read that.
49 01 30 C Okay.
49 01 31 CC Well, that came througi_ good.
49 01 33 C All right. I said, I got close enough to it ...
49 01 39 CC Close enough to it to what?
49 01 41 C ...
49 01 44 CC Well, as near as we can tell, there wasn't anything
that close to you. Pegasus was about 1200 miles
away.
49 01 49 C No, it wasn't quite that close --that far away.
49 01 57 CC Pretty good eyeballs, all right.
49 01 59 C Well, I took a picture of it. I just hope it comes
out.

Page 231
49 02 03 CC So do we.
49 02 05 C Unfortunately -
49 02 11 CC Are you using VOX, because you are cutting out.
49 02 14 C No, I'm using continuous interphone, PL_H-TO-T_
How do you read me now?
49 02 17 CC Good. Every now and then the last part of your
sentence cuts off.
49 02 22 C Okay, maybe I have a weak thumb. Listen, would you
ask the doctors if it's okay if I use this exerciser?
49 02 29 CC If you use it?
49 02 30 C ... but I'd st1]1 like to get more exercise than
I'm getting.
49 02 39 CC Sure, go ahead.
49 02 40 C Okay.
49 02 42 CC Just let us know how much you use it, if you w_ll?
49 02 44 C I sure wi11. But I -
49 02 47 CC It's okay. Go ahead and use it.
49 02 49 C OW_y, use it ...
49 02 52 CC Say again.
49 02 54 C Can I use it -
49 02 58 CC You're cutting out again. Go ahead and say again.
49 03 00 C May I use the exerciser like the M-3 exercise?
49 03 07 CC Affirmative.
49 03 09 C Okay. Thank you.
49 04 45 CC Gemini 4, CAP CO_
49 04 48 C Roger. Go ahead.
49 04 49 CC Do you have a time _J%ckat the exact time you saw
the satellite?
49 04 54 C No_ I do not. I called it out on the radio. It
ought to be on the tape.
49 05 00 CC Okay.
49 05 03 C I also put it on the voice recorder in here, so we
can go back and look for it.
49 05 07 CC Okay. But at the eEact time you saw it, you put it
on tape?

Page 232
49 05 13 C That's right.
49 05 15 CC On the radio?
49 05 16 C Roger.
49 05 26 CC Hey, Jim.
49 05 28 C Go ahead.
49 05 30 CC Why do you want to use the exerciser? Are you
feelin stiff, cramped, or what?

49 05 38 C ... been in orbit two days, and haven't ...
49 05 42 CC It's garbled. I couldn't read it.

you've got, or do you think you'll need some more?
50 37 34 C No, I don't think we're getting an awful lot of rest
out of it, but on the other hand, we're not doing
much so we're really not too tired. I think we'll
go th_ough this next pass, and Ed'll go back to

on the Synoptic Terrain Photography, starting a
little bit east of San Diego and until we ran into
the cloud co_rage again. We picked up with intermittent
pictures as soon as we started over the
southern part of the United States down around
Alabam_ and Mississippi and on across to Florida.
We got some very good pictures of the weather in
that area, then we got some pictures of the air
fields around Jacksonvt]le. We took a couple of

Page 238
pictures of the Cape. Probably one of the best
pictures we got was one shooting back, and we got
the whole weather formation along the coastline
starting with Florida and going all the w_y back to
Texas. A very well defined line of weather following
closely to the coastline. Then we took so_
pictures of the weather formation in the State of
Florida, around Cuba and the island area, and into
the gulf ... weather build-ups, clouds, and we
took a couple of pictures of the island, some very
good pictures. We ended up taking up 55 pictures.

52 29 43 P Okay.
52 29 57 P If I could find the horizon, I got it hacked. I
got the star, and I got the blue filter on. It cut
everything out except my star, pretty we] ]. But I
haven't got down to the horizon yet.
52 30 26 P This thing, I think, could do with an eye stabilization.
52 30 29 C Yes, I think it can too, Ed. I said that ...
... looked like .;v.: too...
52 30 41 C Hey, am I down. too low? I've got a lot of horizon

52 31 53 P The green filter I ha'_ cut out. m_st of the airglow.
52 31 57 P It leaves :ne a little tiny band. And it's pretty
hard to measure from.
52 32 07 C Why don't you get that hand and see what kind of
angles you get?
52 32 09 P Well, I want to try. I don't think I ought to use
that filter.

52 33 57 C That will hold, maybe ... a little better.
52 34 02 P We found out that the filters aren't too good.
52 34 05 C Yes, I planned on playing a lot around with the
filters, just themselves when you were sleeping.
The next thing I was going to do, I was just going
to get the sextant out and play with the filters
and stuff.

53 17 34 S Gem_nj 4, Surgeon, CSQ SImge,n_. Would1 you re,at
your eating?
53 21 21 P I'd like to comment a little on the sextant. Its
use in a cramped spacecraft is very difficult,
particularly with the helmet on. I finally decided
it was going to be useless with your helmet on to
try to take the angles that the stars, that were
being called for, required. So I took my helmet
off. This gave me a little more flexibility in
using it, but still I was limited to angles of about
20 to 23Â° without maneuvering the sDacecraft. What
would happen if the star would be cut out by the
upper part of the window. Now, by more frequent
and liberal maneuvering of the spacecraft you could
maneuver it so that you _,ave the long axis of the
window in your tracking plane. We were somewhat
limited by fuel and we didn't choose to maneuver in
this manner. We used Pulse Mode, too, without a
lot of maneuvers. The stars that were selected for
that run were ones that had rather high angles _o
the horizon and, therefore, were very difficult to
get. We finally decided to go ahead and get the
stars a little closer to the horizon. I ran a
couple on Canopus and a couple of others, as you'll
notice. The blue filter seemed to block out the
horizon totally; I didn't have any horizon when I
used that. Our horizon image probably is not as
good when there is moonlight. The green filter,
though, gave me w_hat I would consider a little
clearer horizon than ! had with no filter at all.
I felt there was not a difficulty in making these
measurements with either the green or clear filter.
Still, the horizon is not very well defined and you
have to kind of standardize yourself and measure on
the same part of the horizon t_hat you did before to
get some type of a standard measurement. To me it
was easier to measure with no filter to the top of
the airglcw. With the green filter I liked to
measure the bottom of the airglow.

over the States. It looks like we're going to be
pretty busy up there at that time. We'll be alining
the platform and doing MSC-iO at the same time.
67 15 24 CC Okay, I'll tell them not to bother you too much.
67 15 54 CC Okay, we've got to turn your platform ON.

67 27 13 C Gemini 4, again. I see the same sort of curv_ of
lights, like the northern lights except they are
below us, and I saw them another time, they were
great big long lines. Looks like they run about
parallel to the direction of our flight path and
they extend from Just below the airglow in the
earth's horizon, up a little bit past the top of
the airglow. The same thing I saw the other night
except, that _l.'n nnt quttc ns bright as it was then.

70 18 02 CO Okay, very good. I'll -_ke a _k_licalPass Type 1
on the Pilot at Texas at 14 13 15.
70 18 14 C Say, listen. Ed hasn't been to sleep yet. He's
just about to go to sleep and I think it would be
better for him to go to sleep than to have a Medical
Data Pass. How about a medical pass on him right now?
70 18 29 CC How about putting the oral temp probe in his mouth
and get on pumping up that gage on that blood
pressure?
70 18 59 CC Command Pilot, Carnarvon.
70 19 02 C Go ahead.
70 19 04 CC Did you check any MDIU quantities while the computer
was powered up?
70 19 08 C No, we didn't.

7+41. 14+29.
72 36 33 C Got it.
72 36 34 CC Okay. Now I've got quite a bit of information to
pass up to you here. We would like for the Pilot,
who is asleep, to leave his face-plate open and his
gloves off. And then we would like for the Pilot
that is awake to take off his helmet and gloves and
use the light-weight headset for con_inucations if
he can. And we would like for you to continue this
way up until about 3 hours prior to retrofire. Then,
once in orbit, at your convenience, we would like
for you to take a wet and dry bulb reading and just
at any station give us a report of what it was and
what time you took it.
72 37 24 C Okay. We have been operating with the face-plate
open and gloves off now for about the last 12 hours,
but mostly in that situation we kept oversleeping.
When we sleep we generally close the visor and put
... cover t_._ight out of our eyes.

72 37 47 C The humidity stays do_m around _0 percent.
72 37 52 CC Roger. Okay, Jim, we decided tt_t you've got a little
bit of fuel left that we can play with here in the
Flight Plan. We would like for you to go to the
Horizon Scan Mode for the next 8 hours. That's at
an elapsed time of about 80:30, and we want you to
use the Primary Scanner. We don't want you to do
any controlling in yaw, and if the scanner breaks
lock, don't control in roll or pitch either. We
Want to see - if it breaks lock, we would like to
see if it will reacquire.
72 38 33 C Okay. You want the horizon scanners on for the next
8 hours.
72 38 36 CC Affirmative.
72 38 38 C 80 hours elapsed time.
72 38 39 CC Roger.
72 38 41 C Okay, Gus. For flight planning purposes, we haven't
been able to do much with D-9, because we haven't
been u_ing the fuel for it. We ought to save a
little fuel to do that.
72 38 51 CC Okay. We got no problem. Go ahead and use your
D-9. Now, on the Apollo Iandmark no. 2_ we would
like for you to be in attitude for tb_t at 17: 19.
O.m.t. of 17:19. And the landmark wilt be 16 m_les
north of track, and you should be pitched down about
minus 30Â° at that time. And we would like for you
to track this as close as possible and to get some
pictures using the 16-mm camera with 75-_m lenses
with a nominal lens setting.
72 39 32 C Roger. Wi11 do.
72 39 34 CC Do you want me to repeat any of that?
72 39 36 C Negative. Apollo no. 2 at 17: 19. 16 miles north
of track. Pitch is down about 3 OÂ° and use the 75-mm
lenses at that time.
72 39 45 CC Roger, and really have at it and track it close.
Use your reticle.
72 39 48 C Okay.

Page 298
72 39 50 CC Okay. Your Orbit Nav Runs 9 and 10 do as scheduled
in the Flight Plan. Do it Just as you previously
planned to do it. Just for information, 9 is scheduled
at an elapsed time of 7_:30 and lO at 75:50.
72 40 13 C Okay. We wtll do Orbit Nay Runs 9 and 10 as scheduled
at 75:30 and 75:50.
72 40 18 CC Roger. We are going to come up with some more
tracking tasks for you, I think, and we want most
of them to be done pretty tight.
72 40 27 C Okay. Very good.
72 40 29 CC Okay, I have a map update for you if you want it now.
72 40 33 C Okay. Go ahead.
72 40 35 CC Okay. 1700 East, G.m.t. is 17 00 OO. That's Rev 47.

Quantity Read OFF and the computer OFF?
72 41 30 C Yes. I'm getting them now.
72 41 32 CC Okay.
72 41 35 CC Okay, now Flight would like to know if you are going
to try sleeping with your helmet off. Try sleeping
with your face-plate open, I'm sorry.
72 41 49 C I don't know. The sun really gets in your eyes, Gus.
I don't think we'll try that. Ed has tried sleeping
witn his helmet up and then down and right now he
just slipped it up. He's having a tough time with
the sun. I tried it_ and I can't do it.
72 42 05 CC Okay. Can you just put the shade over anyway?
72 42 10 C Yes. He '$ sleeping with it about half open. How
about that?
72 42 13 CC Okay.

Page 299
72 42 17 C Actually the last 12 hours or mcre, ._aybe as much
as 24, we haven't been too careftal about keeping
our face-plate closed and our ... bands up because
obviously, the humidity isn't going up.
72 42 28 CC Yeah. Well, of course, that is what we are trying
to do. We are trying to get a good hack on what is
happening there. Maybe we don't have a problem like
we originally thought.
72 42 37 C Yes. I don't think we do. Essentially, Ed hasn't
had his face-plate closed for the last 12 hours,
and I only had mine closed when I was sleeping.
72 42 44 CC Okay. Well, go ahead and do what we asked as near
as you can and give us those wet and dry bulbs so
we can get a good spot on this thing.
72 42 54 0 OWay. I have been r_mning them right along and our
temperatures are r,_,nnfngabout ' the dry bulbs are
_mning 72 and 7_, the wet bulbs between 60 and 64.
The relative h_,mtdity stands pretty close to around
60 percent.
72 43 08 CC Ve_ good.
72 43 10 C Yes. And there is no visible moisture. And there
isn't any moisture around that blotting paper. Unfortunately,
you covered up the walls so that I
can't take the temperature, but the worst temperature
I can find is about 65.
72 43 24 CC Roger.
72 43 36 CC Jim, the Flight Surgeon wonders if he can say anything
about your eyes. Have you had any problems?
Any drying or anything at all?
72 43 49 C Yes. Listen, I had a lot of trouble with my eyes
at the end of the first day. I wasn't sure I was
going to be able to hack it. But they Pave cleared
up now. I think our little problem was taken care
of by the suit heat exchanger.
72 43 58 CC Okay. You don't have any problem at all now with
them?
72 44 01 C No problem at all. Though it was really bad between
about 18 and 36 hours.
72 44 09 CC Roger, understand. Anything else?
72 44 13 C No. We are pretty well.

84 47 04 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston. We would like information
on what D-9 has been accomplished.
84 47 14 C Roger, understand. You'd like infor,vation on what
D-9 Experiment has been accomplished.
84 47 19 CC That's affirmative. _he run numbers that you b_ve
completed and also what stars you are _msing for the
Apollo D-9.

Page 331
84 47 26 C Roger. Stand by one, please. On the Apollo D-9
Run 4 we _ad Antares and Scorpli. And we ._nde a
long run on that one and a short one. We ,made also
a run on Antares and the third order magnitude star
in Scorpio. We made mo Apollo star to booster sightings.
We have made three Air Force D-9 runs.
Houston, Gemini 4. Are you reading?
84 48 31 CC This is Houston. Reading you loud and clear and
understand you have made three Air Force D-9's. an
Apollo no. 4 on Antai-es and one of the stars in
Scorpio, a 10ng and a shcrt run. You got a long
Antares and the third magnitude on Scorpio. Right?
84 48 47 C Roger. The two stars in Scorpio are Scorpii and
Antares. Those are the ones about 21Â° apart.
84 48 55 CC Roger, I copied those.
84 48 58 C And the Air Force ])-9 run -- the way they're laid
out is difficult to run. We got some runs though,
in different order and accomplished basically the
informatiom that they wanted in D-9.
84 49 12 CC Understand. You basically accomplished what the
Air Force wanted. We'll analyze this in Flight
Plan and try to get you a final update for D-9.
84 49 21 C Roger, understand. Thank you.
84 49 33 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston. Did you have any luck
tracking Pegasus B on that CSQ pass?
84 49 39 C Negative. I had to come down for that tape dump
and when I went back up I didn't have any luck.
The sun was just about 900 also. And there's a
lot of stuff on the outside of mY window which makes
a lot of reflection. Very difficult to see.
84 49 56 CC Roger. On your fuel status: latest analysis looks
like we're Just going to have enough to complete the

85 35 01 C Hello Houston, Gemini 4.
85 35 04 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM, Put your Tape
Playback Switch to RESET, please.
85 35 10 C Roger, going to RWMET.

Page 334
85 35 13 CC Roger. I'd like to give you a little briefing what we came up with for the terminal reentry maneuver. Are you copying me clearly?
85 35 34 C ...
85 35 36 CC Okay. We looked at all the possible possibilities
down here. About the worst case we could come up
with is your 3-sigma error miss distance --worst
case 70 nautical miles. That's 70. What we wom_ _
like to have you do is an 0A__ retro naneuver_ then
we will have a manual retrofire, of course, with no
computer. We want a zero-lift, rolling reentry.
That's zero-lift, rolling reentry. The reason for
the decision on the rolling versus a 90-90 bank is
that there's less chance of dispersions. They will
tend to eqnallze out. We feel we can have a faster
recovery that way. Also, doing it that way we can
get an IP prior to your blackout and you should pull
about 8g's on that reentry. Do you copy?
85 36 43 C Roger. Understand a ,_ximum D-sigma miss distance
of 70 nautical miles, an OA_ retro, a manual retrofire,
a zero-lift rolling, I got a faster recovery,
be able to plot point of impact.
85 37 10 CC Roger. You got all of that. Now this zero-lift
rolling only applies to your terminal maneuvers.
All your CIA's and PLA's onboard are still the 60Â°
hank.
85 37 22 C Roger, understand.
85 37 25 CC Okay. I have a D-9 update for you. It's a Run
no. l, Revolution 99 and 56. Start time 05 48 45,
use stars of opportunity.
85 37 50 C Roger. Rev 55, and no. 1, start time 05 48 55 and
say the last part.
85 37 57 CC That st'rt time is O9 48 45, use stars of opportunity.
85 38 04 C Stars of opportunity?
85 38 17 CC Gemini 4, I did not get your last transmission. I
_y again, use stars of opportunity.
85 38 24 C Roger, star_ of opportunity.
85 38 26 CC Okay, do you have any questions you would like the
ground to answer with regards to your reentry?

Page 335
85 38 48 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston. We passed u_: tkis reentry
so you two could talk it over and come %ack
later on if you have any questioas. For your information,
the 63-1 weather forecast looks like
about 3- to 4-foot waves with 18 knots of wind,
visibility and ceiling will be good.
85 39 10 C Roger, understand. Was that an Apollo 9 or D-9 for
that Rev SD?
85 39 17 CC That is a D-9 Run no. 1. Stand by and I'll get
further clarification.

There will be three steps to this check. First
step: put 10 ft/sec in all IVI windows. Then push
the M-l function Reset. Then press the Start Comp
and watch for a Computer R,_ning Light indication.
You will do this in all modes. If you do not - I
repeat - do not get an indication of computer _muing,
then you will perform another test. In this other
test, you w111 check in all modes. You w_ll turn
the computer OFF for 2 seconds - the Computer power
OFF for 2 seconds. After the computer has been repowered,
repress the man_l Malfunction Reset and
also Start Comp. If you get a Computer _muing
Ligh_ in any mode, discontinue this 2-second power
off. Do you copy?
88 18 14 C Roger. Computer check of all modes. Insert
10 ft/sec in all %he M,s_ push the MAlfunction
Light, and push the Start Comp button ... is
... turn the computer OFF for 2 seconds, repower
and depress the M_]function Light. If we get those
... at any time, well, we should discontinue the
test.
88 19 55 CC Roger. That's affi_u_ative. We're standing by here

88 40 54 CC I think everybody else is thinking the same thing.
88 57 24 C I Just made a run on Target 16-A. The air field at
Basra, it's right at the Persian Gulf. I picked it
up -- I picked the Persian Gulf up about ... an
angle of about 30Â° ... I pitched down then
picked up the lake ... northwest of the Persian
Gulf. Basra being right on the lakes, very near
the lakes, you can Just follow over and pick up the
airfield right away. So I got the airfield out quite
a ways before I got to the target, and then Just
started tracking on the target. I was act1,-1ly on
the target by the ttme I was still 20Â° from the
vertical, I would guess - and tracked it on out from
the runway to about the 400 point past it, and I
stopped tracking. I had this 75-_..,,lens on the
16-mm camera with the adapter on it to take pictures
out the forward end and I had it running from the
last experiment ... for the target -
89 21 55 C Well, we saw Australia for the first time in the
daylight. First passed up Basra then across the
islands of India. On across India to _laysia and
on across to Australia ... we certainly -- only
passed about half so far.
89 22 12 C I've seen an awful lot of North Africa ... daylight
-- know quite well. I've just completed D-9
Apollo Landmark run on Target 14. I had a very
good pickup. I had seen the target before; I knew
where it was. I got right on the thing about 30Â°
below the horizon and got on the area, and picked
up the specific target at about 20_, 30Â°from the
vertical. Got on the target at about 30Â° from the
vertical and then tracked it to the vertical and
then back off ... back up, straight on, and then
back up.

90 02 54 C Very good, very good. I was wondering what you were
going to do about that.
90 02 56 CC Yes, we've been holding on to that for a while and
thought we'd surprise you. Here's Jim.
90 03 01 CC Gemini 4, this is Shakey here.
90 03 05 C Hello Shakey here, how are you?
90 03 06 CC Fine. Listen, what are your feelings on a rolling
reentry versus the 900 bank angle? We're recomm-ndlng
a rolling here.
90 03 15 C Yes, it's not very !maginative, but it gets the job
done. So why don't we go ahead with it?

Page 341
90 03 19 CC Roger. Here is the fo_._at which we'll send up to
you for a rolling reentry. We'll give you the AV
and _ for your _'_ b_. We'll give you the G_RC.
We'll give you a RET of .05g. And then you wtlt
also get the RET of drogue, of main, and of landing.
Your procedure will be at retro to go to full lift,
heads down. At the RET of .O_g you will go into a
15Â° roll rate. When you reach 100 OOO, when the
altimeter comes off the peg, go to f_,ll lift. How
does that sound to you, Jim?
90 04 12 C Roger. I think I've blocked part of you out. Right
after retrofire we go to full lift and at .05g, or
at that time, we go to 15 deg/sec and at 100 000 we
go to f_lll lift again.
90 04 25 CC That's right. The only difference between the format
before is that instead of the BET of 400 000
we ,11 give you .05g RET when you start your roll
rate.
90 04 37 C Okay, tt.at sounds good.
90 04 39 CC This will give you a trim angle into the atmosphere,
a roll rate, and then fill1 lift at 100 000 again for
your drogue and main deploy.
90 04 47 C Okay, very good.
90 04 50 CC Shades of _ercury, Jim.
90 04 53 C I was going to say I'll bet you Flight Directors
were thinking of this one.
90 04 58 C That's why I say not very imaginative, but I guess
it gets the Job done.
90 05 03 CC Roger. i have a bet with your wife that y0_i'li get
within _ mt!es. Now you've got to hold up my end
here.
90 05 11 C Okay. I'm going to try to hold up my end, too.
Remember when I said we'd never make a closed
looper?
90 05 19 CC Doesn't look like we'll make one this time.
90 05 21 C Yes.
90 05 28 CC Hey, Jim, we're still going to pass you your updates
for 60 thxough 64-4 with the bank angles in. Just
the same as we've been passing them, with the exception
of 63-1.

the ball --should be 27Â° nose above the horizon.
And this wolLldbe out the window, which would be
23Â° .
96 09 10 P Roger. 23Â° out the window. On the ball, 270 nose
up.
96 09 20 CC What are your attitudes now?
96 09 22 P Zero, zero, zero.
96 09 25 CC Very good.
96 09 26 C I Just started to aline the platfor_
96 09 28 CC Roger. Okay, Jin_ What control modes are you going
to use for the reentry?
96 09 33 C Well, let's try Reentry Rate Comn_nd. I was going
to do that anyway, and then I decided we complan't
do it because we didn't have the response, but since
we don't need to pmrticularly ... I'll use Reentry
Rate Comm_d.
96 09 48 CC Roger. You're going to hold roll in, or are you
going to turn your roll rate gyros off?
96 09 52 C Tuzm the gyro off.
96 09 54 CC Okay, fine.
96 10 03 CC Okay. You wa_t your time to 50 000 to drogue deploy
and to splash?
96 10 09 C Roger.
96 10 11 CC Okay. 10+55 to drogue deploy, and 17+lO to splash.
96 10 19 C Roger. How about main chute?
96 10 23 CC We don't have that one yet.
96 10 25 C Roger. 10+55 to drogue, 17+55 to splash, and standing
by for chute.
96 10 36 CC In case you don't get your complete _ burn, advance
your retrofire time by 2 seconds for each second
that you're short of your OA_ burn.
96 10 51 C Only 2 seconds?
96 10 52 CC Roger. Two for one.
96 10 55 C Okay. It used to be three for one. What happened?

Page 354
96 10 59 CC No, it never w_s, Jim.
96 11 02 C It was about a week ago.
96 11 06 CC This is a new week.
96 11 11 CC Yes. Remember this is delta time now, not delta
velocity.
96 11 16 C Roger.
96 11 18 CC On your checklist, when you pulled your drogue pins,
did you lin,11your seat pins also?
96 11 25 C Roger. We weren't there yet. We'll get them, though.
96 11 34 CC Do you have everything stowed?
96 11 36 C Yes. We 'ye got everything stowed as well as we can
stow it.
96 11 38 CC Okay. The weather in your recovery area is scattered
clouds, you've got 10 knots of wind and 4-foot waves.
It couldn't be better.
II c Roger.
96 11 47 CC Okay. The doctors want to talk to you here just a
second.
C Okay.
S Jim? Both of you are in real good shape at the
present time and all the EKG's look Just fine. Your
water intake has come up real well and from my last
computation here, both of you appear to be really
well hydrated for the reentry. I'd like to make sure
that both of you feel completely rested. Is that
affirmed?
C Oh, we're a little tired, but we're as rested as we
Can be.
96 12 21 S All right, Jim. Do you feel that there's any need
for item bravo?
96 12 25 C Negative.
96 12 28 S Negative. Okay. I'd like to review with you this
blood pressure. You are not going to have the adapter
on until after you're on the w_ter. Ed already
has it on, and we can tell from the data. He's to
get one blood pressure after retro, one on the chute
before bridle, one after bridle, and then both of
you every 15 rLinutesin the water. Affirm?

We still - Just to reaffirm - you would like no
more than that i hour in the spacecraft. Get youasuits
off, at your discretion, if the spacecraft
has no leak. The open hatch part is strictly your
decision. It looks good in the recovery area at the
present time for this. Remember the pump_ exercise
that we did at the tl-_ of the physical, and
the feet up would be the preferable way. .axe there
any questions about this at all?
96 14 10 C No questions.
96 14 12 S Roger. We'] ] look forward to seeing you on the
Carrier, then. Surgeon out.

again. Get your Contro!_er and stuff out.

Page 366
96 54 41 c ... pick up early. I don't want to get seasick.
96 54 45 P I don't either.
96 54 47 C Hey, you got a couple up there you probably ought to
get out of there.
96 54 49 P Okay.
96 54 51 C You all right?
96 54 57 P Start your burn. It's 16 44 01.
96 54 59 C 16 44 O1. All right.
96 55 01 P Retro time 16 56 01 or mtuus 12.
96 55 31 C 2+40 is 0AMS Retro. Right? Is it not?
96 55 37 C How are we going to handle that clock time? Are
you going to countdown for me?
96 55 40 P Yes.
96 55 42 C I'll Just fly away, and then when we get down to
2:30, you give me a mark when we've been gone through
30 mtnutes.
96 55 47 P I'l_ talk to you Just as we go along. I'll give you
a m_rk at 1-2-30-20-10 and count. OkayT
96 55 54 C Okay. Why don't you give me a mark at the end of
a minute.
96 55 57 P Yes.
96 55 59 C At the end of 2 minutes, then start counting down
from 30 when I've got 30 seconds to go. Tell me
30 seconds, 20 seconds, 10 seconds, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. .
96 56 09 P That's e_ctly what I said. That's good.
96 56 11 C I Just wanted to make sure that that's what you said.
96 56 13 P Right.okay.
96 56 15 C After so many clocks that we've been talking about.
96 56 28 C How long is it to RET? To 400 K7 2+38? Seems
awfully short.
96 56 34 P Yes.
96 56 35 P You sure you're looking at the right one?
96 56 37 P Positive.
96 56 40 c okay.
96 56 49 P We've had lot of them read up to us that short.

Page 367
96 56 51 C Yes, I guess we did. But none of them were over
there. The 0AP_ retro is always a lot shorter.
96 56 57 P Oh, yes. You're down.
96 57 40 C Don:t let me retrofire at 16Â°. Remember, it's 30Â°.
96 57 40 P Okay.
96 57 52 C Thsre's something about the amount of fuel that I
have shown on my quantity gage, and the amount of
retrofire that we got here, that Just doesn't figure
out.
96 58 01 P It should be higher.
96 58 04 C Yes, it looks like it. No, I mean on my GAM8
propellant.
96 58 06 P Oh, you mean - you mean--
96 58 09 C Quantity reading.
96 58 11 P Yes, you mean you feel we're going t_ burnout short.
96 58 15 C Yes.
96 58 18 C ... 42 percent. About 100 --120 pounds showing.
That doesn't allow any cushion. Well, if we burn,
out short, that means we're going to overshoot -
long. So we can adjust our retrofire time forward
2 sec/sec.
96 58 52 P Hey, you want to get a few th_ngs des_l ahem. You're
not going to use your FDI scale, are you? Want to
set it on HIGH?
96 58 59 C No, I'm going to use in on LOW for rate for the OAMS
retrofire.
96 59 02 P Okay.
96 59 11 C Ed ...
96 59 12 P You're going to fly ACME. Right?
96 59 14 C Going to fly ACME.
96 59 16 P Okay. And if you holler, I']_ give you a different
one.
96 59 20 C Yes, and I'm going to fly roll gyros in all three?
96 59 23 P Right, and I'll be watching when --
96 59 26 C You knock off the roll if it looks as though I need
it.

Page 368
96 59 33 C That sure w_s a peculiar way that thi_ was firing
out there. I was getting those yaw Jets everytime
I fired pitch.
96 59 49 P You didn't do that in DIRECT, did you?
96 59 52 C No, I didn't. Yes, I still got them in DIRECT.
96 59 53 P Did you?
96 59 55 C I turned the roll off. No, I turned the roll off
anM Just used pitch.

97 14 42 P At that time you'll put the Retro Power to ARM, but
we're going to move that up to the beginning so I
can indicate retro attitude.
97 14 49 P Okay.

97 19 08 C It has something to do with wetting your pants,
doesn't it?
97 19 11 C No, this is about the strongest I've ever smelled
it. We really screwed up when we went with this
