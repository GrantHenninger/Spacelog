00 08 23 CC Is it just slowly rotating?
00 08 25 C Roger, it's slowly rotating.
00 08 27 CC Roger, okay.
00 08 28 C It doesn't look big.
00 09 00 CC We'll lose you in about 30 seconds, Jim.

00 18 19 P Roger. Right now we're alining the platform and
it's going below our lower left, and we'll be going
down after it in a moment. We're after it right
now.
00 18 27 P We presently don't have it in sight; we aline the
platform.
00 18 31 C I have it sighted this time. It's directly below
me about 400 or 500 feet. I'm going to thrust
down ...
00 18 37 P Roger. We have it below us right now, exactly below
us at about 400 to 500 feet. The light is
coming through quite clearly.
00 18 44 CC Roger.
00 18 48 P We're passing over a big desert now.
00 18 59 C Canary, Gemini 4. Be advised there isn't enough

00 43 41 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
00 43 42 C Hello, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
00 43 44 CC Roger. Give me your status.
00 43 45 C Roger, we're GO. Everything looks great.
00 43 49 CC Roger, Gemini 4. You look good here on the ground.
Can you give me your battery readouts, please?
00 43 53 P Roger, stand by. Here they come.
00 44 20 CC Gemini 4, you can turn your radiator, --correction,
your secondary pump off. Your evaporators are normal.
Your radiator looks good.
00 44 27 P Roger. Evaporators NORMAL, and secondary pump A OFF.
Understand radiator looks good.
00 44 33 CC Okay. Give me about 10 seconds on your Quantity
Read Switch.
00 44 37 P Roger. Coming on.
00 44 39 CC Roger.
00 44 50 CC I'm standing by for your battery readouts.
00 44 59 CC While you're doing that, can the Command Pilot give
me a little information on the booster, the distance,
what you have to do to get that close to see it, and
how's the light working?
00 45 07 C Roger. The light's working fine. I can't tell exactly
how far it is though, I guess I'm probably a
half a mile or so. The booster started tumbling
right after we came off of it. I tried to dump the
rates down, and I got them down till it looked like
one-quarter degree per second but as soon as we got
off I got around to see it, it was tumbling.

	Page 9
00 45 25 CC Okay. How much delta-V did you use before you got there?
00 45 28 C I got about 30 ft/sec showing on my window there.
00 45 32 CC Okay.
00 45 34 C The booster fell away quite rapidly and got below
us like there was a considerable difference in our
velocity, and I let the thing get too far from me.
00 45 44 CC All right. Can you give me the battery readout?
If they look good I can give you a GO for 3-4.
... and we're standing by for a blood pressure from
the Pilot.
00 46 40 C Carnarvon, this is Gemini 4. I see lights of a town
below me.
00 46 44 CC Okay. 3, 2, 1-
00 46 48 CC MARK!
00 46 52 CC Did you get that time hack?
00 46 55 P Roger, got that time hack, and am standing by for the
delta-V up.
00 46 58 CC Go ahead.
00 46 59 P Roger. 1. 1-A and 2-B are 24, and they all look
good.
00 47 03 CC Roger.
00 47 04 P ... 1-A is 6. 1-B is 10. 1-C is 11. 2-A is 6.
6-B is 5, and 2-6 is 6.
00 47 13 CC Okay. Showing 24 on 2-A, B and C also?
00 47 16 P Roger. I'm getting 24 on all my adapter batteries.
00 47 19 CC Okay. Your readings are good.
00 47 22 P ... All checks out good.
00 47 23 CC Okay. Giving you a GO for 3-4, changing your TR time.
00 47 32 CC And I'm giving you a new load.
00 47 35 P We got the update coming in.
00 47 37 CC Okay, I've got the load ready, you got the new TR
time. We're standing by for that Pilot's blood
pressure. You ready to copy your update time?
00 47 42 P Roger, I copy the update time, ... the blood pressure.
00 47 47 CC Okay. 2-1. 170. 3+40. 01 32 39. 2+18. 8+32.
Over.

	Page 10
00 47 54 P Roger. We're coming up on the booster now, and you
can see the daylight starting to break. The lights
are quite visible, and I estimate that we're probably
in the vicinity of three-quarters of a mile from the
booster at the time now. The lights are very easy
to see, and the horizon is quite easily defined at
this time. We've unstowed the Contarex, the Hasselblad,
the 16-mm and the blood pressure cuff. We're
both finding that there is not as much velcro as we'd
like to have in the spacecraft. We feel like we need
more storage of loose items. Same thing that John
and Gus found.
00 48 10 P Roger. Say again the first four quantities, please.
00 48 13 CC I say, what you want repeated?
00 48 15 P Roger, the first four quantities.
00 48 17 CC 2-1: 170. 3+40. 01 32 39. Over.
00 48 36 P Roger. Would you say them with a little more pause
between them, please.
00 48 39 CC Does he want to try them again?
00 48 41 P Would you say them with more pause between the, ...
I ...
00 48 49 CC 2-1: 170. 3+40. 01 32 39. 2+18. 8+32. Over.
00 49 01 C This is Jim here. And I'm having a lot of difficulty
telling how far out I am from the booster. I can see
the two lights flash occasionally, and that's the
only thing that tells me where I am at all - as far
as distance with respect to the booster. I didn't
get the time to aline my platform well before I went
into ...
00 49 12 P Roger. Understand, I read you. 1: 170. 3+40. 01 32 34, 2+18. 8+30.
00 49 24 CC On your GETRC that's 01 32 39. Over. 9.
00 49 25 C Hello, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
00 49 30 P 01 32 39.
00 49 30 C Roger. We're GO. Everything looks great.
00 49 32 CC Roger, that's affirmative. Your orbit is about 86.8
by 150.6.
00 49 37 C Roger. Stand by. They're coming.

	Page 11
00 49 38 P Roger. 86.8 by 150.6. Sounds good.
00 49 42 CC Roger. We need that blood pressure on the Pilot.
00 49 44 P Roger, that will be coming up next.
00 49 45 C I'm going to ... a little bit more ...
00 49 45 CC And I'll need your accelerometer bias.
00 49 50 P You'll have to stand by for the accelerometer bias.
00 49 52 P Hand me the ... book, will you, Jim?
00 49 54 C The data book.
00 49 55 P Yes. I just can't keep the booster in sight and ...
00 49 58 CC Okay. You can give it to Guaymas.
00 50 00 C I'm afraid you'll have to wait for another orbit or
two.
00 50 01 CC All righty.
00 50 06 C Your light is on in case you're going to read it.
00 50 07 P Huh?
00 50 08 C Your lights are on.
00 50 09 P Yes.
00 50 18 C Roger. Evaporator NORMAL and Secondary Pump A OFF.
Understand everything looks good.
00 50 28 C Roger. Coming ON.
00 50 29 CC ...
00 50 37 P Blood pressure is coming in.
00 50 39 CC Roger.
00 50 52 P Roger.
00 51 01 P Why don't you do that, Jim?
00 51 02 C Roger. The light's working fine. I can't tell
exactly how far up I am from it. I guess I am
probably around a half a mile or so. The booster
started tumbling as we came off of it. I started
to damp the rates down, and I got them down to what
looked like a quarter degree per second, but as
soon as we came off and I got around to see it, it
was tumbling.
00 51 22 CC ...

	Page 12
00 51 25 C I've got about 30 ft/sec showing on my windows here.
The booster fell away quite rapidly and got below us
like there was a considerable difference in our velocities,
and I've been struggling here to not let
the thing get too far from me.
00 51 45 CC ...
00 52 06 P Roger. Your adapter battery readouts are coming at
you. They all are reading 24, 1-A through 1-C on
voltage. The amperes are 6 on 1-A, 10 on 1-B, 11 on
1-C, 6 on 2-A, 5 on 2-B, 6 on 2-C. The RCS rings
look good.
00 52 28 CC ...
00 52 36 P Roger.
00 52 48 C Carnarvon, this is Gemini 4. I'm seeing the lights
of the town below me.
00 52 53 CC ...
00 53 00 CC MARK!
00 53 01 P Roger. Got your time hack.
00 58 56 P We had a ring in one of our books come loose. It
looks like that would be pretty bad if they all got
loose - if they all came out of the card.
00 59 08 P My fingertip lights are right on my first knuckle
and it is making a sore spot on my center right
finger.
01 10 38 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM standing by.
01 10 51 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
01 11 06 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
01 11 14 C Go ahead, Houston, Gemini 4.
01 11 16 CC Roger, Gemini 4. Houston CAP COM standing by. I
read you slightly garbled.
01 11 22 C This is Gemini 4, Houston. ...
01 11 27 CC Standing by.
01 14 25 P It has a pretty good tumble rate. I'll try to time
it here.

	Page 13
01 14 37 P Makes about one complete revolution in about 8 seconds.
It's tumbling end over end. It looks like
now we're out a little further than we were before.
We've slipped out a little bit. I'd estimate it's
out about a mile and a half or maybe a little more.
It was really quite a view when we first saw it
down there. It looked like almost one of the artist's
conceptions. It was so vividly clear.
01 20 58 P Right now, we're in nose-to-the-ground type attitude,
such that I don't believe the ground stations are
able to read us. We have heard several calls cut in
and out for us. We're going to stay in this attitude
though for a while to keep the booster in sight. It
doesn't appear that we're making too much progress
in closing with the booster right now. It looks like
it's staying out about the same distance as it was
before. During the night sight when the booster was
below us, it appeared that there was almost a sky
full of stars. There was so much of the venting
coming off the booster and into the sky. In fact,
I commented on it that they looked like they were
stars. When you look closely at the booster at that
time, you could see the fuel -- actually the white
vapors coming out of the aft end of the booster, and
I guess that was spreading the little fireflies all
around. It was to such an extent though, it covered
the whole visible area in front of us.

	Section GUAYMAS

01 27 57 P Hello, Guaymas. This is Gemini 4.
01 27 59 CC Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
01 28 00 P Roger, Guaymas. We still have the booster. We're
out quite a ways from it now, and it's taking a little
more fuel than we had anticipated. We've got 61 in
the fore and aft window in the aft direction, 37 left
and 36 up at the present time. We appear right now
to be just about holding our own with it. Of course,
we should as we progress here. We should start to
close with it, but it's out further than we had hoped
to let it get right now.
01 28 24 CC Roger, I copy.
01 28 25 C Is there any way of giving me a quick check on what
my orbit is? This thing is way below me.

	Page 14
01 28 31 CC Say again.
01 28 32 C I said the booster is way below me. Could you tell
me my present orbit? As soon as possible.
01 28 43 CC Roger, we're working on it.
01 28 50 CC Gemini 4, we'll update you with the orbit calculations
some time after the pass over the States.
01 28 56 P Roger, I understand. And be advised our cabin pressure
seems to be holding just a hair below 5. It
stabilized down initially at 5.5, decreased to 5.25,
and then went back up to 5.5, and it's now down a
little below 5.
01 29 15 CC Roger. We copy.
01 29 16 P All right, you might get a confirmation for me on
that on the ground.
01 29 18 CC Roger. We're working on it. Put your Quantity Read
Switch to READ.
01 29 23 P Roger. It's going to READ.
01 29 34 C Guaymas, this is Gemini 4. We're going to have to
get a resolution right away whether you want me to
really make a major effort to close this last thing
or to save fuel.
01 29 44 C Guaymas, do you read Gemini 4?
01 29 46 CC Roger, we copy. We suggest you stand by. We want
to save the fuel.
01 29 51 C Okay. I guess it probably expended about 100 ft/sec.
01 29 56 C You expended 100 ft/sec?
01 30 01 C Yes, that's just a rough guess.
01 30 02 CC Roger. We're finished with the Quantity Read,
Gemini 4.
01 30 12 C Roger.
01 30 15 CC Place the Quantity Read Switch to --
01 30 16 C It's off.
01 30 51 CC Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM. Flight advises they like
to save the fuel. You'll be advised over the Cape.
01 31 01 C Well, I just can't wait till I get to the Cape. I
guess we're just going to have to watch it go away.
I've retrograded enough to help bring me down but I
don't want to get down to wherever it's going.

	Page 15
01 31 11 CC Roger.
01 31 13 CC Okay. I guess we'll scrub it.
01 31 16 C Okay. Can you give me a tag on my orbit as quick
as you can?
01 31 18 CC We're working on it.
01 33 00 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
01 33 02 C Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
01 33 04 CC Jim, we've estimated you've used about 50 percent
of your OAMS capability at this time.
01 33 10 C Roger. I think we ought to knock it off, Gus. It
keeps falling, it's probably three or four miles
away, and we just can't close on it.
01 33 16 CC Right, knock off. No more rendezvous with the
booster.
01 33 20 C Okay. Roger.
01 33 22 CC Okay. We're giving you a GO for your EVA at this
time.
01 33 25 C Okay. I would like to know what kind of an orbit
I'm in now.
01 33 30 CC We're working on it, but you may not get it until
we get to Canary.
01 33 34 C Okay.
01 33 36 CC Okay. I want to give you your 3-1, 3-4, 4-4 times
so tell me when you're ready to copy.
01 33 44 C Stand by 1.
01 33 45 CC Roger.
01 33 48 C Okay. Be advised I'm going to let the booster go
and not track it anymore. I'm going to aline the
platform and start conserving fuel.
01 34 01 P Go ahead. This is Gemini 4.
01 34 05 P Gemini 4 is ready to copy.
01 34 30 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
01 34 35 P Go ahead Houston. Gemini 4 is ready to copy.
01 34 37 CC Roger. 3-1: 171. 3+42. 18 19 03. 2+23. 8+42.
Do you want to read those back to me?
01 35 01 P Roger. 3-1: 171. 3+42. 18 19 03. 2+23. 8+42.

	Page 16
01 35 10 CC Roger. 3-4. Tell me when you're ready.
01 35 16 P Ready to go. Just keep shooting.
01 35 18 CC 120. 2+36. 19+34. 3+41. 9+47.
01 35 33 P Roger. 3-4 is 120. 2+36. 19 34 39. 3+41. 8+47.
01 35 42 CC Roger. 4-4: 134. 2+55. 21 08 03. 2+47. 8+30.
01 36 00 P Roger. 4-4 is 134. 2+55. 21 08 09. 2+46. 8+30.
01 36 09 CC Negative on the GMTRC. That is 21 08 03.
01 36 11 P Roger. 21 08 03.
01 36 20 CC Roger. All the rest is correct.
01 36 23 CC I have your onboard map update.
01 36 27 P Roger.
01 36 30 CC Ascending node 157 West. G.m.t. of ascending node is
16:34.
01 36 41 P Roger, I understand. Ascending node 157 West;
G.m.t. 16:34.
01 36 47 CC Roger. Could you give me some idea of what your
attitudes were over Carnarvon and Canton?
01 36 52 P Roger. We were nose-down tracking the booster and
I'm afraid that our attitudes were not so that we
could read with good reception on those stations.
01 37 05 CC Roger.
01 37 06 P They read us to some extent. Did they get the blood
pressure?
01 37 11 CC They didn't get a very good one, but you're going to
give another one around here some place, aren't you?
01 37 15 P Roger. Be advised the gun is out and stowed and
assembled and we've got out cameras and we'll be
going after the equipment.
01 37 22 CC Roger.

	Section BERMUDA

01 38 15 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
01 38 17 C Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
01 38 20 CC Would you go to PRELAUNCH on your computer. You
might give me your IVI readouts before you do.

	Page 17
01 38 24 C Roger. They were 20 aft and 76 up.
01 38 31 CC Roger. Are you in PRELAUNCH now?
01 38 32 C Roger. In PRELAUNCH now.
01 38 39 C I'm alining the platform.
01 38 40 CC Roger.
01 39 10 CC Gemini, we estimate you still have about 200 feet delta-V
left.
01 39 16 C Roger. That's what I've got.
01 39 17 CC Roger.
01 39 27 C CAP COM. Can you give us a G.m.t. time hack? I
missed it before.
01 39 33 CC Roger. I'll give you a G.m.t. at 16 56 00.
01 39 38 P Roger.
01 39 55 P CAP COM. I'd like a hack at 16 56.
01 40 01 CC Roger. It will be 3 more seconds.
01 40 05 CC MARK!
01 40 07 CC That was 16 56 04.
01 40 10 P Roger.
01 40 11 CC We have a new hack on your orbit. It's 89.5 over
158.6.
01 40 19 C Roger.
01 40 58 CC Can you go to READ momentarily?
01 41 01 C We're READ. Roger.

01 42 15 C Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4.
01 42 18 CC Gemini 4, go ahead.
01 42 20 C Roger. Do you want me to keep my platform and computer
up?
01 42 26 CC Turn off your READ switch now if you're reading.
01 42 30 C Okay. I understand you got the reading. Would you
advise me on the computer and IMU?
01 42 38 C I see no reason for it.
01 42 41 CC Keep your platform powered up, Jimmy boy.
01 42 43 C Okay.

	Page 18
01 42 58 CC Hey, Jim. We estimate you have 207 left in your
OAMS.
01 43 02 C Roger.
01 43 07 CC Okay. We'd like to have - are you still reading?
01 43 10 C Roger. Still reading you.
01 43 11 CC We'd like to get a blood pressure on Ed over the
Canaries.
01 43 15 C He's unstowing stuff right now so you may have to
wait a second.
01 43 20 CC Okay. We want it over the Canaries. You got a
little time yet.
01 43 26 C Roger. We'll be over there at 1:49, right?
01 43 39 CC Might be there a little sooner than that, I think.
01 43 41 C Okay.
01 43 47 C What was my G.m.t. at lift-off, CAP COM?
01 43 53 CC G.m.t. at lift-off was 15 15 59.
01 43 59 C Roger.
01 44 03 CC Have you checked your cabin seal?
01 44 11 C Roger. Our cabin is holding at about 4.9. What
else do you want to check?
01 44 17 CC Check your water seal.
01 44 19 C Water seal. Roger.

	Section CANARY ISLANDS

01 49 26 CC Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
01 49 28 C Go ahead Canary, Gemini 4.
01 49 30 CC Give me your Read Switch ON - correction, your
Quantity Switch to READ for 10 seconds.
01 49 35 C Quantity Switch is in READ.
01 49 37 CC Roger. We have your secondary Pump B on. Have you
turned it on?
01 49 44 C Roger. We have. Ed's trying to get the stuff out
... It's coming off.

	Page 19
01 50 03 CC Inflate the - - have the Pilot inflate his blood
pressure cuff.
01 50 10 C Can you stand by one, please.
01 50 13 CC Roger.
01 50 29 CC Cryo gage switch OFF.
01 50 33 C It's OFF.
01 50 41 CC Flight advises if you're too busy we'll disregard the
blood pressure.
01 50 45 C I wish you would.
01 51 50 CC Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. Request you turn your computer
OFF, leave the platform powered up.
01 51 56 C Roger ... computer's OFF at this time.
01 53 36 CC Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. Is your water seal OPEN?
01 53 42 C Gemini 4. Negative. Our water seal is not OPEN.
01 53 44 CC Roger.
01 54 03 CC Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. Your Water Seal Valve is
to be OPEN when you start your pressurization and
repress.
01 54 15 C You want the Water Seal Valve OPEN when we start the
pressurization. Is that correct?
01 54 20 CC Roger. When you start pressurization and the repress.
01 54 24 C Roger.
01 54 32 C Be advised we got the cable out.
01 54 34 CC Say again.
01 54 36 C We just got the cable out.
01 54 42 P It was a wrestling match, but I won.
01 56 05 P Be advised that White had his left glove off for
stowage purposes. I've had it off for approximately
15 minutes. This is the standard face-plate OPEN
position.

How me?
01 57 53 CC Gemini 4, how do you read Houston?
01 57 56 C I read -- I read Houston loud and clear.

01 59 58 C ... Houston, Gemini 4. How do you read?
02 00 00 CC I read you loud and clear, Jim. For your attitudes
for EVA go ahead with the same attitudes you had
planned. That's BEF and 180° in roll. That should
be the best for photographic purposes.
02 00 14 C Roger.
02 00 16 CC And to get pictures of the spacecraft, your best bet
would be to move out forward.
02 00 22 C Say again.
02 00 24 CC Your best sun angle for getting a picture of the
spacecraft would be to move out forward from the
spacecraft.
02 00 30 C Roger. He'll move out forward and we'll be BEF upside
down.
02 00 34 CC Roger.
02 00 40 C Boy, is it crowded in here, Gus.
02 00 42 CC I'll bet.
02 00 54 CC Hey, Jim.

02 01 31 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston.
02 01 47 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston.
02 01 50 C Go ahead, Houston. This is Gemini 4.
02 01 54 CC Hey, Jim. You don't have to go upside down if you
don't want to. You can go to whatever position is
best for you.
02 02 02 CC We have no constraint on your attitude.
02 02 18 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
02 03 45 P At this time we are passing over quite a series of
thunderstorm cells, off at our ... Can you see it
out there? ... it should be about your 1 o'clock ...
02 04 37 C No, I can't see it, Maybe ...
02 04 46 P Oh, those must be fireflies again! Are you in the
light over there?
02 04 50 C Yes, I'm in the light.
02 04 51 P How does that happen? I'm in night over here.
02 04 55 C We're going sideways.
02 04 57 C Actually, we're going around to blunt-end-forward.
02 05 00 P All right. A very interesting thing - Jim's got full
daylight out his window, and I have full night out
of mine. We're gradually yawing around to blunt-end-forward,
and it looks like the reflection of the sun
on these fireflies causes them to glow very brightly.
That was the type of stars that we saw on our first
dark side.
02 05 29 P It seems very strange for me to look out Jim's side
and see daylight and look out my side and it's just
pitch black.
02 07 59 P We've got an object out in front of us. It's not
flashing like it's the booster. It appears that it's
that type of an object unless it's picking up some
glow from the sun. It appears a very bright, bright
object.

	Page 22
02 08 30 P We still have the booster at ... it was the booster.
I can see the lights flashing on it now. It's just
passing on the horizon. Just as it goes to darkness,
the reflection of the sun on the booster causes a
very bright image. That's the object I had seen
earlier. It seems like we're still in fair close
proximity of the booster, it looks like it's out
in the neighborhood of 2 or 3 miles.

	Section CARNARVON

02 24 22 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
02 24 24 C Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
02 24 26 CC Roger. Will you give me a - - correction, will you
start pumping up your blood pressure. I don't have
any T/M as yet. Are you in real time in that
position?
02 24 34 C Stand by.
02 24 38 C Negative. We're in COMMAND. Let me give you a real-time
hack position.
02 24 42 CC Roger.
02 24 47 C Ed is off the comm. right now. He's trying to get
his umbilical hooked up.
02 24 50 CC Okay. We need a blood pressure immediately from the
Command Pilot.
02 24 57 C Well, stand by one. Listen, you might advise Flight
by way of land lines that we're running late on this
thing. There's a lot to do and we're having trouble
keeping track of all this stuff.
02 25 09 CC Okay.
02 25 12 C I'll get the blood pressure as soon as I can get
around to it.
02 25 33 CC Give me the switch position on your C-band beacon.
02 25 37 C Roger. It's COMMAND.
02 25 40 C Do you want it back on CONTINUOUS?
02 25 42 CC Affirmative. Back on CONTINUOUS.
02 25 45 C Do you want them both on or just the reentry one?
02 25 48 C Just the capsule.

	Page 23
02 25 51 C Okay. The adapter's on. As soon as I get the blood
pressure I'll give you a call.
02 25 56 CC Okay.
02 26 35 CC Full-scale on your blood pressure.
02 26 48 CC Can give the Quantity Read Switch for about
10 seconds?
02 26 50 C Roger. I don't think you got a good blood pressure.
The bulb popped off.
02 26 53 CC Okay.
02 27 10 CC Gemini 4, you are GO for EVA and decompression. Disregard
the blood pressure unless you've got a few
minutes and then try and get it for us. We'd appreciate it.
02 27 17 C We don't have any time at all. We're really pressed
here.
02 27 21 CC Okay.
02 27 29 CC Okay. After your first repressurization when you're
about 12 to 15 minutes, we want you to go to BYPASS
and return to FLOW after you repressurize again.
02 27 37 C All right. You want us to go to BYPASS before we go
to repressurize. Right?
02 27 41 CC That'll be after your first repressurization.
02 27 45 C Say again.
02 27 47 CC Okay. Between your first and second repressurization,
in that wait period, we want you to put your
radiator to BYPASS and then to FLOW after you repressurize
the second time.
02 27 55 C Roger.
02 28 28 CC Okay. We're done with your Quantity Read.
02 28 30 C Roger.
02 28 44 CC Okay. We're not going to say anything to you on the
ground. If you need anything we'll wait.
02 28 46 C Okay. Listen, has Houston been advised yet that we're
running a little late and we might not be ready at
Hawaii.
02 28 55 CC Okay.

	Page 24
02 29 09 CC Okay. Houston advised that if you are unable to
make it, take your evaluation and we'll pick it up
on the next pass.
02 29 16 C Roger. Understand that.
02 29 18 CC All right.
02 29 21 C That's what we want to get clear.
02 29 23 CC Roger.
02 29 37 CC Okay. You don't have to acknowledge this - you're
in a 89.2 by 155 orbit and it's a 4.8 day lifetime.
02 29 41 C Roger.
02 29 52 CC Turn your Right Secondary O<sub>2</sub> OPEN, your Left Secondary
O<sub>2</sub> CLOSED.
02 30 07 CC Houston advises you can use any attitude you want
for the Extravehicular Activity.
02 33 52 P There was no velcro put on the outdoor 16-mm camera.
We sure could have used it.

until next rev. Then go back over Carnarvon.
02 51 50 C Roger. That's what we're doing right now. We just
couldn't quite hack it.
02 51 52 CC Roger. Understand.
02 53 47 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Standing by.
02 53 50 C Roger. We're getting back into sort of a semi-normal
configuration here. Anything you need?
02 53 57 CC We have nothing for you. I will check with Houston.
02 54 00 C Roger.
02 54 23 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii.
02 54 25 C Go Hawaii, Gemini 4.

	Page 26
02 54 26 CC Be advised you'll probably bring up your computer
over Texas and they will give you a 4-4 load.
02 54 33 C Okay. Very good.
02 54 35 CC That's all we have for you.
02 54 37 C Thank you. We'll talk to you in about an hour and
a half.
02 54 41 CC Roger. Hawaii out.
02 57 05 C Jim McDivitt. Right now it's about T+3 hours.
When we came off the booster at SECO, we had rates
of around half a degree a second. I tried to damp
them out and finally came off around SECO + 30 seconds.
It seemed that as we came off we might have
come off with some other rates. What do you think,
Ed?
02 57 36 P Yes, we did. I wasn't watching as we came off, but
it felt like we did come off.
02 57 41 C Yes, at spacecraft separation. It seems to me we
came off with some rates, the direction of which
I couldn't really tell, but ...
02 57 48 P Felt like we went this way to me.
02 57 51 C Yes.
02 57 52 P We didn't get a linear type forward separation.
02 57 56 C Yes.
02 57 58 C As we got turned around, we came right on around,
and found ourselves about 300 or 400 feet from the
booster. I guess that was about right, wouldn't
you say?
02 58 08 P Yes.
02 58 10 C I thrusted toward the booster about 5 ft/sec. My
separation burn was around the neighborhood of 6 or
7 seconds. I thrusted at the booster for about
5 or 6 ft/sec and then watched it as we were separating
from it. I thrusted about another 5 ft/sec.
Looked like we started closing - we started closing
from off to the side and at about 600 to 700 feet, I
guess. If you think any of these numbers are wrong
just call out.
02 59 50 P No.

	Page 27
02 59 53 C And then it looked like all apparent motion had
stopped and we were probably closing. So I turned
the spacecraft around and made an attempt to aline
the platform. In the meantime, the booster started
dropping down below us at a rather obvious rate.
So I gave up trying to aline the platform to line
up and thrust down toward the booster, and I retrofired
slightly to slow down with it. Once again,
it looked like our rates were stopped. But by now
we had drifted out to about 1000 feet or so. We
then tracked the booster across Africa pointing
down at it all the way. We got in to sunset pretty
quick and at sunset I guess we were at about
1200 feet, Ed?
02 59 59 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
03 00 00 P Yes, we were in fairly close.
03 00 02 C We were at 1200 feet and closing slightly.
03 00 09 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
03 00 09 P I'll get them.
03 00 10 C Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
03 00 15 C As we went into nighttime we were ...
03 00 17 C Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
03 00 19 CC Roger. Jim, you're going to be live as you make
your pass across the States this time.

	(Watch Timed)
03 00 24 C Okay. Anything in particular you wanted me to say?
03 00 31 CC Suit yourself.
03 00 33 C Okay.
03 00 39 CC Hey, Jim. Could you give me an idea of how much
you - what was the ratio of your thruster use, how
much you used your aft firing, and how much you used
your forward firing thrusters back early in the
Flight Plan?
03 00 50 C Yes. I'll give you percentage. I used the top
thrusters down for about 10 or 15 seconds, I guess.
I used the aft firing ones almost the entire time
aside from that.
03 01 13 CC Roger. I copy. Ten or 15 seconds on the down, almost
all the rest of it on the aft.

	Page 28
03 01 18 C Eight or 10 seconds on the forward firing ones, but
that's about all.
03 01 21 CC Roger.

	(End of Watch Timing)
03 01 29 C I might add that we have seen the booster. It continues
to circle around with us, but it's just too
far off to go get.
03 01 33 CC Roger. Hey, would you check your ACQ aid circuit
breaker and make sure it's ON.
03 01 37 C Make sure that it's OFF?
03 01 38 CC It's ON.
03 01 41 C Okay. It's OFF at this time. It's coming back ON.
03 01 44 CC Okay. It's coming ON.
03 01 47 C Negative. It's coming ON.
03 01 49 CC Roger. ON.
03 01 51 C Righto.
03 02 09 CC Hey, Jim, you do have your computer ON, don't you?
03 02 13 C Negative. I don't have it ON. Do you want it ON
at this time?
03 02 15 CC Roger. Turn it ON. We're going to give you a 4-4
time.
03 02 18 C Okay. I thought we were going to get it later.
I'll turn it ON at this time.
03 02 23 CC At PRELAUNCH Mode.
03 02 26 C Roger. PRELAUNCH.
03 02 43 CC Computer light is on. We're ready.
03 02 46 CC Say again, Jim.
03 02 47 C I say, my computer light is on. We're ready.
03 02 49 CC Roger.
03 03 04 CC I think you did a smart thing back there.
03 03 08 C Yes, Gus. It would have been a short flight if we'd
kept chasing that mother around.
03 03 12 CC Yes. Sounds like you've been awfully busy the first
couple of orbits, you know.

	Page 29
03 03 17 C It would have been impossible. We would never have
done the EVA at all.
03 03 29 C We're finally getting a chance to look out here, Gus,
and it's really nice.
03 04 16 CC Hey, Jim. Jim, this is Houston. Hey, Gemini 4,
Houston CAP COM.
03 04 24 C Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
03 04 26 CC How about describing the way the cockpit is laid out
now, with all of your gear out?
03 04 35 C Okay. Well, we've got to the get-out position here,
and when we finally called it quits it was obvious
that we weren't going to make it at that time without
really rushing. I didn't want to do that.
03 04 44 CC Roger.
03 04 46 C Ed has most of the equipment on him right now. I've
got the gun and the camera and the hatch fitting, the
fitting to tie the two suit hoses together. Ed has
all the other paraphernalia on him right now, but he's
on the suit circuit. He's got the Repress valve OFF
and we're just about all set to go. I think when we
get about over Africa we're going to go through the
checklist again, and when we get to Carnarvon we'll
be all set.
03 05 22 CC Roger. Have you taken any pictures yet?
03 05 25 C No. As a matter of fact, we really haven't had time
to do much.
03 05 28 CC You haven't had any time yet, have you?
03 05 30 C It's a nice spacecraft though, Gus.
03 05 35 CC Good. Do you have the Shut-off valve on the chestpack
CLOSED?
03 05 40 C Roger. It is.
03 05 41 CC Okay.
03 05 44 C Okay, did we get an update then?
03 05 57 CC Roger. It got in okay.
03 06 21 CC Gemini 4. Gemini 4, Houston.
03 06 35 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
03 06 45 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
03 07 10 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

	Page 30
03 07 13 C Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4. Do you read now?
03 07 19 CC Roger, I lost you there for a minute. Say, you
never did start to decompress, did you?
03 07 22 C Say again.
03 07 24 CC Did you ever start decompressing?
03 07 26 C Negative. We never started decompressing.
03 07 28 CC Roger, understand.
03 07 48 C Houston CAP COM, this is Gemini 4. Looks like we're
over Texas now, huh?
03 07 53 CC You say you're coming right over Big T?
03 07 56 C Roger ...
03 07 58 CC See any of it?
03 07 59 C Sure can. We're coming over the Gulf right now.
03 08 05 CC Right over Gulf, huh? Has your weather been good
around the orbit?
03 08 10 C Frankly, we haven't really had time to look out too
much ...
03 08 17 CC Roger. Can you still see the booster?
03 08 19 C I don't even know where it is right now, Gus.
03 08 21 CC Roger.
03 08 23 C We saw it just as we went into darkness. We stayed
with it all through the darkness ...
03 08 31 CC You're getting awfully garbled.
03 08 33 C Roger. I say again. We saw it when we were in the
darkness, but we haven't seen it since we came back
out into the light.
03 08 39 CC Roger, understand. You saw it on the dark side.
03 09 08 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
03 09 10 C Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
03 09 11 CC Roger. We just switched remote. Is Ed still there?
03 09 16 C Yes, he doesn't like to talk, I guess.
03 09 21 P I'm sitting here enjoying the view.
03 09 24 CC Roger. Do you get pretty heated up getting all that
gear on?
03 09 27 P I got ... we got pretty warm.

	Page 31
03 09 30 CC How do you feel now?
03 09 31 P Fine.
03 09 32 CC Good.
03 09 51 CC You guys had any water to drink yet?
03 09 53 C Negative.
03 10 04 CC Hey, Jim, we figure the booster ought to be about
32 miles ahead of you and 5 miles below you at this
time.
03 10 10 C Thirty-two ahead and 5 below.
03 10 12 CC Roger.
03 10 29 P We've got quite a good view of the whole state of
Florida, and we're passing over it now.
03 10 34 CC You've got Florida in sight, huh?
03 10 35 P We can see it from the top to the bottom.
03 10 39 CC Very good.
03 10 43 P In fact, we're looking right down at the Cape now.
You can see the launch complexes down there. It's
quite clear.
03 11 06 CC Hey, Jim. Gemini 4.
03 11 11 C Go ahead.
03 11 14 CC We'd like for you to turn your cabin heat exchanger
ON until you get ready to decompress. And the fan.
03 11 20 C Roger. We're not getting hot if that's what you're
worried about.
03 11 26 CC Cabin temperature is getting up a little.
03 11 28 C Okay.
03 11 44 C Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4.
03 12 46 CC Go ahead.
03 12 51 CC This is Houston. Go ahead.
03 12 52 C Roger. How about turning the computer OFF again?
03 12 57 CC Affirmative, turn it OFF. Don't forget to drink
some water now.
03 13 06 C Yes. Can we turn the computer OFF?
03 13 08 CC Roger. Turn the computer OFF.
03 13 28 C Houston. Gemini 4, do you read?

	Page 32
03 13 30 CC Roger, we read you. Go ahead.
03 13 32 C Roger. How about turning the computer OFF?
03 13 34 CC Roger, turn OFF the computer.
03 13 37 C Okay.
03 15 54 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
03 15 55 C Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
03 15 56 CC Hey, your cabin temperature came down 10° since
you turned your heat exchanger ON.
03 16 02 C Roger.
03 16 29 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
03 16 33 C Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
03 16 34 CC As you come over Ascension I want to try to give you
a check there. The air-ground remote hasn't worked
too well today but we sure would like to get that
one up.
03 16 41 C Roger, we'll be waiting.
03 16 44 CC Roger.
03 16 45 C Would you advise, we've both had a drink, and I had
10 swallows.
03 16 51 CC Roger.
03 27 42 P We've got another sighting on the booster. It looks
like it's just about horizontal with us and right
straight out in front of us.
03 27 48 C Small-end-forward.
03 27 49 P We are going small-end-forward and it looks like it's
very close to our orbit.
03 27 58 C And it's at about 3:28 elapsed time.
03 29 48 P The lights on the booster are still blinking. I can
see them at this time.
03 34 00 C We're just at 3+24 right now. Just going into darkness.
The sunlight has been shining on the nose of
the spacecraft with small-end-forward, just about.
Actually, we're 30° left of being straight ahead,
small-end-forward. And the way the sun was shining
on the edge of the booster ... spacecraft was
causing a reflection, just like someone had a mirror
there and was shining it straight ahead.

	Page 33
03 34 34 P Yes, that's what ... that last time, Jim.
03 34 41 C A bunch of thunderstorms out on the horizon.
03 34 51 C Okay. We get to Carnarvon at 3:58. That's when
we're going to get our GO. We start our depressurization
right there. What we're going to do is
that we're going to open the Repress, tighten your
helmet, ...
03 35 17 P We've got one thing left to do in the steps. We've
got to take these off, Jim.
03 35 20 C Take what off?
03 35 21 P The suit pressure lines and put them on the interconnect.
03 35 25 C Yes, that's not yet though ...
03 35 28 P Do you have the interconnect over there handy?
03 35 29 C Yes, I've got it right here.
03 35 30 P Okay.
03 35 31 C This is in the egress.
03 35 31 P All right.
03 35 32 C When we start at Carnarvon.
03 35 34 C Open the Repress Valve. Okay, this is what we're
going to do. Helmet tied on?
03 35 38 P Yes.
03 35 40 C Right Suit Flow Control OFF?
03 35 45 P Right.
03 35 46 C Disconnect inlet and outlet ECS hoses. Remove your
interconnect.
03 36 14 C Okay, let's see. Remove the interconnect. Interconnect
the two ECS hoses ... by your elbow.
03 36 24 P Okay.
03 36 24 C Pack Primary O<sub>2</sub> OPEN.
03 36 28 P Roger.
03 36 29 C Not yet.
03 36 30 P No.
03 36 33 C EVA Emergency Shut off OPEN.
03 36 36 P Roger. Check the FLOW.

	Page 34
03 36 37 C Check the emergency FLOW and then back to CLOSED.
03 36 38 P Roger.
03 36 40 C Recheck your suit, your pack, and tether.
03 36 42 P Roger.
03 36 43 C Recheck your face-plate closed and locked. Helmet
locked, gloves on, inlet-outlet "Y", and ECS hoses
free. And then I'll have a Command Pilot Suit Check,
which I've already done ... on to check the flow.
Hatch lock OPEN. Then you've got your other things
to check. When we actually start the Depressurization
Mode, Cabin Vent valve go to 2 psi, then we
close the vent valve. Then we install both blood
pressure pump plugs, which I don't seem to be able
to find.
03 38 05 C Gee, I don't even have one on my suit.
03 38 07 P I don't have one either, Jim.
03 38 15 C Swell.
03 38 18 P Aw, baloney.
03 38 23 P I sure don't see one.
03 38 30 C Nope, I don't have one.
03 38 31 P I don't either, unless it's up under my cover.
03 38 42 C No, you don't have one, Ed.
03 38 45 P The hole's not big enough but still you ought to
have one.
03 38 50 C Right.
03 39 00 P Neither of our suits have the blood pressure cuff -
blood pressure plug
03 39 07 P And we just had a very pretty moonset.
03 39 10 C Just a casual comment here. We looked out and
thought we saw the horizon. It turned out, it was
obviously air glow. We could see the stars well below
its edge.
03 49 10 C We'll talk about this some more later when we get
more time.

	Page 35
03 50 07 P We noticed the old familiar pulsing in the suits
when we had the RECIRC closed all the way down and
our dampers that time were open full in both suits.
It was the same type of a pulsation that occurred
in altitude chamber and which was, I believe, duplicated
in the testing.
03 50 33 P Cabin pressure seems to hold around 4.8 to 5.0,
right on the bottom. Also, our Left Secondary Oxygen
is pretty high, looks like it's up around 5400.
Been that way ever since we started.

	Section CARNARVON

03 57 34 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
03 57 36 C Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4. How do you read?
03 57 38 CC Loud and clear. Will you turn you cabin fan OFF,
heat exchanger full warm?
03 57 45 C Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
03 57 46 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
03 57 50 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Over.
03 57 59 C Hello, Carnarvon. Hello, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
03 58 01 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
03 58 04 C Roger, Carnarvon. Gemini 4. How do you read?
03 58 07 CC Loud and clear. How me? Over.
03 58 08 C Loud and clear.
03 58 10 CC Roger. Will you turn your cabin fan OFF. Heat
exchanger full warm?
03 58 15 C Roger.
03 58 18 CC Roger. We'd like a blood pressure from the Command
Pilot.
03 58 30 P The cabin fan does give a noticeable squeal when
it's on. I notice now that the fan is off. I
notice a definite decrease.
03 58 35 CC What's your status on EVA?
03 58 37 C The status is GO for EVA.

	Page 36
03 58 39 CC Okay. You're GO for EVA from here. Stand by for
decompression - correction, depressurization. Can
you give us a blood pressure? On the Command Pilot?
03 58 43 C The status is GO for EVA.
03 58 45 P The cabin appears to be venting at about 5.3. Just
heard the vent valve going ... for EVA.
03 58 49 C Roger. I'm going to try to give you a blood pressure
right now.
03 58 51 CC All right.
03 59 15 CC Okay. Keep coming, it's coming up.
03 59 24 CC You are up to full-scale.
03 59 37 CC Can you give me about 10 seconds on your Quantity
Read switch, please?
03 59 57 P Quantity Read is ON.
03 59 58 CC Roger.
04 00 08 P Quantity Read is OFF.
04 00 10 CC Roger.
04 00 16 CC Okay. We got a good blood pressure from you.
04 00 19 CC Your Right Secondary O<sub>2</sub> should be OPEN and your
Left Secondary O<sub>2</sub> should be CLOSED.
04 00 26 P That is affirmative. That's the configuration. The
left is CLOSED; the right is OPEN.
04 00 31 C We have a GO to start decompression, is that right?.
04 00 34 CC That's affirmative for decompression and a GO for
EVA.
04 00 37 C Roger ... call again near Hawaii.
04 00 41 CC Roger. Very good.
04 01 02 CC We'd like for you to turn your Quantity Switch to
READ from now on until the end of the EVA.
04 01 07 CC Okay. I got it on.
04 01 10 CC I'll be standing by here on the ground and keep the
conversation down.
04 01 13 C Roger.
04 07 21 P Okay.
04 07 24 C Hatch lock OPEN.

	Page 37
04 07 29 P Hatch locks are OPEN.
04 07 30 C Okay.
04 07 33 C Don your other thermal gloves. I guess you got one
of them.
04 07 38 P The thermal gloves didn't work out too bad, Jim.
04 07 42 C Yes. Okay. We're going to vent the cabin now.
04 07 43 P Yes.
04 07 45 C Two psi. Did you get that, ... Ed? We're going
to close vent valve and we're going to check those
blood pressure readings that we have. We're going
to check the suits for leaks at 2 psi. Check yours
to make sure that suit ... one. Okay?
04 08 00 P Ready to go.
04 08 09 C Hear the valve?
04 08 10 P Roger.
04 08 12 C Carnarvon, do you still read Gemini 4?
04 08 22 C Are we ...
04 10 45 P Okay.
04 10 48 P I hear it - I'll keep mine...where do you...oh, you
want mine? All right, I'm sorry, Jim.
04 10 50 P All right.
04 10 53 C Okay.
04 10 55 P Roger, we're in a vacuum now and the right suit is
holding at 4 and the flow is satisfactory. I'm not
overly warm.
04 11 02 C Okay. We've got the cabin vent valve open ...
cabin at zero. Time to unlock the hatch.
04 11 10 P Roger. Time to unlock the hatch.
04 11 12 C ...
04 11 17 P Well, the thing about it, I've got to do something
with the cabin ...
04 11 21 P Okay.
04 11 24 C What are we going to do with ... ?
04 11 26 P Hold on to it, cause I can't ... it.
04 11 29 C ...

	Page 38
04 11 50 C What's the matter? Isn't it working?
04 11 53 P Uh huh.
04 11 55 P ... work up here.
04 12 02 C ... unlocked ...
04 12 05 P Yes, I know they're unlocked.
04 12 07 P I'11 look again.
04 12 09 P That's why I had these gloves made this way so I
could take them off.
04 12 12 C Right.
04 12 17 C ... you're staying up with it, buddy.
04 12 19 P What?
04 12 24 P That's up.
04 12 26 C Say again.
04 12 28 P They're both on UP.
04 12 31 C Okay.
04 12 45 C Now you have ...
04 12 55 P I know it.
04 13 07 P Three cycles.
04 13 08 C Okay, let me stand by for a minute here and get the
... controls.
04 13 29 P ... to LOCK so we can get on it. Okay now, that's
working.
04 13 53 C Take it easy, Ed ...
04 14 09 C Woke up?
04 14 11 P Yes, just wait a minute.
04 14 14 C Yes, but listen, don't you ... Stand by one, Ed.
04 14 18 P Are they doing anything?
04 14 18 C ...
04 14 19 P Are they moving?
04 14 22 C No, they're not moving a bit.
04 14 24 C Think we're ...
04 14 32 P Hold these a minute, will you?

	Page 39
04 14 36 C Just take it easy. If we don't make it this time,
we'll make it next time.
04 14 38 P Roger. Next time around.
04 14 41 C Or tomorrow.
04 14 43 C You can't see too well with that visor on either,
can you?
04 14 56 P They're both on UNLOCK.
04 15 10 C ...
04 15 17 P Are they moving, Jim?
04 15 19 C Stand by. I can't see ...
04 15 27 C Negative, it looks like they're not moving at all.
04 15 43 P Looks like that thing, isn't moving.
04 15 45 P I'll take it easy a minute.
04 15 48 C Yes, no sweat.
04 16 08 C You know, it's a good thing we can't get it open
and not close.
04 16 10 P Yes.
04 16 15 C Let's not leave it OFF.
04 16 17 P I'm on LOCK now.
04 16 24 C Where're you going?
04 16 33 P This is the first time it's ever failed this way.
04 16 36 C Sure is.
04 16 39 C No it isn't either. It failed that way up at
McDonnell.
04 16 42 P So that it wouldn't move at all?
04 16 43 C Yes.
04 16 45 P So it was just free swiveling.
04 16 48 C Yes, it - I know what the trouble is. It's a spring
pushing it back.
04 17 00 C I think it will be all right.
04 17 02 C Let me go to MANUAL and ...
04 17 30 P I got it, Jim.
04 17 31 C Wait a second.
04 17 33 P Okay.

	Page 40
04 17 36 P You got it?
04 17 37 C Yes, I got it.
04 17 39 P All right.
04 17 40 C Okay, now make sure you get that mother back on.
04 17 43 P Back in LOCK.
04 17 44 C All the way?
04 17 45 P Yes.
04 17 48 C Okay. You got it LOCKED, UNLOCKED all the way then?
04 17 50 P Yes, I do, Jim.
04 17 53 P They're all back in LOCK now?
04 17 56 P Okay. I'm going to take it easy now.
04 18 00 C Yes, do that. Now, I want to get the spacecraft
right-side up and leave that last ...
04 18 04 P What a view! By golly. You can see the black sky
up above.
04 18 10 C Okay, just a second. Let me get the spacecraft
where I want it.
04 18 12 P All right.
04 18 17 P Door's a little harder to move than I thought.
04 18 21 P Yes.
04 18 28 P It sure is clear and crystal smooth.
04 18 33 P Are we on VOX, Jim?
04 18 36 C Something just fell out.
04 18 38 P It was a bolt.
04 18 41 C No, it was a big white thing.
04 18 43 P It's my ... it's adrift probably, huh?
04 18 44 C What?
04 18 45 P It's my lanyard.
04 18 48 C No, I thought I saw it floating away ...
04 18 51 C Oh, yes. You can...
04 19 00 P Okay, my visor's down.
04 19 12 C Okay, take it easy.
04 19 14 P Right.

	Page 41
04 19 19 C ...
04 19 33 P I'm going out there to install the cameras, Jim.
04 19 36 C Okay.
04 19 41 P The sun's very bright back this way.
04 19 43 C Is it?
04 19 45 P Yes.
04 19 46 C ... your visor.
04 19 48 P Got my visor down.
04 19 50 C Your foot.
04 19 52 P Huh?
04 19 55 C You're going to have to watch your foot.
04 19 57 P Okay.
04 20 00 P You see, I have to turn all around to do this, Jim.
04 20 02 C Yes, I know.
04 20 04 C Just move it all over the equipment there.
04 20 05 P All right.
04 20 17 P I can see your thrusters firing.
04 20 24 P We're taking some pictures now.
04 20 36 P Am I clobbering the switches, Jim?
04 20 38 C Yes, you're really all over 'em, Ed.
04 20 41 P Okay. Hand me the umbilical guard.
04 20 45 C Take it easy now. You sound like you're pulsing.
04 20 49 P No, I'm in good shape.
04 20 50 C Listen, hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
04 20 55 P You got it through?
04 20 56 C No, hold on.
04 21 00 P Roger. Got plenty of time. Boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
04 21 02 C Pretty neat, huh?
04 21 03 P Yes, it's something!
04 21 05 C Think we're T/M ... Here, I got one of your gloves
... I got both of your gloves.
04 21 09 P Yes, I don't even need them right now.

	Page 42
04 21 17 C Okay ... the T/M. They're calling back now.
04 21 29 P As Ole Leonov says, * work out in
space. It isn't very much, but I'm doing something.
04 21 33 C Pretty black out there, isn't it?
04 21 36 P Yes.
04 21 38 P Okay, I turned the camera off, so I would save it.
04 21 47 P Oh, I just knocked it off the mount.
04 21 48 C Did you?
04 21 50 P Yes, I'll go back and get it.
04 21 55 C Tell me. How do you like this glass?
04 21 57 P That's fine.
04 22 02 P You know, I'm kinda glad I got the visor on ...
for the work I'm doing.
04 22 07 C Pretty bright?
04 22 09 P Well, I'm looking right into it.
04 22 17 C Your jiggling around actually moves the spacecraft.
04 22 19 P Does it? I can see it pulsing.
04 22 29 P Okay. I'm going to feed the umbilical out.
04 22 31 C Okay. Be careful you don't trip some of the switches.
Let me give it to you.
04 22 37 P Okay. Feed her out slow.
04 22 43 C Okay. I've got ...
04 22 48 P All right.
04 22 55 C ...

	Section HAWAII

04 23 03 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
04 23 14 C Hawaii, do you read Gemini 4?
04 23 17 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii.
04 23 19 C Hello, Hawaii. Hello, Hawaii. Gemini 4. How do
you read?
04 23 22 CC Roger. Read you loud and clear. Can you give us
a status on your decompression?

	Page 43
04 23 24 C We're going to put you on RECORD so the whole world
can hear this later on.
04 23 26 P All right.
04 23 28 C Hawaii, Gemini 4. Do you read?
04 23 30 C You're on RECORD. We're on CONTINUOUS INTERPHONE-PUSH
TO TALK. Still on UHF.
04 23 30 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Read you loud and clear.
How me?
04 23 32 C Very good, Ed. Very good.
04 23 38 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you read?
04 23 39 C Stand by one.
04 24 40 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Read you loud and clear.
What is your status on decompression?
04 24 46 C Hello, Hawaii, Hello, Hawaii. Gemini 4. Do you
read?
04 24 51 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Read you loud and clear.
How me?
04 24 54 C Loud and clear. We're on VOX. I guess you aren't
getting us on VOX.
04 24 57 CC Roger. We just now received you. What is your
status on decompression?
04 25 02 C Got the outside 60-mm camera mounted, and he's
getting the gun ready right now.
04 25 09 CC Roger. I understand. Can you give us a reading on
emergency O<sub>2</sub>?
04 25 16 CC Did you copy, Gemini 4?
04 25 18 C Roger. You mean the emergency O<sub>2</sub> in Ed's bottle?
04 25 21 CC Affirmative.
04 25 22 C This one's full and ...
	(3400 psi)
04 25 25 P It's 34 right now. 
04 25 26 C It's 34 right now.
04 25 30 C Say something.
04 25 31 P It's 34 right now. Hasn't changed a step. How do
you read?
04 25 36 CC Roger. Read you loud and clear Pilot. How me?

	Page 44
04 25 36 P Outside the spacecraft, as a matter of fact.
04 25 42 CC Roger. Understand.
04 26 07 C Roger. He has the hatch open. He's standing in
the seat.
04 26 11 CC Roger. Understand. Houston will give you a GO or
NO GO to exit spacecraft over Guaymas. Did you
copy?
04 26 26 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
04 26 28 C Go ahead, Hawaii, Gemini 4.
04 26 30 CC Roger. Did you copy my last? Houston will give
you GO-NO GO to exit spacecraft over Guaymas.
04 26 36 C Roger. Everything looks good here. What do you
think?
04 26 40 CC We're happy with it.
04 26 42 CC Everything looks good on the ground, Gemini 4.
04 26 46 C Very good.
04 27 19 C Our ECS is still good. It's reading still 50 percent.
Looks like we're not even using any.
04 27 26 CC We concur on the ground.
04 27 31 C When he's moving around out there, he's really rocking
the spacecraft around.
04 27 35 CC Roger. Understand.
04 28 11 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
04 28 13 C Go ahead, Hawaii. Gemini 4.
04 28 14 CC Roger. We just had word from Houston. We're ready
to have you get out whenever you're ready. Give us
a mark when you egress the spacecraft.
04 28 25 C Okay. We've got our GO now. Is that right?
04 28 26 CC Affirmative.
04 28 27 C Okay.
04 28 39 CC Be sure and give us a mark when he egresses.
04 28 43 C Okay. We're still doing a little work right here.
04 28 45 CC Roger. Understand.
04 29 14 P All right.

	Page 45
04 29 21 C You're in RECORD and CONTINUOUS INTERPHONE-PUSH TO
TALK. I'm on UHF. How are you doing?
04 29 24 P I'm in good shape.
04 29 25 C Okay ...
04 29 28 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. What is your status now?
04 29 30 C Roger. We're about ready to start getting out.
Ed just got one of his gloves back on. He'll put
another one on and then he'll be ready to go.
04 29 33 P I'm not going to carry it, Jim. I don't need it.
04 29 38 C You're not going to carry it?
04 29 40 C Okay. We're all set, Ed, right now. Ready to go
out slowly.
04 29 41 CC Can you repeat, Gemini 4?
04 29 43 P Yes.
04 29 44 C Listen, do you want me to get the spacecraft in any
other attitude or does this look okay?
04 29 48 P Looks okay, Jim.
04 29 50 C Okay. I'll tell you when.
04 29 50 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Can you repeat your last
transmission?
04 29 52 P I'm ready.
04 29 53 C Okay, stand by one. I want to get my timer set.
I'll give you a GO in just about 2 minutes - or less.
04 29 59 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
04 30 00 P I'm going to have to let the camera run out because
it's too hard to work.
04 30 02 C Okay, just a second.
04 30 06 P Ready.
04 30 07 C Okay, go ahead.
04 30 11 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
04 30 19 P Okay. I'm separating from the spacecraft.
04 30 21 C Okay. He's separated from the spacecraft at this
time, Hawaii.
04 30 25 C ...
04 30 26 P Okay. My feet are out.

	Page 46
04 30 27 C Okay. His feet are out.
04 30 29 P I think I'm dragging a little bit, so I don't want
to fire the gun yet.
04 30 33 C ...
04 30 36 P Okay. I'm out.
04 30 38 C Okay. He's out. He's floating free.
04 30 48 P Okay. I put a little roll in, took it right out.
04 30 50 C Very good.
04 31 00 P Am I in your view, Jimbo?
04 31 02 C Well, you know I can't see ...
04 31 04 P Don't sweat it. I'll come to you.
04 31 12 C Oops! There goes your glove. Well, we'll just let
it go.
04 31 14 P All right.
04 31 19 P Okay. I rolled off and I'm rolling to the right now.
Under my own influence. There goes a - looks like
a thermal glove, Jim.
04 31 26 C It is, Ed.
04 31 28 P All right. Now, I've come above the spacecraft and
I'm under my own control.
04 31 45 P It really looks funny to see my glove out there, Jim.
04 31 48 C Does it?
04 31 50 P Yes. Okay, I'd better get over. Okay, I'm coming
over.
04 32 00 C Okay. Stand by.
04 32 02 P See me yet?
04 32 04 C No, sure don't.
04 32 05 P Huh?
04 32 07 P Oh, there you are. I can spin around now.
04 32 12 C Okay. Just a second. You're right in front, Ed.
You look beautiful.
04 32 16 P I feel like a million dollars. All right we'll pitch
up and yaw left. I'm coming back to you.
04 32 16 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 32 24 C Stand by. I get the swizzle stick out of here.

	Page 47
04 32 25 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 32 31 P Okay. I put in a little bit too much pitch there.
04 32 36 P The gun works real great, Jim.
04 32 38 C Let me get over where I can see you, Ed.
04 32 40 P Take it easy now. You're in a vacuum.
04 32 40 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 32 42 C Ha! Ha? No, I want to get the spacecraft on the
horizon.
04 32 47 P All right.
04 32 50 P Okay. I'll come in and take a look at you now.
04 32 52 C Wait a second. Let me take your picture.
04 32 52 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 32 55 P Just a minute - just a minute.
04 33 04 P This gun is very good.
04 33 07 C Is it?
04 33 08 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 33 09 P Yes. I've got me upside down. Now I see my glove
is departing.
04 33 14 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 33 16 P Okay. Don't fire the thrusters.
04 33 16 C Okay. Don't. I'm going on. Who's calling
Gemini 4?
04 33 20 CC Houston CAP COM. Has he egressed?
04 33 24 C He's out, Gus and it's really nifty. Listen, our
VOX doesn't work very well, and I don't seem to
read anybody. You will have to relay. The gun
works swell. He's been able to maneuver all over -
out front, back under the nose, and he's back out
again.
04 33 34 CC Say again.
04 33 35 C ... work very well, but I don't think he can read
anybody. So I'll have to relay. The gun works
swell. He's been able to maneuver all over - out
front, back under the nose, and he's back out again.
04 33 45 CC That's great!
04 33 45 C Ed?

	Page 48
04 33 46 P Yes.
04 33 48 C Let me try VOX again. Say something.
04 33 52 P Hello, Gus. How do you read, CAP COM?
04 33 56 C Hey, Gus, do you read?
04 33 58 CC I read you now, Ed.
04 34 00 C It's not really working, Ed.
04 34 02 P All right.
04 34 04 C Okay. Listen, I still can't see you out there.
04 34 05 CC It's working. Keep talking.
04 34 07 P All right. I've drifted off to the side. I think
we're going to have ... I'm taking pictures now,
Jim.
04 34 11 CC Gemini 4, it's working. Keep talking.
04 34 11 C Okay.
04 34 15 C Make that flag look pretty.
04 34 19 P Yes.
04 34 21 P Okay. I'm right by the stub antenna now.
04 34 24 CC Gemini 4, keep talking. It's working.
04 34 24 C Okay. Let me get some ... to you, Ed. I ought
to be getting some tremendous pictures of you. Let
me try again with the Hasselblad.
04 34 30 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 34 31 P Okay. I think I've exhausted my air now.
04 34 33 C Okay.
04 34 36 C Stay right there.
04 34 40 P I had very good control with it. I just needed
more air.
04 34 45 C Okay. Stand by. Let me take a couple of pictures,
ole buddy.
04 34 48 P All right.
04 34 52 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 34 54 C Go ahead, Gus.
04 34 58 CC Tell him to keep talking. We're receiving Ed
through your VOX.

	Page 49
04 35 00 P Ara you reading me, CAP COM?
04 35 01 P ... Gus?
04 35 02 C Okay. We're going to VOX now.
04 35 04 C Okay, Ed. They're receiving you.
04 35 07 P Okay.
04 35 09 C Tell them what you think.
04 35 10 P That's right, CAP COM, it's very easy to maneuver
with the gun. The only problem I have is that I
haven't got enough fuel. I've exhausted the fuel
now and I was able to maneuver myself around the
front of the spacecraft, back, and maneuver right
up to the top of the adapter. Just about ...
came back into Jim's view. The only thing I wish
is that I had more. This is the greatest experience
I've ... it's just tremendous! Right now
I'm standing on my head, and I'm looking right down,
and it looks like we're coming up on the coast of
California. I'm going into a slow rotation to the
right. There is absolutely no disorientation associated
with it.
04 35 52 C One thing about it, when Ed gets out there and
starts wiggling around, it sure makes the spacecraft
tough to control.
04 36 02 P I feel just about like a ... commercial.
04 36 03 CC Is he taking pictures?
04 36 11 CC Take some pictures.
04 36 12 P Okay. I'm going to work on getting some pictures,
Jim.
04 36 14 C Okay. Get out in front where I can see you again.
04 36 16 P Yes.
04 36 18 C I've only got about three on the Hasselblad.
04 36 20 P Okay.
04 36 22 C Where are you?
04 36 24 P Right out in front now. I don't have the control
I had any more without that gun.
04 36 28 C Yes, I noticed that.
04 36 31 P On the tether.
04 36 31 CC You've got about 5 minutes.

	Page 50
04 36 33 P But I want to get out and shoot some good pictures.
I'm not satisfied with that. Okay, I'm drifting
down underneath the spacecraft.
04 36 40 C Okay. I'm going to start firing the thrusters now.
04 36 45 P All right. There's no difficulty in recontacting
the spacecraft. It's all very soft, particularly
as long as you move nice and slow. I'm very thankful
to have the experience. It's great, Gus. Right
now I'm right on top of the spacecraft - just above
Jim's window. I'll bring myself in and put myself
out into your view, Jim.
04 37 09 C Okay. Hold it and I'll take your picture.
04 37 24 P Right now I could maneuver much better if I didn't
have the gun with the camera on it, because I have
to tie one hand up with it.
04 37 31 C Okay. Stay right there if you can.
04 37 47 C Okay, do you want me to maneuver for you now, Ed?
04 37 50 P No, I think you're doing fine. What I'd like to do
is get all the way out, Jim, and get a picture of
the whole spacecraft. I don't seem to be doing
that.
04 38 00 C Yes, I noticed that. You can't seem to get far
enough away.
04 38 02 P No.
04 38 05 C Where are you now? Am I clear to thrust a little
bit?
04 38 07 P No, don't thrust now.
04 38 12 C Okay. Ed, just free-float around. Right now we're
pointing just about straight down at the ground.
04 38 14 P Okay, now I'm taking a look back at the adapter and
equipment back there. I can see the separation
plane; it's quite clean. The thrusters are clean.
The thermal paint, the thermal stripping looks quite
good. Also, the velcro that we put on seems to be
in good shape right by the camera. I'm coming back
down on the spacecraft. I can sit up here and see
the whole California coast.
04 38 58 P Okay. Now I'm going to go out and see how much ...
if I've got enough harness.
04 39 26 P The sky sure is black.

	Page 51
04 39 34 C Hey, Ed, can you see into the right-hand hatch,
right now?
04 39 37 P No.
04 39 38 C Aw, shoot!
04 39 41 P Let me work on back. Listen, it's all the difference
in the world with this gun. When that gun was
working, I was maneuvering all around.
04 39 50 C ...
04 39 52 P Yes. Okay.
04 40 20 P ... contacted.
04 40 22 C Yes.
04 40 24 P How are you doing old buddy?
04 40 26 C Pretty good. How about you?
04 40 28 P Good. Looking right in your window.
04 40 31 C Where? You're not even there. Are you there, Ed?
04 40 32 P No, I'm moving out now.
04 40 34 C Let me take a picture.
04 40 53 P Okay, there I go. No. Boy, I sure could use that
gun.
04 40 53 C A pretty neat little contraption, huh?
04 40 55 P Yes. All the strings that are attached to me tend
to dampen out my travel on the lanyard.
04 41 04 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 41 09 C Yes, I noticed that.
04 41 10 CC You've got 4 minutes and 30 seconds left.
04 41 10 P Okay, I'm going to free drift a little bit, and see
if I can drift into some good picture-taking position.
04 41 16 C Okay. Here, let me control the spacecraft ...
04 41 33 C Just for your information Ed, we're only down to
48 percent on our O<sub>2</sub>.
04 41 38 P Okay.
04 41 40 C ECS O<sub>2</sub> pressure is about 830, so it's staying right
up there.

	Page 52
04 41 45 P You know one thing about this. Where we have this
tether attached, I can't get a good push off.
04 41 52 C Oh yes, is that right? Where it's attached to you
or where it's attached to the spacecraft?
04 42 00 P Where it's attached to the spacecraft. There's
nothing particularly to get a push off on. Now,
let's see if I can get a decent push off. If I
didn't have the gun I could do a little better.
There just isn't anything to push on.
04 42 01 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 42 07 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 42 19 C Ed, smile.
04 42 26 P I'm looking right down your gun barrel. All right.
04 42 28 C Let me take a closeup picture of you.
04 42 30 P Okay. Just a minute.
04 42 31 C You smeared up my windshield, you dirty dog!
04 42 34 P Did I really?
04 42 35 C Yes.
04 42 37 P Well, hand me out a kleenex and I'll clean it.
04 42 40 C Ha! See how it's all smeared up there?
04 42 44 P Yes.
04 42 45 C It looks like there is a coating on the outside and
you've rubbed it off.
04 42 47 P Yes.
04 42 50 C That's exactly what you've done.
04 42 53 P Okay.
04 42 53 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 42 54 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 42 55 C Okay. Right now, the spacecraft rates are up about
1 deg/sec in pitch and yaw, and about 1/2 deg/sec
in roll.
04 43 05 P I'm not satisfied with the pictures that I've
gotten yet.
04 43 10 C Okay.
04 43 14 CC Houston CAP COM.

	Page 53
04 43 15 C We've been tumbling around.  I don't even know
exactly where we are, but it looks like we're about
over Texas.
04 43 24 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 43 25 C As a matter of fact, you know that looks like
Houston down below us.
04 43 31 P I believe it is, Jim.
04 43 33 C Sure is, I - hey, Gus, I don't know if you can read,
but we're right over Houston.
04 43 34 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 43 35 P That's right. I'm looking right down on Houston.
04 43 40 C Run out and look!
04 43 41 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 43 42 P My golly! I'm looking right in the bay there.
04 43 45 C Yes, that's Galveston Bay right there.
04 43 46 P Yes.
04 43 47 C Ed, can you see in your side of the spacecraft?
04 43 50 P Let me get a picture of it.
04 43 54 C Can you see the camera here?
04 43 55 P Yes.
04 43 57 C Is it pointing at you?
04 43 58 P No, not now. I'm out of it.
04 44 00 C Which way?
04 44 02 P I'm behind the adapter. I'm trying to get some
pictures. I'm right above my hatch now.
04 44 08 C Okay.
04 44 10 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
04 44 15 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
04 44 16 P Yes, sir. If I had about another couple of bottles,
Jim ...
04 44 20 C That would really be it, huh?
04 44 22 P Yes. I'm still not satisfied with the pictures I'm
getting. I've only gotten about three or four.
04 44 24 CC Gemini 4, Houston.

	Page 54
04 44 28 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
04 44 33 C Is that right? I've taken a lot, but they're not
very good.  You're too close for most of them.
04 44 40 P Okay.
04 44 41 C I finally put the focus down to about 8 feet or
so. Oh yes, that's great, the clouds on water behind
you.
04 44 45 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
04 44 53 P Okay. I'm going to let myself go out now.
04 44 59 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
04 45 07 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
04 45 12 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
04 45 12 C You know, Ed, this thing about the reference we were
talking about looks like it was sure right.
04 45 17 P Out here you don't even need one.
04 45 18 C Yes.
04 45 20 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
04 45 24 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
04 45 25 C I'm going out to PUSH-TO-TALK and see what the Flight
Director has got to say.
04 45 33 C Gus, this is Jim. Got any message for us?
04 45 35 CC Gemini 4, get back in!
04 45 36 C Okay.
04 45 41 P One, what are we over now, Jim?
04 45 45 C I don't know. We're coming over the West now, and
they want you to come back in now.
04 45 47 P Back in?
04 45 48 C Back in.
04 45 50 CC Roger, we've been trying to talk to you for awhile
here.
04 45 50 P Aw, Cape, let me just find a few pictures.
04 45 51 C No, back in. Come on.
04 45 54 P Coming in. Listen, you could almost not drag me
in, but I'm coming.

	Page 55
04 46 00 C You still have 3 and a 1/2 more days to go, buddy.
04 46 02 P I know *
04 46 10 P I'm coming.
04 46 14 C Okay.
04 46 15 CC You have about 4 minutes until Bermuda LOS.
04 46 20 CC You have about 4 minutes till Bermuda LOS, Jim.
04 46 36 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 46 38 P ...
04 46 39 C Okay, okay. Don't wear yourself out now. Just
come on in.
04 46 55 C How are you doing there?
04 46 56 P I'm doing great.
04 46 57 C Good. ECS O<sub>2</sub> ... is back in order.
04 46 59 P All right.
04 47 00 C Lots of pressure ... 47 pounds ...
04 47 05 P Roger.
04 47 12 C The spacecraft really looks like it's out-gassing
because all the - whenever a little piece of dirt
or something goes by it always heads for the door
and goes right on out.
04 47 26 C Okay, let's - oops, take it easy now. Take it easy.
04 47 30 P ... I'm standing on top of it, right now.
04 47 32 C Okay, ready on top. Come on in.
04 47 39 C Boy, this load on our spacecraft is fantastic. You
can put in a 2 deg/sec attitude change in nothing
flat! Can't you get a hold there, Ed?
04 47 51 P Yeah ... now.
04 47 56 C Okay.
04 47 56 P It's no sweat. Actually, I'm trying to get a better
picture.
04 47 58 C No, come on in.
04 48 00 P I'm trying to get a picture of the spacecraft now.
04 48 02 C Ed, come on in here!
04 48 05 P All right. Let me fold the camera and put the gun
up.

	Page 56
04 48 10 CC Gemini 4, do you read Houston?
04 48 15 P Ask them about no. 8.
04 48 18 C What?
04 48 19 P Ask them about no. 8.
04 48 20 C No. 8? Okay, how's no. 8?
04 48 26 C Okay. Let's not lose that camera now. I don't
quite have it. A little bit more, but easy, easy,
easy.
04 48 32 P Got it?
04 48 33 C Okay, I've got it.
04 48 34 P Okay, now I can enter ... It's just like we said ...
04 48 40 C Yes, we sort of talked about that. But we sort of
talked about that but they didn't have any place
for the camera. Come on, let's get back here before
it gets dark.
04 48 46 P Okay. This is the saddest moment of my life.
04 48 53 C Well, you're going to find a sadder one when we
have to come down from this whole thing.
04 49 00 P I'm coming.
04 49 01 C Okay.
04 49 04 P ...
04 49 08 C Come on now.
04 49 15 C Okay.
04 49 17 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 49 20 C Be sure you've got those hatch dogs fixed now.
04 49 22 P Yes ...

04 49 32 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 49 44 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 49 47 C I just took all that stuff down there and ...
Okay, I'm going to PUSH-TO-TALK now. I couldn't
... interphone.
04 49 57 C Okay, have any messages for us, Houston?
04 49 59 CC Are you getting him back in?
04 50 04 C He's standing in the seat now. His legs are down
below the instrument panel.

	Page 57
04 50 08 CC Okay. Get him back in. You are going to have
Bermuda LOS in about 20 seconds.
04 50 12 C Yes, he's coming in. He's having some trouble
getting back into the spacecraft it looks like.
04 50 18 CC You got your cabin lights up bright in case you
hit darkness?
04 50 21 C I can't read you. Say again.
04 51 00 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Give me a status.
04 51 18 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
04 51 28 C Go ahead, this is Gemini 4.
04 51 30 CC Roger. Is he getting back in, Jim?
04 51 33 C Listen, we are kind of busy. If you don't really
have something for us, wait a couple of seconds.
04 51 41 CC Roger.
04 52 46 CC Gemini 4, we have about another minute. Could you
give me your status before ...

05 07 57 CC Jim, if you're trying to transmit, you're completely
unreadable. I'm getting nothing but noise.
05 08 15 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Give me your status.
05 08 37 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
05 14 40 P That was something.
05 14 47 P That was the most natural feeling, Jim.
05 14 50 C Yeah. I know it. You looked like you were in your
mother's womb.
05 14 52 P I felt like ...
05 14 55 C That's the same position ... that we're taking
right now, you know this is quite comfortable.
05 14 59 P Yes.
05 15 02 C Now we got the UTD and all this other jazz.
05 15 07 P And they're full.
05 15 21 P Can you put that ...
05 15 21 C ...
05 15 23 P I'm just trying to get them all out, Jim.
05 15 23 C Yes, that's okay.
05 15 26 C But you had a bag of that stuff over here someplace ...

	Page 59
05 15 28 P Yes, I know it.
05 15 33 P Did you get it right-side up?
05 15 33 C Yeah, we're coming around slowly.
05 15 35 P Okay.
05 15 41 P I'll be going off COM here in a minute.
05 15 43 C Okay. Now just take it easy when you pull that
thing over because you'll really back ...
05 15 45 C Easy, easy now.
05 15 49 C Okay. Now wait a minute. It's hooked onto something
down there.
05 15 55 C It's hooked onto the junk. Okay, you got it.
05 15 59 C Okay, what's this thing right here?
05 16 02 C Gemini RCS scanner.
05 16 07 P That's probably been knocked off during the exercise.
05 16 14 P Okay. I'm ready to go off. I'll be off for just a
couple of minutes.
05 17 04 C Hello there.
05 17 07 P I'm back on.
05 17 21 P I'm going to leave this thing open 'til I cool off.
05 17 23 C Let me help you.
05 17 26 C Cabin reading ...
05 17 33 P Yes.
05 17 35 P Okay. Would you undo the tether to the arm rest?
05 17 45 C Yes, you know that was a smart trick of ours, not
going when the ...
05 17 50 P Yes it was, Jim.
05 17 52 P It might just have saved our cans.
05 17 59 P It's not so bad down there.
05 18 02 C Okay. We're coming right-side up again, I think.
05 18 07 P Let's try to get hold of somebody and tell them.
05 18 09 C I don't know what - who we can get a hold of. Let
me check.
05 18 11 P Who's knocking on the back there?
05 18 13 C Ha! ha! ha! Here, let's put this away.

	Page 60
05 18 16 P All right.  Hand me ... all right.
05 18 19 C Now let me hand you this stuff.
05 18 21 P You know, I know my camera was turning. I could
feel it.
05 18 26 C I couldn't feel mine.
05 18 28 C I didn't turn it on until we pressurized and then
I couldn't feel it.
05 18 32 P Okay. Would you look for the bag for that stuff.
05 18 35 C Yes, I got it.
05 18 43 C Lay it here.
05 18 47 C You get the flight plan out and see who we can talk
to.
05 19 02 C 5:15
05 19 09 C Shoot! We don't talk to anybody until we get to
Carnarvon at 5:35. Tananarive is ...
05 19 16 C Houston, do you read Gemini 4?
05 19 21 C Gemini 4, transmitting in the blind. We're back in.
The cabin's resealed. We're all set and all safe.
05 19 38 C We're going to do a delayed time tape playback over
Carnarvon.
05 19 40 P All right.
05 19 47 C At about 5:33, just about 13 minutes ...
05 19 49 P Right.
05 19 57 P We are starting to get cleaned up, Jim.
05 19 59 C Yes, we are. One thing, Ed. Just be slow, cautious
and thorough.
05 20 04 P Roger. I'm slow ...
05 20 06 C I know you are. I'm amazed. I never thought I'd
see the day you would be so slow.
05 20 21 P You know that was just - we rehearsed this so many
times.
05 20 24 C Boy, it really paid off.
05 20 26 P It's paid! Big dividends!
05 20 27 C As a matter of fact, I think I'm going to tell Chris
that on the radio.

	Page 61
05 20 32 P Don't alarm them.
05 20 33 C No, I'm just going to tell them some of that training
just paid off. We could get the hatch closed.
05 20 40 P I tell you, the work I've done with those Crew Systems
boys paid off.
05 20 45 P I knew this equipment pretty well.
05 20 50 C Yes. You knew how hard you could hit it without
hurting it.
05 20 52 P Yes.
05 20 55 C Listen. I'd like to have you take it easy on your
visor from now on, too.
05 20 57 P Yes, I did that just after we got in orbit.
05 21 08 C I tell you. The day side just isn't long enough
for EVA. You know that?
05 21 11 P No. You have to go like gangbusters.
05 21 15 C Are we on RECORD now?
05 21 16 P Yes.
05 21 17 C Yes.
05 21 19 C Note that recorder. You just don't have time.
05 21 35 C That looks ... on one ... I'm going to go to ...
05 21 36 P Okay.
05 21 37 C How's our voltage doing?
05 21 40 P I checked them just before I went out. They were
good. Controls 27. S-2 is 28. S-1 is 28. The
main is 23. We're in good shape.
05 21 56 P I'm starting to cool off good, too.
05 21 58 C Okay.
05 22 40 C What are you going to do with your sleeves, Ed?
You still want to take them off?
05 22 43 P I don't know. I could take them off and stick them
above my feet.
05 22 47 C We'll worry about that later. That's not ...
05 22 49 P Yes. Let's not get encumbered any more.
05 22 59 C ...
05 23 30 P Did you ever get your seat safety pin in?

	Page 62
05 23 32 C No.  I never even tried.  I haven't done anything.
I'm still all latched up.
05 23 38 C I've got my shoulder harness on, my lap belt on,
my life vest on, my ...
05 23 53 P I had it in a hole there. What hole's it in? The
hole's ... Like shooting in the dark. Ah! There's
the hole.
05 24 14 P You know, I looked down there. I thought I saw my
D-ring sitting out. But I feel it now, it's in the
housing.
05 24 19 C No, it never came out.
05 24 21 P I guess I was seeing some other strap. Man, I
about ... when I did that. I thought I'd ...
I didn't want to put my heel into it as I came in.
05 24 31 P Wonder what that strap was down there? Because I
feel my box is all closed now. You didn't close it
did you?
05 24 38 C No.
05 24 40 P Guess it was some other - there were an awful lot of
lanyards floating around.
05 24 57 P You haven't gotten anybody, huh?
05 24 59 C No. We got about another 8 minutes yet.
05 25 03 P Coming up on Carnarvon?
05 25 04 C Carnarvon? Yes.
05 25 21 P I wonder if we ought to put our HF antenna out and
see if that guy can call us?
05 25 24 C No, let's wait until we get to Carnarvon.
05 25 33 C Yes. Okay. Why don't we go ahead and do that?
That might be a good idea.
05 25 35 P Yes, I think it is. HF antenna's coming out.
05 25 43 C I'll go to HF and give them a call.
05 25 54 P Eureka! I got it in.
05 26 39 C Gemini Net, Gemini Net. This is Gemini 4, Gemini 4
on HF. Does anyone read?
05 26 54 C Gemini Net, Gemini Net. This is Gemini 4, Gemini 4
on HF. Does anyone read?
05 27 14 P I think we are upside down, Jim.

	Page 63
05 27 15 C No we're not.
05 27 18 C I think we're right side up, Ed. The ball shows it.
05 27 26 P No, we're all right. I'm sorry.
05 27 27 C Yes.
05 27 28 P The mirror was covering up part of it.
05 27 35 C Gemini Net, Gemini Net, Gemini 4 on HF. Does anyone
read on HF?
05 27 41 C You know this Hasselblad magazine that has the EVA
on it?
05 27 46 P Yes.
05 27 47 C On the ...
05 27 48 P Right.

05 32 51 C Loud and clear. It's nice to have someone to talk
to again.
05 32 54 CC Roger. It's good to hear you. How are things going?

	Page 64
05 32 56 C Okay. We are back inside the spacecraft. We are
repressurized to 5 psi. We are not, I say again,
we are not going to depressurize the spacecraft
again.
05 33 05 CC Roger. Understand. How are you feeling?
05 33 07 C Say again.
05 33 09 CC How are you feeling?
05 33 11 C Everybody's fine. Feeling great.
05 33 14 CC Roger. Can you give me battery readouts please.
05 33 19 C Battery readouts coming up.
05 33 21 CC Roger.
05 33 27 C Before I give the battery readout, do you want me
to stay powered up, or do you want me to start
powering down?
05 33 33 CC Negative. I would like you to keep the power on
your computer on until I update your time and load
and then we will power you down.
05 33 39 C Okay, I'm going to bring the computer on the line
now. It's not on.
05 33 43 CC That's affirmative. I was just going to ask you
to do that.
05 33 48 CC If your platform is off, you can leave it off.
05 33 50 P ... A is 6 and 1/2, 1A is 24 volts.
05 33 55 CC Say it again, please.
05 33 58 P Roger. 1A and 1B are 6 and 1/2 volts, rather
that's amps, and 24 volts.
05 34 06 CC Go ahead.
05 34 09 C 1C is 7 amps and 24 volts.

05 34 22 CC Roger.
05 34 24 C 2C is 6 1/2 and 24. And they look good. RCS A and
B are both holding up fine.

	Page 65
05 34 30 CC Roger. We're going to give you a GO for 6-4. I'll
update a 4-4 load for you with maneuver and 6-4
without maneuver time.
05 34 39 C Stand by one, please.
05 34 41 CC Roger.
05 34 58 C Carnarvon, while we are waiting for that we got all
this equipment in the spacecraft right now and we
are trying to get it stowed away in some reasonable
pattern.
05 35 06 CC Okay, I understand. I am going to update your command
load first and then we will copy the times
when you are ready.
05 35 10 P We are ready right now.
05 35 12 CC Okay. Transmitting a TR.
05 35 16 P Got it.
05 35 17 CC Roger. Got it in.
05 35 20 CC And you got a valid 4-4 load without ... maneuver
load.
05 35 25 P Understand we're good for 4-4.
05 35 27 CC Roger. Okay. We are ready to copy your times.
05 35 30 P Ready to go.

3+00. 8+43.
05 36 09 CC Affirmative. This will be done in the following
manner. The burn, 110 aft, 43 forward.
05 36 22 P Roger. 110 aft, 43 forward.
05 36 26 CC Roger. You can power down your platform and computer
at this time.
05 36 30 P Roger. Clear to power down.
05 36 32 CC Okay. You can turn your Quantity Read Switch to
OFF.
05 36 37 P Quantity's OFF.
05 36 38 CC Roger.
05 36 46 C We're going to power down our rate gyros and some
of the other things at this time also.

	Page 66
05 36 51 CC Roger. Do you want to copy down some 6-4 times?
05 36 55 P Stand by. Ready - go ahead.

That's it.
05 37 28 P Roger. Will you read back the Greenwich Mean Time
and retro command on 6-4? I got the delta-V 00, delta-T 00.
8+12. 16+19. And I didn't copy on the retro time.
05 37 44 CC Roger. That is 01 days 00 08 54.
05 37 52 P Roger. Understand 00 08 54. Got it.
05 37 58 P Roger.
05 38 00 CC Okay, we've set your adapter C-band beacon to
COMMAND.
05 38 03 C Roger. We'll set it to COMMAND.
05 38 05 CC Okay. I'm going to cut it off.
05 38 12 C Carnarvon, this is Gemini 4. It looks like our
booster is still out there flashing away.
05 38 16 CC Roger. How far do you think it is?
05 38 19 C I really can't tell. It looks like it is about
5 or 6 miles perpendicular to our Flight Plan.
Maybe it's more than that. It could be as far out
as 20 miles perpendicular to it.
05 38 32 CC Roger. Is your Adapter C-band in COMMAND now?
05 38 34 C Roger. It is.
05 38 40 CC Okay, looks like I'm unable to turn it off.

05 59 29 P While I was outside I noticed on Jim's window - 
he's got a coating on the outside of it. One time
when I brushed up against it with with either my shoulder
or my arm it actually smeared right over on it, and
it smeared the upper part of his windshield so that
he couldn't see out. When I look out from this side,
I can see that it is rather heavily coated with some
type of material. When I was outside looking in, it
looked like a - it looked like almost a greasy film
on the outside of it. My window doesn't seem to have
as much on it. When we have the sun on it...
05 59 57 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM on UHF. Do you read?
06 00 04 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
06 00 08 C This is Gemini 4. Go ahead.
06 00 08 CC Roger. Would you position your real time T/M
switch to the COMMAND position?
06 00 18 C Say again.
06 00 20 CC Would you position your real time T/M switch to the
COMMAND position?
06 00 24 C Roger. Our T/M switch is in REAL TIME and ACQ -
is in COMMAND position.
06 00 29 CC Roger. Understand in COMMAND position. Also would
like to know what time you closed the hatch.
06 00 45 C Stand by.
06 00 57 C Stand by a moment. We'll try to figure it out for
you.
06 01 00 C Just a second, Ed.
06 01 04 C This is Gemini.
06 02 14 C This is Gemini 4. Who was calling me before?
06 02 17 CC This is Hawaii, Gemini 4.
06 02 38 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
06 02 49 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
06 03 18 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. If you copy, all systems
on the ground look good.

06 05 14 P It looks like in our power-down * we're
still pulling just a little less than 11 amps.  We've
got 10 on no. 1 and a little less than 11 on no. 2.
The tether - the location of the tether or the umbilical
restraint on the outside hatch made it
rather difficult to do any EVA work as far as free
tether aerodynamics out in front of the spacecraft.
Whenever I'd be operating out in that area, the
tether would - when it would come to its end would
start me back and the reaction would carry me back
up towards the - over the spacecraft and back toward
the adapter section.  That's why I kept going out of
sight during my maneuvering out there up above the
windows, and then drifting back toward the back of
the spacecraft. I continually had to keep pulling
myself to get out in the front part of the spacecraft.
I wasn't satisfied with the pictures that
I was getting. It was rather difficult to keep
any of the lanyards that I had on ... I had the
lanyard on the gun and the tether and umbilical
that I was on, and several other miscellaneous type
lanyards flailing around and it was difficult to
keep them from in front of the camera. You'll
notice that perhaps in the pictures that I'll be
moving my arms rapidly. I kept trying to move them
out of the way so that I could take a picture. I'd
say they were in front of me probably about 50 or
60 percent of the time; and the other percent of the
time I was not in as good a position as I would like
to be. I think I probably took in the neighborhood
of a dozen pictures. It does seem quite easy to
operate, even just with the tether out there. I
felt no tendency to bang into the spacecraft. I was
able to approach the spacecraft just about from any
attitude I came back in - and sometimes when I was
coming ...
06 07 32 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
06 07 43 C Go ahead, this is Gemini 4.
06 07 45 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. We would like
to get a Medical Data Pass, Type 1, on the Pilot
at an elapsed time of 6 hours and 12 minutes.
That'll be over Texas. That will be about 21 28 00 Z. 
He can set up his oral temperature,
and we'll give you a call when we have a read-out
on it.

06 09 21 CC Roger. The Cape would like to get a Medical Data
Pass One on the Pilot. Recommend he inserts the
oral temperature right now, so we can get a readout
over at the Cape.
06 09 32 C Roger, he is inserting the oral temperature probe
at this time.
06 09 37 CC Roger. We are planning a dump over Texas. Request
you assume a heads-up attitude.
06 09 42 C Roger. We are assuming a heads-up attitude, Be
advised we do not have the exerciser out; we will
not be able to give you the Type 1.
06 09 54 CC Roger. Understand.
06 10 05 CC Gemini 4, Guaymas. Are you ready for your HF check?

06 10 43 CC Roger. Back on UHF.
06 10 45 C Roger. How did you read me?
06 10 56 C ... alerting someone, anyone, on HF to let them
know that we got back in, but I got no response at
all.
06 11 04 CC Say again.

	Page 70
06 11 06 C I say after we get back in the spacecraft I tried
to call on HF to alert someone that we were back in,
but I received no response.
06 11 16 CC Roger. I'll pass that along.
06 11 41 CC All systems are GO on the ground here.
06 11 44 C Affirmative. GO.
06 12 16 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
06 12 25 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
06 12 31 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.

06 13 03 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
06 13 14 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. If you read, we
have the oral temperature. The Pilot can remove the
probe.
06 13 20 C Roger, will do.
06 13 22 CC Okay, I'm reading you now. I have an onboard map
update for you. The ascending node is 132° East.
G.m.t. of the node is 21 39 00.
06 13 39 C Roger. Say again the longitude of the ascending
node.
06 13 45 CC Roger. It's 132° East.
06 13 50 C Roger. 132° East and 21 39 00.
06 13 55 CC That's affirmative and would you put your ECS O<sub>2</sub>
switch to OFF.
06 14 05 C Which ECS O<sub>2</sub> switch to OFF?.
06 14 10 CC All right, that's the heater switch. Your waste
valve Off. Your EVA bottle empty and ZIP GUN
empty.
06 14 22 C Say again Houston CAP COM. You're difficult to
read.
06 14 25 CC We want your waste valve off, and empty the EVA
bottle.
06 14 37 C Roger.
06 14 38 CC Okay. If you don't have anything I'm going to turn
you over to SIR JOHN for this Medical Data One, as
much as we can get.

	Page 71
06 14 45 C SIR JOHN, Gemini 4.
06 14 56 CC Okay, we'll turn you over to SIR JOHN, Gemini 4.
06 15 00 S Okay. Ed, we understand that you do not have the
exerciser out, so would you go ahead and pump up
the cuff, and we'll do without the exerciser.
We'll get a single blood pressure.
06 15 15 P Roger, Ed. I'll be pumping it up again ...
06 15 18 S All right.
06 15 41 S Ed, we don't see any cuff response yet.
06 15 46 P I pumped it all the way up.
06 15 49 S Does it feel firm to you?
06 15 51 P Yes, quite firm. I'm ...
06 15 56 S Okay, let her bleed, Ed.
06 15 59 P Roger, and we'll pass it on to you now. I've had
about 12 swallows of water and I think Jim probably
had 10. Also, we haven't eaten anything yet and
we're awfully hungry.
06 16 16 S Real great. Listen Ed, we want to modify the Flight
Plan and we would like to have the sleep period
changed here and let you get some rest. We'd like
to have you go for at least 4 hours right now and
it's perfectly agreeable with Chris if we go ahead
and have Jim sleep some of this period, too if he
gets sleepy during that period. It's agreeable
to Chris.
06 16 45 P Understand you'd like me to go to sleep for a little
while.
06 16 49 S Roger. We'd like for you to go to sleep. For
4 hours, anyway.
06 16 54 P I'm not too sleepy; however, I'll ...
06 16 59 S Okay, let's give it a try. Could I confirm one
thing with you too, Ed? When you were EVA, we got
a transmission that there was no disorientation,
and that was affirmative for the entire time. Is
that correct?

	Page 72
06 17 14 P There was no disorientation whatsoever. I felt
that I could either look down at the ground - I
felt perfectly at home looking down at it - and I
could roll around on my back and look up and it was
not disorienting me in any way. The spacecraft was
my best reference. Any time I saw it I immediately
had a good reference and, in fact at times near the
end I was using my tether and actually walking up
and down on the surface of the spacecraft, using it
to hold me down, as somewhat of an anchor.
06 17 48 S Oh, that sounds terrific. Wonderful.
06 17 52 P There just isn't any disorientation whatsoever.
06 17 53 S Let's go on that sleep period. If Jim has no arguments
about that, that's the end of the transmission
here then.
06 18 24 CC This is Cape. Go ahead 4.
06 18 26 CC Go ahead 4.
06 18 30 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
06 18 37 C Houston CAP COM. Gemini 4.
06 18 39 CC Go ahead, Gemini 4.
06 18 41 C I would like a little flight information here ...
06 18 43 CC Roger.
06 18 44 C Just what the plan is now with the fuel remaining,
or how are we going to handle the fuel?
06 18 52 CC As best as I can tell you right now, you'll be able
to accomplish practically all of the Flight Plan
with the fuel that you have remaining at this time.
We'll keep updating you in real time. Right now
we want you to get some sleep. As far as your
Apollo D-9 goes, it looks like you're going to be
too far from the booster.
06 19 10 C Okay, if Ed sleeps, and if I see it, I'll go ahead
and use the sextant.
06 19 15 CC Right. If you do see it, you might unstow the
sextant, but I wouldn't recommend you unstow it
before you see it because it looks like you are
going to be plenty far from it.
06 19 22 C Okay, now I saw it on the last orbit so maybe I'll
see it on the next one.
06 19 28 CC Gemini 4, from Cape.

	Page 73
06 19 30 C Go ahead Cape.
06 19 31 CC Looks like we won one after all.
06 19 33 C Ha! Ha!
06 19 41 CC Gemini 4, from Houston Flight.
06 19 45 C Go ahead Houston Flight, Gemini 4.
06 19 47 CC Give us about a day to find the true anomaly, Jim,
to see whether we can really do any of these OAMS
retros. For instance 6-4, we didn't have enough
fuel so there wouldn't have been any argument.
06 19 58 C Okay, I'll go ahead and proceed with the Flight
Plan as we've got it now. Is that correct?
06 20 03 CC Affirmative.
06 20 05 C Thank you.
06 20 10 C We had a couple of pretty exciting moments there,
Chris.
06 20 12 CC Right.
06 22 41 CC Gemini 4.
06 22 53 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
06 23 07 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
06 23 18 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
06 23 24 P Go ahead, Gemini 4.
06 23 26 CC We want to verify if you're off the long umbilical
and back on your normal suit circuit.
06 23 32 P That's affirmative. We've been off the long umbilical
for some time. At that time we went off
the umbilical onto the suit ECS circuit.
06 23 45 CC Roger. Have a good nap.
06 23 47 P Roger.
06 23 55 C Houston CAP COM, this is Gemini 4.
06 24 04 C Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4.
06 24 05 CC Go ahead Gemini 4.
06 24 07 C I never did understand what ECS O<sub>2</sub> switch you
wanted me to turn off.
06 24 12 CC Roger. It's the ECS O<sub>2</sub> heater switch. Heater
switch.

	Page 74
06 24 17 C How come you want that off?
06 24 23 CC ... says we won't need it anymore.  The pressure
will sustain itself.
06 24 27 C Okay, fine. We're still up about 42 percent.
06 24 28 CC Roger, you're reading 42 percent.
06 34 35 C It's now 6+35 elapsed, and I'm powering down the
spacecraft completely. We had turned off the platform
and the computer earlier after checking with
ground and completing our EVA. I'm powering down
the rest of it at this time.
06 36 47 P I'm turning Biomed Recorder no. 1 off at this time.
This is a change from the Flight Plan due to the
different sleeping arrangements.
06 37 27 P Okay, Blackie.
06 37 29 C Ha! Ha! Ha! What are we going to do with all this
stuff?
06 37 32 P I don't know.
06 37 40 C ... ES sensor ... ?
06 37 44 P Yep. Let's turn it off, too.
06 37 47 C Let's turn it off.
06 37 49 P The ES sensor is coming off at this time.
06 38 06 P I think we ought to make a big effort to get a
full meal at this time, Jim.
06 38 11 C I think so. I'm about starved to death.
06 38 14 P Ha! Ha! Bacon and egg bites.
06 38 18 C Oh?
06 38 19 P Yes. Ha! Ha! Ha!
06 38 23 C For me, too?
06 38 24 P Ha! Ha! Ha! Yes.
06 38 27 C ...
06 38 29 P Can you keep all that stuff on ... ?
06 38 44 P I swear, I get the feeling I'm standing on my head
here.
06 38 50 C Yes, me too.
06 38 54 P Maybe it's because you're always touching the
ceiling.

	Page 75
06 38 56 C Yes.
06 39 05 P Good boy! You putting some log data in?
06 39 07 C Yes.
06 39 08 P Back up that tape?
06 41 04 C Continuing what I was debriefing about the booster,
early in the flight. After we entered the darkness,
at what I consider to be a distance of 1200 feet,
I tried station-keeping with it, but the only thing
I had to judge my distance from the booster at that
time was the distance between the flashing lights.
Occasionally they would - not occasionally, but
continually, I would see one light, then two lights,
and then one light, and then sometimes there'd be
a long time before I'd see two lights - indicating
that the booster was rotating all the time. I
really didn't have too much of a clue as to which
way it was going. Based on the distance between
the lights, when I could see both of them, I felt
that I was in a real good position with it until
we got to about Carnarvon. At that time I seemed
to be closing rather rapidly, although I couldn't
really be sure of this. All the delta-V I'd added up
to that time had been in the direction of the
booster, or retrograde. Unfortunately, the darned
booster would get in position such that if I were
going to close on it, I would have to apply a posigrade
to close, which then, in turn, caused me to
once again depart from it after a period of time
had gone by. Then with the 45 - 40 minutes of
darkness, I really had a difficult time telling
where I was. As we came out of the darkness, the
booster was below me and pulling away from me quite
rapidly. Ed, how far away below us do you think it
was?
06 43 01 P Oh, I don't know. I'd estimate it was probably out
there a mile and a half or two.
06 43 06 C Yes.
06 43 06 P It's very difficult to estimate when it gets to be
that far.
06 43 08 C It certainly was. I sort of felt that it was probably
between one and two miles, and I couldn't
really tell how far out.

	Page 76
06 43 18 C Definitely below me. I'd been tracking it below
me from about Carnarvon on. Up until about
Carnarvon we had it below us, and then up to the
horizon, and then down below us again. It almost
looked like it was in a different orbit than I was.
It had a different apogee and perigee than what I
did. Anyway, I attempted to close with it at daylight
as soon as I could tell where it was. As I
said, at that time it was a mile or two out in
front of me - down below me. So, the more I tried
to close, the less I really gained on it. I was
firing retrograde. I was using my top thrusters
to fire in such a manner as to decrease my total
velocity, and then firing ... at the same time.
I never really closed, and it continued to pull
away from me. It became obvious to me that by the
time we got to Hawaii that to close on the booster
in time to do the EVA with the booster would probably
take all the fuel we had onboard. In the
ground rule we had agreed not to do this. So I
checked with CAP COM and we decided to not go ahead
with the booster portion of the mission. I don't
know if I mentioned it, but when we separated from
the booster, it seemed like our rates on the booster
were low, on the order of a half a degree a second
in pitch and yaw. I tried to damp these. I fired
one impulse in each direction, and then I concentrated
on coming off the booster. We came off, and
we came off in the manner in which we generated
some other rates. We came right-side-up, eventually,
and turned around. Probably about a minute and a
half or two minutes. It looked like the big problem
was the time I took out to semi-aline the platform
before we went into the dark side. We'd probably
gotten right on top of the booster instantaneously.
If I'd ignored the platform we would have been able
to go ahead and complete it. On the other hand, I
wanted to make sure we had a reasonably good alinement
prior to getting to our 2-1 GO-NO GO point in
case anything went wrong.
06 46 04 C What's that? Gum?
06 46 06 P Yes.

	Page 77
06 46 08 C As the booster departed us, you could see the fuel
spraying out of the roll nozzle. As the booster
tumbled around, mostly in a plane that would be
perpendicular to a line through the major axis of
the spacecraft to the booster, you could see the
long flowing tail that came out of it. I'm going
to draw a short little picture of that on my flight
plan. There was debris all over at spacecraft
separation. We turned around and there were things
all over the place. As a matter of fact, until we
really got a good look at the booster, I really
couldn't tell what was what. Fairings came off
right at fairing jett with no problem. The horizon
scanner fairings looked like they came off intact
but I couldn't really tell because it disappeared
out of sight so last. I didn't see the nose fairing
come off at all.
06 47 36 C I never did get an accelerometer bias to check on
the platform. I was thrusting most of the time
there, and unable to really settle the thing down
for any length of time. We skipped a couple tape
dumps I guess, because of the peculiar attitude
that we were in. I could not contact Carnarvon
very well on the first pass. It's a shame we
didn't have a camera out right when we separated
because ...
06 48 33 P Boy! That was beautiful.
06 48 40 C Nice. What? g?
06 48 42 P No. That first view of that booster.
06 48 45 C Oh yes. That was really nice, wasn't it?
06 48 45 P That was beautiful.
06 48 46 C That was really nice all right.
06 48 50 C Just the way it should have been.
06 48 51 P Just exactly!
06 48 52 C How far out do you think we were when we first
saw it? I think we must have been at least
500 feet out when we first got around.
06 48 57 P Oh, we were closer than that.
06 48 58 C Do you think so?
06 48 59 P Oh yes. I'd say we were in the neighborhood of ...
06 49 02 C Remember, it's only ...

	Page 78
06 49 04 C It's 130 feet long - the whole thing, I mean. Just
as a reference, from the pad to our spacecraft was
only about 130 feet long.
06 49 13 P Yes.
06 49 14 C Okay.
06 49 18 P I'd estimate we were out about a little over
200 feet.
06 49 20 C Think so?
06 49 21 P Yes.
06 49 22 C Okay, I would estimate ...
06 49 22 P Boy, it was sitting right out there!
06 49 23 C ... between five and six hundred feet, but
certainly close enough where you could see it in
all its clarity.
06 49 28 P Going away and the tumbling was starting.
06 49 30 C Right. It didn't take long for that tumbling to
get going.
06 49 35 P Interesting thing, though. The tumbling, really,
as I could see, never appreciably picked up. It
stayed there. It started out ...
06 49 42 C You know what it looked like to me?
06 49 44 P What?
06 49 45 C It looked like it was tumbling in an oscillatory
manner. It would tumble for a while and then it
looked like, as it burped or the fuel came out or
something, it would change its orientation and
pull over in another way.
06 49 56 P Yes, but it never seemed to go ... I timed
them ... looked like ...
06 49 59 C The rates ... Yes, the total rate never really
seemed to pick up good in whatever it was. What
was it? Eight seconds/rev?
06 50 05 P Eight seconds/revolution. I timed them.
06 50 06 C Okay. Let me write that down so we don't forget it.
06 50 10 C Starting over the United States, actually Ed started
unstowing things just as soon as we got into orbit.
I think that we could unstow without jeopardizing
the possibility of a safe 2-1 reentry.

	Page 79
06 51 01 P What's that down there below us? Over there.
06 51 06 C Looks like a city or something.
06 51 11 P Are we upside-down?
06 51 13 C I think we're pointing right down at the ground.
06 51 18 C Ed started on unstowing stuff and as soon as we got
to the position where it became no longer feasible
to fool with the booster, I started full-time
helping him - at least holding the things and stowing
them away and trying to keep them from disappearing.
The faster we worked the farther behind we
got. Not because we weren't putting things the way
they were supposed to, it just took a lot longer
than we had anticipated. It really wasn't much
easier at zero g than it was in the simulator, if
as easy. So we worked all the way around. By the
time we got to Carnarvon, I had made up my mind
that we couldn't make it, but I thought we'd forge
on a little longer. By the time we got to - or
just before we even left Carnarvon it was clear to
me that we could not make the depressurization. I
called for a slip to the next orbit. We then ...
caught our breath for about 20 minutes and tried to
sort out the junk I had laying around in the cockpit.
Then I got the checklist out and we went
through the checklist again in detail to make sure
that we hadn't skipped anything in the rush. Started
the extravehicular - got the GO over Carnarvon.
We were all set to go and we were standing by for
the GO to start depressurizing. We got it. Went
through the depressurization cycle. As we left
Carnarvon, we were cleared for the full EVA. We
got to Canton or Hawaii, and at that time were
given - I believe it was Canton or Hawaii that gave
us the GO to actually exit the spacecraft and start
the extravehicular maneuvers. We accomplished this
as indicated on our tape recorder that we recorded
before and on the VOX position. We went ahead and
Ed got out and we started to take pictures as we -
how we would ... I initially held the spacecraft
fixed for him. Then as he got out and seemed to be
floating around in such a manner that I couldn't
track him - initially, we decided that it was better
to let the thing drift. Is that right?
06 54 25 P That's right.

	Page 80
06 54 25 C He was having difficulty maintaining his orientation,
and it looked to me from then on he oriented
off the spacecraft without regard to which direction
it was pointing. He could actually impart quite
high rates to it, as high as 2° per second. I intended
to keep them below that level. As he got
back into the spacecraft, we had a considerable
amount of difficulty with the hatch. First we
lifted the ratchet portion of the hatch to engage.
After we got that engaged, we couldn't get the
hatch down closed far enough. Actually, we started
pulling down on the locking handles to get the dogs
out. So, we had a rather exciting time and I think
it was on tape, wasn't it Ed? I had the tape recorder
on, I believe.
06 55 24 P The tape recorder was on, but the red light lit
there sometime. I don't know.
06 55 26 C Okay. So it may be on tape and it may not. It went
on for - I think we were 44 minutes after we started
EVA. I was looking at my event timer which I had
started when Ed exited the spacecraft. At 44 minutes
we still didn't have the hatch closed. We were
trying to take things calm, cool, and collected so
we didn't get things all screwed up. And finally,
by my pulling as hard as I could to get the hatch
closing device, and Ed pulling down as best as he
could, we were able to force him down into the seat
and get the hatch closed fully. Ed seemed to be up
much higher today than he had been in any of our
zero-g EVA in the airplane.
06 56 13 P Jim. I don't think it was the ...
06 56 17 C Go ahead. Say what you said.
06 56 20 P Yes. I don't believe we were actually having difficulty
with the head clearance. I felt like I had
plenty of head clearance and I could actually ...
down and manipulate the dogs. We just seemed to have
a little more effort in closing than we had ever experienced
before and ...
06 56 40 C It was difficult to swing shut because of all the
washers that we have in the pyro lines.

	Page 81
06 57 00 P Right.  I was having to actually manipulate the
gain dogs on the hatch each time that I stroked it,
so that I wasn't able to pull as hard as I usually
had been able to.  So we had to coordinate ourselves
and where I would stroke down on it.  Jim would - I
would instruct him to pull hard at that time and I 
know he was. In that manner we were able to get it
started. Once these dogs started dogging down I
had no trouble with the gain anymore, but I had to
actually engage the gain as we had been instructed
on the first several strokes to get it started down.
06 57 30 C One thing that I don't know if we got on tape before,
but both Ed and I mentioned that we were quite thankful
for all the training that we'd done in the altitude
chamber, in the zero-g airplane, and the crew
procedures trainer there at Houston.
06 57 43 P You're not kidding! I'll second that. The things
that occurred were not things that we hadn't done
before and things that we hadn't worked out procedures
for before. The things that we did, I
think, paid very heavy dividends today. I was very
thankful for all the training that we had and the
work the people had done with us.
06 58 01 C Yes. I was thankful that we didn't have to make a
reentry with the hatch open.
06 58 06 P And another thing, I was glad Jim had been working
with the dumbells a little bit to build up those
muscles.
07 00 46 P On the books, I think we want to be sure we put a
little more care into the kind of rings we use.
We've had difficulty in opening two or three different
times now, and also pages are tearing out so
that they are not staying in the book. We ought to
look into some kind of reinforcement for the holes,
where the rings attach. On the water gun, the little
teat that sticks out the end of it to allow the water
to flow out sticks in the OUT position, just like it
did on the simulator, and allows water to flow after
you take the trigger off. You have to, actually,
from time to time reseat it back up in there to keep
the water from flowing out of the capsule when you
pull the gun out of the food package. Another thing,
on the drinking hose, it's very easy to turn the hose
in such an angle when you're drinking from it to keep
the water from flowing through the hose. Actually,
you crimp the hose right at the end, right where the
rubber attaches to the drinking nozzle gun.

10 43 55 C Roger. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
10 43 59 CC Roger, read you loud and clear. Use minimum fuel,
Gemini 4.
10 44 12 C Were you supposed to get some retrofire times from
RKV before?
10 44 20 CC Roger, I will pass up 8-C to you when we finish the
Com Check.
10 44 22 C Again, please.
10 44 26 CC I will relay Area 8-C to you when we finish the Com
Check.
10 44 32 CC Roger.
10 44 52 C I'm in about 90° right now and I'm starting to come
out.
10 44 56 CC Roger. Still reading you loud and clear.
10 44 59 C Okay, I'm reading you loud and clear, too. I'm
reading you much better than I've read anyone else
in a long time.
10 45 03 CC Roger.
10 45 05 C Nice to talk to somebody, again.
10 45 07 CC Yes, you broke up on a couple of passes over.
10 45 10 C Ed was sleeping. I didn't have anyone on the ground
to talk to and it was kind of quiet. I should say
Ed was trying to sleep.
10 45 21 CC Roger. Has he been sleeping?
10 45 24 C Speak for yourself, Edward. Okay, I'm coming up to
level flight at this time. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
10 45 36 CC Roger. We would like for you to switch to ADAPTER
and give us a short count.

	Page 93
10 45 42 C Roger, I'm on ADAPTER. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. How
do you read me?
10 45 48 CC I read you a little broken up but readable.
10 45 51 C Okay, I'm reading you loud and clear also.
10 45 54 CC Roger. I think this is about the best we've had -
right?
10 46 16 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Be advised to switch back
to REENTRY. Did you copy, Gemini 4?
10 46 23 C Roger. We're on REENTRY now.
10 46 25 CC Roger, understand.
10 46 38 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Will you position your
REAL-TIME ACQ-AID to COMMAND.
10 46 43 C It is on COMMAND.
10 46 45 CC Roger. Roger. Now are you ready to copy your
CLA 8-C?
10 46 57 C Roger, we are.
10 47 01 CC 166, 3+35. 01 02 06 51. 11+18. Did you copy,

11 05 31 P Roger, this is Gemini 4. Pilot got up about 20 minutes
ago and had about 3 and a 1/2 hours of rest.
It wasn't deep sleep. It was an on-and-off type
sleeping, but there was some sleep associated with
it. I had for breakfast, small cereal, orange juice,
bacon and egg bites, and calcified ... bits. I've
had 12 mouthfuls of water in just a few moments.

11 15 10 P Yes. 02 30 59. Holding it there for one minute.
11 15 38 P Why don't you, between each one of these, turn it
off, Jim. When we start going to bed ...
11 15 58 P Going into the crotch area.
11 16 02 C Okay?
11 16 03 P Yes ...
11 16 09 C Wonder if I should put my gloves on?
11 16 14 P ... not as comfortable. I'll tell you that.

11 16 25 P The what?
11 16 26 C The top.
11 16 29 P Yes, why don't you, and I'll stow it while you're in

C If there's an experiment that comes up where you
need me ...
P D-8 is OFF at this time.  This run is completed.
11 45 21 P I took an S-5 picture of a cloud formation over the
Pacific coming on the Coastal Sentry Quebec area at
03:00 using f/11 at 150. It was frame no. 28. I'm
taking several pictures for S-5. I'm right in the
area of the tropical storm Carla. It's very heavily
overcast right now. I'll take a few of the cloud
formations. They have some very interesting formations
interlaced on the top of them. Perhaps the
camera will pick them up. It's so bright I'm going
to shoot 250 at 16. Those will be frames 28, 29,
and I'll be shooting at least two more. Those will
be 30 and 31. I should be passing right over the
area of the storm.
12 02 23 P The Greenwich time is 03:18 and 25 seconds.
12 03 01 P I'm shooting back at 250 at 11 now.
12 03 28 P The Hasselblad hung up on that one. I don't believe
it was a good one.
12 03 35 P That was a good one.
12 04 54 P The shutter to the Hasselblad seems to be delayed in
dropping. I hope it's not ruining - occluding the
pictures.
12 05 29 P Looks like we're pretty well out of the typhoon area.
I'll wait until I get out just a little further and
try to get a broad over-all shot that covers the
whole area.

12 09 12 CC Gemini 4, CSQ. I got cut up by Goddard loop. You
say you didn't get a time of the hatch closure. Do
you have some kind of an estimate?
12 09 22 P Roger. I'll call you down one. Stand by. We've
got it marked up.
12 09 25 CC Well, don't look for it if it's out of place.
12 09 30 P Roger. It was considerably later than we had planned.

	Page 97
12 09 35 CC Roger.
12 09 36 P Everything's going quite well now, up here now.
Jim's gone on to sleep. ... four hours of sleep.
I had a good rest, also and I'm preparing to have a
dinner of roast beef and cream corn.
12 09 51 CC Roger. Roast beef and cream corn.
12 09 54 P Roger ... over the hurricane, or typhoon area
... there right over Carla and ... which ones
they were. I believe I got some good Hasselblad
pictures of them down there, though. It was quite
extensive cloud coverage from above and quite a few
interesting formations.
12 10 14 CC Roger.
12 10 18 P Will you pass on also, that we're delaying D-9 as
our flight plan calls for because we feel that we
both should be up for it. It requires coordination.
12 10 27 CC Roger. Will do.
12 10 33 P Right now the pressure in the cabin is holding about
5.4. It seems to hold up there. That's where she
went at lift-off. It seemed to hold there for a
while and then it gradually drained down to about
4.9.
12 10 46 CC Okay. Okay, everything here on the ground looks
real good.
12 10 54 P Rog.
12 11 02 P It was really quite a view out there during the EVA.
12 11 07 CC I imagine. Real good show.
12 11 12 CC How long did you stay out?
12 11 15 P Must have been out - I came out just as soon as we
got the GO. Before Hawaii, actually, I came out
... following the camera and installing the umbilical
cord. It took a little bit of effort to get
them in ...
12 11 50 CC Gemini 4, CSQ. We've got LOS.
12 18 59 P Took another picture of the cloud formation at
03:35 ... a long drawn-out type formation.
12 27 28 P One of the food bags has leaked at the inflow lid
where you put the water gun.

	Page 98
12 28 42 P I'm looking out at the stars now. it's not as -
it's light, not fully dark. It appears that the
window gives you a filter that cuts down the smaller
magnitude stars. I'm looking out right now at the
Big Dipper and right on down to Arcturus and ... 
and it appears to me that what I'm seeing right now
are primarily the second and down to third order
stars. The smaller ones are cut pretty well out of
the picture at the present time. As you get deeper
into night, I think more of them will come out, but
you definitely don't see as many stars as you do
flying at 40 000 feet in an airplane on a good clear
night.
12 30 59 P The stars of Corvus is right out in view right now.
It seems to be in pretty full view. I'm picking up
probably down to about fourth order stars right now.
12 33 45 P As we get deeper into the night, the other stars are
coming out. I can see them - I believe I can see
down to about fifth magnitude now. It's still not
as brilliant a display of stars as you'd see on a
clear night at 20 000 feet out of the canopy of an
aircraft. I've got my lights dimmed way down and it
makes a much more spectacular view out. As a matter
of fact, the stars seem to be coming out as my eyes
adapt further. I'm looking right now at the Southern
Cross and the stars around it. There seems to
be a somewhat of a lighted area around it.
12 35 11 P I've got a very clear horizon now. It's rather
light and I've got a horizon comprised mainly of
clouds. I can see the clouds - the stars as they
start to go down into the main air glow, but the
clouds seem to give a more light horizon. It doesn't
seem that we - earlier in the flight we've seen a
horizon without clouds and it was much more - it was
a rather thick layer of air glow and you could see
the stars as they went down through it. In this
cloud-type horizon though, the stars are more difficult
to see; although I do note that some of the
brighter ones are visible through it as they set.
12 36 17 P I'm looking out now at Grus, and its stars are quite
clear, even the small fourth and fifth order magnitude
stars in the ... This time of evening and at
night, the skies are quite black and the stars are
quite visible. I can see at least fifth order.

12 39 30 CC Roger. I have a 9-3 update for you.
12 39 33 P Stand by, please.
12 39 45 P Ready to copy.
12 39 47 CC Roger. 9-3: 04 36 19. 07+59. 15+47. Do you copy?
12 40 06 P Roger. 9-3: 04 36 19. 07+59. 15+47.
12 40 18 CC That's affirmative.
12 40 21 P Would you relay to Houston that we were out over
... but we were able to see the coast of Texas
quite clearly and actually picked up ... outside
you could see considerably more ... coastline of
Texas on up around into Louisiana ... coming on
down over the southern part of Florida, I could see
the whole state of Florida, and we went ... and
about that time we had the command to start back in.
12 41 04 CC Sounds real good.
12 41 07 P Quite a view!
12 41 13 P Also relay down that control with the gun was ...
very good in yaw, very good in pitch. Roll control
wasn't as good but when I had the gun, I was able to
pick a spot on the spacecraft and return to it. I
was able to maneuver in translation and also in my
attitude control ...
12 41 39 CC Roger. Understand.

	Page 100
12 41 41 P ... I didn't have the gun though, using the lanyard
was a little more difficult due to the position on
the spacecraft door at which it was attached. It
tended to - like a tether will do, it tended to bring
me back and rebound me off the ... door back toward
the adapter quite a bit of the time, and I spent a
lot of time trying to get out of that area.
12 42 05 CC Roger.
12 42 22 P ... I finished the dinner of roast beef ...
12 42 35 CC Roger, very good. Flight has been copying your
transmissions.
12 42 41 P Roger. Understand.
12 42 57 P Looking at it now, right now. It's a ... triangle.
I can see all three constellations, I think, clearly.
The ... and Vega. In fact, I can see down ...
12 43 37 CC Roger, sounds real good.
12 43 44 P ... pictures.
12 46 44 P I've seen quite a display of stars ... I've seen
the southern hemisphere stars. I've seen the Summer
Triangle, ... Vega, the Northern Cross. Looks
like now I'm coming up - I can see ... I can see
the ...
12 52 12 P I believe that I miscalled a little earlier on the
- that I had a cloud-deck horizon. I definitely
don't have a ground-deck horizon. I can see down
below thunderstorm activity and the stars sinking
down through the air glow. So it's definitely an
air glow horizon. And I estimate it to be approximately
11 to 12° angle, pie section, from my view.
There's quite a display of thunderstorms down below
right now.
12 52 46 P It's starting to get light and I can still see quite
a few stars. I'm going to try to see just what
chance I have of seeing stars on the sunlit side of
this pass.
12 57 36 P Well, I'm back around now to the Southern Cross with
the light splotchy area of - I guess lots of very
light ... stars. I don't recall quite seeing the
same display in the planetarium. Alpha Centauri and
Beta are quite clear. I'm still at this time - it's
starting to get light and I can still see quite a
few stars. I believe they go down to about at least

	Page 101
the sixth order now. I started up about the fourth
and I'm down to sixth. There's really a lot of
stars out in that ...
12 59 00 P The light band of stars seem to - the stars right
around the Southern Cross and the rather dark void
area and the right - on the sign of the Cross and
that as you get back toward Alpha and Beta Centauri
the light area continues. It just looks ... a big
patch of - oh, it looks like we're going to be late.
12 59 32 P It looks just as ... It looks just like ...
As a matter of fact, it probably is. It certainly
is clearly defined, though. You can see the dark
voids - a dark void area, ... in it.
13 00 58 P There's the little Corona Australis, that we decided
to use as a calibration. It's out in front of me
right now,   and they go down to fifth order stars and
I can see stars that are distinctly of a less magnitude
than the stars in the Corona Australis.
13 03 31 P MSC-2 and -3 are being turned OFF at 04 19 40. I'm
afraid I was watching the stars so much I forgot to
turn it off at the proper time.
13 05 30 P Right now it's daylight over on Jim's side, and
looking out my side I can still make out some of
the stars. It appears that you can keep the spacecraft
oriented so that one side is dark. On the
dark side you can see stars: but the other side is
in daylight. Jim's side is definitely in the daylight
right now and mine is in the dark. This is
one of the things that surprised me the most earlier
in the flight when I was looking out at all the
little fireflies from the booster, and remarking how
dark it was and how it looked. I looked over at Jim
and he was looking out of the perfectly daylight
window. That's actually the way it's supposed to be
but was a quite interesting thing - the first time
you see it.
13 15 02 P I just took an S-5 picture. I'm just coming over the
Sahara Desert. It's really a beautiful view. I'll
take several more pictures.
13 17 05 P I took two pictures - 45 and 46. I'm passing over
Africa now, looking down at the Sahara Desert.
13 20 09 P Passing over the east side of Africa now. I see
quite a few ...

can see the atolls and stuff around the islands themselves.
I tried to get a picture of them, but I
caught them just a little too late. They were very
clear and quite easy to pick out.

13 52 20 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Did you receive my last?
13 52 24 P You were all blocked out after ...
13 52 30 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. I say again, 05:56 to 06:16.
Orbital Nav Check using no attitude
fuel. Over.
13 53 07 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM ...
13 53 09 P Houston CAP COM, Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4.
13 53 14 CC Roger, I say again. 05:56 to 06:16, Orbital Nav
Check, using no attitude fuel. Over.
13 53 32 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
13 53 39 P Go ahead, this is Gemini 4. Standing by.
13 53 40 C Roger. 06:15, Command Pilot awake. Over.
13 53 54 P Roger. 06:15, Command Pilot awake.
13 53 57 CC Roger. 07:02 RKV tape playback. Medical Data

13 54 34 C Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Do you read? Over.
13 54 47 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
13 55 02 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
13 55 09 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. I'm not receiving
you. I'll broadcast the last two items of the Flight
Plan in the blind. Command Pilot eat 07:15 to 11:15.
Pilot sleeps 07:15 to 11:15. This is Houston CAP
COM broadcasting in the blind, Flight Plan 08:35
13 57 07 P I took S-5 picture just as I got contact with Houston
and I wasn't able co log it. It was of a cloud formation
at approximately 05:06. It was frame 44.
14 03 04 P Our power-down condition is down running just a tad
over 12 amps. Looks like a real good power-down.

14 12 42 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is RKV CAP COM.
14 12 57 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is RKV CAP COM.
14 13 05 P Go ahead RKV, Gemini 4.
14 13 08 CC Roger, how do you read?
14 13 10 P Read you loud and clear. About the best that we've
had for a while.
14 13 14 CC Roger. I have flight plan updates for you. How
much did you copy over the CSQ?
14 13 21 P Roger. 07:15 Command Pilot awakes. 07:02 RKV tape
dump. Medical Type 1 for Command Pilot 08:15. Command
Pilot eats 08 o'clock. We didn't get anymore.
14 13 36 CC Roger. 07:15 to 11:15 Pilot sleeps. 08:35 RKV will
update you with PLA's and CLA's and an RKV tape dump.
I have orbital navigation update information for you.
14 14 03 P Roger. Understand. 07:15 to 11:15 Pilot sleeps.
08:35 PLA and CLA update, and I am standing by for
the orbit update.
14 14 25 CC Roger. There will also be a tape dump at 08:35.
14 14 31 P Roger. I'd like to know the quality of the tape dump
we've been giving now. Be advised we have ... attitude
holding for you.
14 14 38 CC Roger. We have had two dumps here and they have been
extremely good ... site has reported the tape
dumps have been good.
14 14 48 P Roger. Understand ... request orbit update.
14 14 54 CC Roger. Ascending node longitude 3° West.
G.m.t. 05:53.
14 15 09 P Roger. Understand ascending node longitude 03° West
at 05:53 G.m.t.
14 15 16 CC That's affirmative. The Cape is also going to try
air-to-ground remoting over Ascension.
14 15 22 P Roger. We'll be standing by for ... at the present
time.
14 15 33 CC Roger, we gave you a T<sub>X</sub>.
14 15 35 P Roger.

	Page 106
14 15 52 P Will you relay to Houston than we have apparently a
burned-out bulb in aft window of the sextant, and
if they might have any further instructions for us.
Perhaps we have an extra bulb onboard ... battery
... the bulb.
14 16 17 P RKV, Gemini 4. Did you hear me?
14 16 21 CC Roger, Gemini 4.
14 16 23 P Roger.
14 16 37 P ... is staying comparatively low. We're setting
dew point spread of about 13 or 14°.
14 16 51 CC Say again, please, Gemini 4.
14 16 53 P We're getting dew point spread on the order of 65°
wet bulb and about 73° dry bulb. It looks good.
It looks pretty good from here so far.
14 17 06 CC Roger, real good.
14 17 08 P ... sleeping with face-plate closed.
14 17 23 CC Roger.
14 30 44 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Over.
14 30 54 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Over.
14 31 00 P ...
14 31 04 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. I can hear you transmitting
but you are unreadable. Over.
14 31 10 P Houston, Gemini 4. You're breaking up. You're
breaking up, Gemini 4.
14 31 15 CC Roger, Gemini 4. This is Houston CAP COM. I'm
reading you now very, very weak. There is no spare
bulb for your sextant. Suggest fingertip lighting
only. Over.
14 31 29 P Roger. You're coming through five-square ...
14 31 36 CC Roger. You're barely readable. We'd like to recommend
that you advise us as to your sleep periods,
whether or not you feel you're getting enough. And
we'll attempt to real time the flight plan around
your sleep period. Over.
14 31 55 P ... 25 minutes ... not wake him up at that time
if he's still sleeping soundly and let him go ahead
and sleep it out.

	Page 107
14 32 11 CC Ed, this is Houston CAP COM. I can't read you -
can't understand what you're talking about. Apparently
you can read me. We're concerned about your
O<sub>2</sub> source pressure. Did you say it was 973? 973?
14 32 34 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. We're concerned
about your O<sub>2</sub> source pressure getting to the limit.
Over.
14 32 43 P Roger. Be advised the O<sub>2</sub> is at ...
14 33 05 P Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4.
14 33 09 CC Go Gemini 4. Houston CAP COM.
14 33 11 P Roger. Be advised the O<sub>2</sub> is at about 970 at the
present time.
14 33 24 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM, Say again your last,
please. Say again.
14 33 30 P ... O<sub>2</sub> ...
14 33 45 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Understand your O<sub>2</sub> source
pressure is holding at 970. Is that affirm?
14 33 56 P ...
14 34 15 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. You are unreadable,
apparently you are reading us okay. I'll just be
standing by. Over.
14 34 36 P Jim's starting to come out on the day side on his
side again, and again I have quite good stars on my.
side. I have Arguella right out in front of me right
now. Looks like I'm reading - seeing magnitudes now
down to the fifth order, and Jim's got daylight on
his side.
14 40 47 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
14 40 51 P Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
14 40 54 CC Roger. We received negative C-band track over
Ascension. Can you tell us what your attitudes were,
please?
14 41 03 P Roger. Say again, please.
14 41 07 CC Roger. We received negative C-band track over
Ascension. We would like to know what your attitudes
were.

	Page 108
14 41 16 C Roger. Pitch at that time was - the small end was
pointing up at the stars primarily, and we were in
free drift. The blunt end ...
14 41 34 CC Roger. We got it. That explains the negative C-band
track.
14 41 38 C Roger.
14 41 42 P It'll go 360° around when it's pointing small-end-forward,
but when it's pointing up it's not too good,
I guess.
14 47 40 P Put a new tape cartridge at 06:00. I just took
another S-6 picture. It was over the desert area
showing the long longitudinal trim lines in the sand.
14 48 19 P Took a second picture as I crossed the east coast of
Africa.
14 48 22 P Looks like I am coming right - I might be able to see
the city of Mecca. It should be in my area. Might
cross over it. The Arabian Peninsula -
14 48 36 P ... goes by, I'll take another picture of the
Arabian Peninsula area.
14 48 50 P My attitudes on the last shot were about 90° down
and about 30 or 40° ...
14 50 19 P I took another picture of the Arabian Peninsula area.
Looks like it goes right up along a dry river bed.
The erosion is up where the water sometimes comes.
14 52 50 P I took another S-6 photo, no. 51.
14 55 41 P We're passing over the Himalayas, I believe. Very
close to the pictures that Gordo took on his orbital
flight. I believe Jim is looking out through his
window at it now.
15 23 59 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
15 24 11 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
15 24 26 C Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
15 24 29 CC Roger Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. I have an 11-BRAVO
update. Are you ready to copy?
15 24 37 C Stand by one, please.
15 24 41 CC Understand you're ready to copy 11-BRAVO. Over.
15 24 55 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM following with
11-BRAVO update.

	Page 109
15 25 03 CC 183. 3+57. 07 08 55. 09+30. Reverse bank angle
is not applicable. Over.
15 25 34 C Houston, Gemini 4.
15 25 40 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Did you copy 11-BRAVO
update?
15 25 56 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Did you copy
11-BRAVO update? Over
15 26 21 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Did you copy
11-BRAVO?
15 26 53 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. I'm not reading
you. I will read 11-BRAVO once more in the blind.
11-BRAVO: 183. 3+57. 07 08 55. 9+30. Reverse
bank angle not applicable.
15 27 26 C Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4 ...
15 27 36 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. You're still unreadable.
15 28 55 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. How do you
read me? Over.
15 47 30 S Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. Understand blood pressure.
Give me a mark on your exercise.
15 47 36 C Roger.
15 47 44 C MARK!
15 48 14 C Blood pressure is coming.
15 48 30 S Full scale.
15 49 14 S ... blood pressure standing by for your food, water
...
15 49 20 C Roger.
15 50 00 C I feel quite rested now, although I wasn't really
able to get any good sleep. I had two meals. I had
breakfast right after we got through with our EVA
exercise and while Ed was sleeping. Then I had
another meal, meal B. In the first meal I didn't
eat the bacon and egg bites. In the second meal I
think I've eaten all of it. After I woke up I had
10 swallows of water.
15 50 30 C Roger. I've had 10 swallows of water since I woke
up probably ... before I went to sleep.
15 50 45 S Roger. Any other comments?

	Page 110
15 50 49 C We managed to get the urine system, urine bags dumped,
and we're in pretty good shape ...
15 50 58 S Roger.
15 51 00 C Roger, be advised that so far we've had to avoid ...
any water floating around the cabin. I think that
we're doing pretty well where we are.
15 51 12 CC Roger. This is RKV CAP COM. I have an update for
photographic purposes on the eleventh revolution.
15 51 20 C Roger. Stand by one.
15 51 27 C Okay, go ahead with your update.
15 51 29 CC Roger. Typhoon Babe, G.m.t. 07:56, south of Hong
Kong. It will be north of the ground track.
15 51 49 C Roger, 07:56 we will see north of the ground track,
Typhoon Babe.
15 51 57 C Is that correct?
15 52 00 CC Roger. That's affirmative. This will be south of
Hong Kong.
15 52 05 C Roger. South of Hong Kong.
15 52 06 CC Roger, also have 11-BRAVO update for you.
15 52 11 C Stand by a minute.
15 52 17 C Okay, go ahead.
15 52 19 CC 11-BRAVO: 183. 3+57. 07 58 55. 09+30. GMTRB
N/A.
15 52 40 C Roger. Give us our delta-V again. We missed that.
15 52 43 CC Roger. 183.
15 52 50 C RKV, Gemini 4. Give us our delta-V again. Say it again.
15 53 00 CC 183.
15 53 05 C Okay, Gemini 4, reading back 11-BRAVO: 183. 3+57. 07 58 59. 
09+30.
15 53 15 CC Roger, roger, roger.
16 21 20 C ... over Africa I took one picture ... I think
that was exposure no. 53 in the Hasselblad magazine.
16 22 08 C Now we're over the Mediterranean. It is very easy
to recognize. I see a couple of very large ships.
They start off from Beirut. We should be passing
just south of Beirut.

	Page 111
16 30 06 C I just took a picture. Frame no. 14 on the Contarex
the same film pack we used for the EVA. There's the
start of a long area of clouds. It appears to be
cut-off between the desert area and the mountainous
area that extends over China.
16 39 28 P Now it's 07:55 and 1/2. I shot off the Contarex,
trying to get Hurricane Babe. It wasn't very successful.
The hurricane itself isn't very prevalent.
Looks like another group of clouds.
17 20 35 C Gemini 4. How do you read?
17 20 37 CC Roger, I read you loud and clear. How me?
17 20 40 C Loud and clear.
17 20 41 CC Roger, it's the clearest it's been.
17 20 45 C Yes. It's very nice talking to people I can understand.
It doesn't happen very often.
17 20 49 CC Roger.
17 20 50 CC I have a Flight Plan update for you, for ground
elapsed time of 19 hours going on to 22 hours.
17 21 00 C Roger. Go ahead.
17 21 01 CC Roger, on Rev 12 RKV will update your PLA and CLA
time; Rev 13 Canary Islands will have a C-band track.
And also there will be astro-orbital nav check-run.
No propellant usage for ATTITUDE control. This is
a g.e.t, of ... or a G.m.t. time of 12 hours
16 minutes 00 seconds. Rev 13 tape dump over
Carnarvon. After Carnarvon pass go to normal Flight
Plan except when changes are required. Did you copy?
17 22 02 C Roger, understand, at hours 18 to 22. On Rev 12 over
RKV I will be updated with my PLA and CLA. Rev 13
over Canary will have a C-band track. At a G.m.t. of 12 16 00,
I can do some orbit nav providing it
requires no fuel. On Rev 13 I will have a tape dump
over Carnarvon and I'll begin a normal Flight Plan
after that time. Is that correct?
17 22 35 CC Roger. That is correct. Everything still looks real
good to us on the ground.
17 22 41 C Roger, it looks pretty good up here, too.
17 22 44 CC Roger, it would.
17 22 45 C I think I've looked at the earth from every conceivable
angle over the last 6 or 8 hours.

	Page 112
17 22 50 CC Yes, I can imagine.
17 22 53 C Do you have some updates for us as far as PLA and
CLA at this time?
17 22 58 CC Negative. We won't get that until the next rev.
17 23 01 C Okay, fine.
17 23 03 C It is really good to talk to somebody that I can
understand and somebody that can hear me.
17 23 08 CC Roger, we are kind of in the same shape, here,
sitting out in this boat. We have a little trouble
getting communications with the rest of the world.
17 23 16 C Okay, we'll get around to talking to each other for
a minute because I can't talk to them either.
17 23 22 CC Roger.
17 23 27 CC How's the sleeping going up there, floating around?
17 23 31 C Actually it doesn't go too well because unfortunately
we don't have any way of shutting off the radio. So
that when we are talking like this, Ed can hear you
and I; although he has his volume down, I'm sure he
hears us right now. And it's awfully cramped. We
got all this extra equipment on board that we'd hoped
to dump out and it is really crowded.
17 23 51 CC Yeah, man!
17 23 55 CC It seems like it would be kind of soft sleeping, without
any weight or anything.
17 23 59 C It is, but you still are restricted to a certain position
just like sitting in a bus seat. Although
you don't sit on your fanny, you still have to sit
in the same shape.
17 24 10 CC Yes, I can imagine.
17 24 35 CC Gemini 4, Flight asks how are you doing as far as
getting things stowed away and if you are getting a
little crowded up there.
17 24 43 C Yes, indeed. We are crowded. We have most of that
junk down in our foot well, and I guess we are going
to have to hold some of it during reentry.
17 24 53 CC Oh boy! That sounds like a lot of fun.

	Page 113
17 25 00 C So far our major problem aside from the hatch and a
few other exciting moments is trying to figure out
what to do with all the stuff we've got.
17 25 09 CC Yes. Well, let's see, there's a lot of empty space
out there around you.
17 25 19 C Yes, and I sure wish I could get to it.
17 25 20 CC Yes, I imagine.
17 25 39 CC Flight advises that they have very good communications
on this air-to-ground remoting and would like
you to go over the problem you had with the hatch
closure.
17 25 48 C Roger. There are two gears that we have that go
around when you pull the handle back and forth. One
of them is the gear that sort of acts as a ratchet,
a little cylinder with a piston in it and a spike
behind it that engages the ratchet. And we were
having a little trouble with that before we got it
open and after we got it open we had difficulty
getting this ratchet to work. Also, we had a great
deal of difficulty getting the hatch closed far
enough so that we could even start latching it.
Then, Ed had to push the ratchet in with his hand
on every go until we got the thing started. And I
was pulling on the thing until I thought probably
I was going to break a lug right out of the hatch.
And we finally got it going, and it finally came
forward. So I don't think we ought to try opening
it up anymore.
17 26 43 CC Yes, Roger. Sounds like a good idea to keep it
closed.
17 26 47 C Rog. I'm not sure what the trouble was when we got
down close but I tell you one thing, I'm glad that
we spent so much time training in closing - opening
and closing hatches.
17 26 58 CC Yes, all that extra training sure pays off at times.
17 27 17 CC Roger, Gemini 4. We're coming up on LOS here shortly.
Anything else?
17 27 37 CC Gemini 4, RKV.
17 40 50 P I just took a picture on the Hasselblad, Frame 54.
A picture of cloud streaks over the South Atlantic
...

	Page 114
17 43 42 P Frame 55 on the Hasselblad just as we came on to
Africa. We had a very good high altitude cloud
streak, it looked like - so I took another picture
of the high altitude ones.
17 45 04 P Over Africa now. I just took Frame 56 on the
Hasselblad. It was a topographic feature. It looked
like it had been an old volcano at one time and you
could see the concentric circles on the top of where
it had erupted a number of times or the way it
eroded. 09:01.
17 48 20 P ... Film Pack no. 11 on the Hasselblad and no. 7
on the ...
18 00 21 C I just saw the booster in the sunlight, at a distance
I would estimate of 50 miles or so. Time is 09:16
and 1/2.
18 01 10 C I don't know which way I was pointing when I saw the
booster. Can't see the ground at the present time.
18 54 49 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
18 54 58 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
18 55 04 P RKV, Gemini 4. How do you read?
18 55 07 CC Roger, reading you fairly clear, a little background
noise. How me?
18 55 18 CC Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
18 55 21 C Roger RKV, you broke up. I only got the first part
and the last part of your message here.
18 55 25 CC Roger. I read you loud and clear now.
18 55 28 C Same here.
18 55 29 CC Roger, I've got a whole lot of things to pass up to
you.
18 55 33 C Okay, go ahead.
18 55 34 CC Roger, I've got a map update. It'll be G.m.t. 10 17 49.
Ascending mode 73° West. You copy?
18 55 52 C Roger. 10 17 49. 73° West.
18 55 57 CC Roger, I have a correction to the Flight Plan. You
will be tape dumped on the 13th Rev over Canary
Island and the tape dump for Carnarvon will be
changed to the 14th Rev.

	Page 115
18 56 11 C Okay, tape dump over Canary on the 13th and
Carnarvon on the 14th.
18 56 16 CC Roger, stand by for retro updates. Are you reading?
18 56 28 C Roger, go ahead.

18 59 45 C RKV, Gemini 4.
18 59 47 CC Roger, did you copy those?
18 59 49 C I got right down to 17-1 and then you started breaking
up. I got 17-1: 138, 3+48 ...
18 59 57 CC Roger, we're coming up on the LOS. That's all I'll
be able to give you.
19 00 04 C I can't read you, RKV.
19 00 05 CC Roger, we're coming up on LOS so that's it.
19 00 09 C Okay, give me a G.m.t. time hack if you can.
19 00 12 CC Roger, 10 16 20. 2, 1.

19 15 37 C Go ahead, Canary, Gemini 4.
19 15 38 CC Roger, give me your Read Switch on for 10 seconds.
19 16 01 C Read Switch coming off.
19 16 03 CC Roger.
19 16 12 CC Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM, I have more retrofire
data for you. Stand by to copy.
19 16 17 C Roger, standing by.

	Page 116
19 16 21 CC 17-BRAVO: 87, 01+51. 01 17 26 03. 10+03. 18-1: 04+14. 18 02 42. 02+44. 08+57. 18-BRAVO: 85. 01+48. 18 57 42. 09+19. 19-4: 137, 03+3 - correction, correction, 03+22. 20 50 11. 03+10,
19 17 41 CC 08+40. That's it. Do you have it?
19 17 53 C Roger, I had those, but I never did get 17-1 before.
Could you give me - I got 158. 3+48. And I never got
the GMTRC.
19 18 01 CC Roger. GMTRC 16 28 28. 02+39. 08+22.
19 18 17 C Roger, I have them. Thank you.
19 18 39 C Canary, what's my current orbit? Do you know?
19 18 43 CC Say again.
19 18 44 C What's my current apogee and perigee?
19 18 46 CC Stand by.
19 19 09 CC Apogee is 155.7 - Perigee is 88. They will give you
better data after they get our radar track.
19 19 19 C Okay.
19 51 29 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
19 51 37 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Over.
19 51 45 C Carnarvon, this is Gemini 4. How do you read?
19 51 47 CC Roger, read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
19 51 49 C Loud and clear.
19 51 50 CC Roger, will you turn your Quantity Read Switch ON,
please?
19 52 01 C Okay, we've got it.
19 52 14 CC Have you completed your M-3 exercise experiment?
19 52 20 C That's just a medical pass.
19 52 25 CC All right. I'd like to read out this Primary O<sub>2</sub>
pressure and quantity from you, please.
19 52 36 C Roger, primary - primary 02 pressure is 970 psi.
Quantity is about 39 1/2 percent.
19 52 46 CC Roger, I copied. Thank you.
19 53 18 CC Gemini 4, I've got some times for you. Ready to
copy? These are some changes to your Flight Plan.
19 53 26 C Okay, go ahead.

	Page 117
19 53 28 CC We would like you to switch your ADAPTER C-band
beacon switch to the CONTINUOUS position at 11 52 43.
19 53 44 C Roger, C-band ADAPTER SWITCH to CONTINUOUS at 11 52 43.
19 53 54 CC That's affirmative. We would like you to come back
to COMMAND at 11 59 23.
19 54 07 C Roger, back to COMMAND at 11 59 23.
19 54 11 CC Affirmative.
19 54 21 C I have a question, Carnarvon, it looks like we're
getting back on the fuel line and then we are going
to do the rest of the Flight Plan as originally
scheduled. Is that correct?
19 54 29 CC Roger, that's affirmative.
19 54 32 C Okay, my Flight Plan shows me going to sleep then at
the elapsed time of about 20:30 or so. Does that
still hold true?
19 54 42 CC That is affirmative.
19 54 43 C Okay.
19 54 59 C At the elapsed time of 22 hours we will take up the
Flight Plan again. We will be back on the fuel curve
at that time. Correct?
19 55 07 CC Affirmative.
19 55 08 C Okay.
20 25 56 P Oh, and I was also - can you hear me?
20 25 60 C Yes.
20 26 20 P Okay, I am switching the biomed recorders now from
no. 1 - OFF to no. 1 - ON and no. 2 - OFF. The
Command Pilot is going to sleep at this time. The
time is 11:43.
20 27 03 P Is the sextant back in the box?
20 27 05 C What?
20 27 08 P Where is the sextant?
20 27 10 C Where is the what?
20 27 12 P Sextant.
20 27 14 C It's right down here. Do you want it?
20 27 15 P Yes. Did we ever make the light work?

	Page 118
20 27 20 C No.
21 23 24 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
21 23 31 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Over.
21 23 35 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon. If you read, will the Pilot
please put the oral thermometer in his mouth.
21 23 53 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon.
21 23 57 P Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
21 23 59 S Roger. Will the pilot please put the oral thermometer
in his mouth?
21 24 03 P Roger. Affirmative. I have the oral thermometer in
the mouth. Do you want me to keep it closed for a
few minutes so you can get a temperature?
21 24 23 CC Okay. You can start pumping up the Pilot's blood
pressure, and leave the thermometer in your mouth.
Don't acknowledge.
21 25 34 CC Cuff's full-scale. Okay Gemini 4, we have enough
oral temp. Stand by for the Aero-Med.
21 25 50 S This is Carnarvon Surgeon. Your blood pressure is
coming ...
21 26 56 P Gemini 4. Be advised the exerciser is over on the
Command Pilot's side right now. I believe he's in
a pretty good sleep. I'd prefer not to disturb
him. Could I swap you this off and give you one
when he wakes up?
21 27 13 S This is the Surgeon. Say again. Is this the Pilot
speaking?
21 27 17 P Roger. That's affirmative ... The exerciser is
over on the Command Pilot's side and he's asleep,
I believe ...
21 27 26 S Understand. Disregard the exercise at this time.
Would you tell me what you've had to eat, sleep,
and drink.
21 27 36 P Say again, please.
21 27 38 S How about an eat, water, and sleep report, please?
21 27 41 P I had a very deep sleep and I woke up when the ...
changed from two to one and then I switched it back
to two and I went back to sleep again for at least
2 and 1/2 hours. I did not ... Jim had to actually
blow reveille for me to get up.

	Page 119
21 28 10 S You say you woke up an hour ago. What time did you
go to sleep, please?
21 28 20 P I was asleep 1 hour and I woke up at 11:30.
21 28 25 S Was that 4 hours sleep at 11:30?
21 28 30 P That's affirmative ... that was 11:30 and I'd
been asleep for approximately 4 hours.
21 28 40 S Have you had anything to eat?
21 28 41 P No, I haven't eaten since I went to bed - just before
I went on to sleep. I have had about 6 swallows of
water since I got up and I drank ...
21 28 57 S You haven't eaten Meal D? Meal D?
21 28 59 P That's affirmative, I haven't eaten that yet.
21 29 01 S Okay, fine. That's all I have. Thank you.
21 29 02 P Roger ...
21 29 05 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
21 29 07 P Go ahead, Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
21 29 08 CC Okay, do you have your gloves off?
21 29 10 P That's affirmative. I've had my gloves off since
... I took my sleeves off after the first 4-hour
sleep period that I had.
21 29 18 CC Roger, understand. I've got your Apollo Landmark
Run One. Ready to copy?
21 29 23 P Stand by one, please.
21 29 41 P Go ahead, ready to copy.
21 29 43 CC Roger, Apollo Run One: 13 54 08, northeast of track,
92 miles, and ... constraint on attitude control.
21 30 08 CC Roger, does the Command Pilot have his gloves off,
also?
21 30 16 CC Are the Command Pilot's gloves off?
21 30 18 P Neg - he put them on to go back to sleep.
21 30 21 CC Roger. Your Biomed no. 2 recorder should be on and
your no. 1 OFF at this time.
21 30 26 P Negative, we got a switch on that Pressure Regulator
... switch ... break switch has ... so that
no. 1 ... and this is what the configuration is
now, no. 1 is ON and no. 2 is OFF.

	Page 120
21 30 38 CC Roger.
21 30 40 P You might check that for us but that seems to be a
rather late change and that's the configuration that
we've been running in.
21 30 46 CC All right. I'll check.
21 31 09 CC We want your recorders in the position you are in
right now.
21 31 12 P Roger, understand. We're in the configuration with
no. 1 ON and no. 2 OFF.
21 31 15 CC That's affirmative. Very good.
21 31 17 P Roger.
22 08 20 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
22 08 55 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
22 09 44 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
22 09 56 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
22 10 00 P Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
22 10 06 CC Roger, Ed. I got a little information to pass along
to you here - are you reading okay?
22 10 17 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
22 10 20 P Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4 is reading you five
square.
22 10 24 CC Roger, Ed. We want you to resume your normal Flight
Plan. We base this on the fact that we feel that
you have 205 ft/sec delta-V left and 63 revolutions you'll
still be in a 81, 125.7 orbit. That will leave us
enough for OAMS retro which we think will be
113 ft/sec at that time - are you getting this?
22 11 05 P Roger. Understand we expect at the 63 rev to be
81, 125. We'll be required 113 OAMS approximately
that time and we're prepared to go into our normal
Flight Plan.
22 11 17 CC Roger. Your orbit isn't decaying as fast as we had
expected, has a decay factor of approximately 0.8.
So we are very happy with your orbit and we don't
feel you're going to need an orbit adjust.
22 11 32 P That's right, it sounds good. That's this streamlined
Gemini capsule.

	Page 121
22 11 37 CC Also, this is based on the amount of fuel used up in
your first orbit. We're using that as a basis.
22 11 44 P Roger.
22 11 46 CC Go ahead and try your Apollo Landmark Identification,
but remember, the thing is 92 miles away so don't use
very much fuel looking for it. I recommend that you
reduce your use of fuel from now on.
22 12 06 CC Okay.
22 12 08 P You're starting to get broken up, Houston ...
Houston do you read Gemini 4?
22 12 15 CC Roger, read you.
22 12 18 CC You're starting breakup; you seem to have a loud
background noise.
22 12 23 CC Roger, I'll get these for you when we pick up Bermuda,
then.
22 12 27 P Roger.
22 12 49 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
22 12 58 CC Gemini 4, Houston.
22 13 09 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
22 13 13 P Go ahead, Houston, Gemini 4.
22 13 16 CC Roger. What is the condition of your fan there?
Are you on one fan or two fans?
22 13 23 P We are on one fan, we have been on one fan for the
last 2 hours.
22 13 28 CC Roger, how's your comfort?
22 13 30 P It's not bad. It gets a little warm in here. It
seems to get warm when I go to sleep. I don't know
why. It should get cold then, but seems to warm up
then and we put them on for about 3 hours, two fans
while I was asleep.
22 13 43 CC Roger.
22 13 45 P It seems to get a little warmer in this bunny suit.
22 13 47 CC Yes, I'm not surprised.
22 13 49 P Roger.

	Page 122
22 13 52 CC Okay, the last thing I tried to get to you before I
lost you a few seconds ago was the judicious use of
fuel. They think you have enough to complete the
whole Flight Plan now.
22 14 05 P Understand. Why don't you give us a call on these
landmark sightings?
22 14 09 CC Roger, don't worry about that one in Africa because
that is some 19 miles away and you are only 114 miles
high at this time.
22 14 19 P Roger, we will be looking for it. That's a real
good one; we'll look for it but we won't use as much
fuel. Looks like Jim's corked off pretty well. He
hasn't stirred the last hour and a half.
22 14 31 CC Okay, I had a news release for him here, about Mike's
baseball team. You want to take it and pass it on to
him?
22 14 36 P Rog, pass it up.
22 14 38 CC Okay, the Hawks won their Peewee League 3-2. They
beat the Falcons. The Hawks got 3 runs on 2 hits,
the Falcons got 2 runs on 3 hits.
22 14 50 P Roger, understand, Hawks won 3-2.
22 14 56 CC Roger. Hey, here's the headline of the Post today;
you might pass along also, sounds pretty good. The
big headlines are "Aw, Ed, Please Get Back In the
Spaceship."
22 15 10 P What was that? Say it again.
22 15 14 CC The headlines are: "Aw, Ed, Please Get Back In the
Spaceship."
22 15 18 P I'll give them to him when he gets up.
22 15 21 CC Say again.
22 15 23 P Come in, Gus, I'll tell you. It was a little tough
to get in.
22 15 29 CC I can't read you now, say again.
22 15 31 P It was tough to come in and it was a little tough
to get back in, too. But it sure was something out
there!
22 15 37 CC Yes, I bet! I envy you.
22 15 41 P Roger, it was really great. Were ya'll reading us?
We never knew when you were reading us or not.

	Page 123
22 15 48 CC Yes, your VOX was keyed all the time and we couldn't
get in or try to tell you that your time was up and
to get back in. We could never get through to you
at all.
22 15 55 P Oh, is that right? I'm glad you didn't.
22 15 58 CC I could tell that.
22 16 02 P It was difficult to take pictures out there with
that rig, ... was fine. We tried to get some
pictures there ... but we never did get with my
still camera pictures to my satisfaction.
22 16 15 CC Say.
22 16 19 P Reel on the outdoor 16-mm. We should be getting
something with that.
22 16 21 CC Yes, I hope you get some good ones. Could you give
us Quantity Read for about 10 seconds?
22 16 24 P Quantity is coming for 10 seconds.
22 16 30 CC Have you had anything to eat yet?
22 16 32 P I am in the middle of my first course of soup and
I'm expected to get a little chicken salad and finish
off with a fruit salad and orange juice.
22 16 46 CC Okay, we got your quantity, so we we'll leave you
alone and let you eat.
22 16 50 P Say again.
22 16 52 CC I said you can turn your Quantity Read OFF and we
will leave you alone and let you eat.
22 16 56 P Well, it was nice to talk to you and get all the
news from the home front. As we went over Houston,
I could actually see. When I was outside, I could
see the Gulf and Galveston Bay and I could see right
on up into Clear Lake.
22 17 10 CC Could you see the Domed Stadium?
22 17 13 P I was looking for it but I couldn't pick it out. I
didn't see it. Say, if I could have spent time
looking down I could have seen a lot. I can see a
heck of a lot more from outside the spacecraft than
inside. Things are very much clearer.
22 17 27 CC Yes, I bet.

	Page 124
22 17 30 P Really, one of the prettiest sights I saw was when
I looked down and saw the southern tip of Florida
and the island of Cuba and Puerto Rico and Santa
Domingo. It was really quite a view. The colors
of the blue and the blues as the water deepened out
there, with the island was quite a view.
22 17 59 CC Hey, Ed, when you came over on the night pass could
you actually see the buildings?
22 18 06 P On the night pass?
22 18 08 CC Yes, you said at night view you could see ...
22 18 10 P No, I couldn't. You might have misunderstood me.
I couldn't see any buildings. And you might relay
to the Australians that they're sure running up the
electricity bill. I could see as we came over on
this last pass. I could see the lights of Sydney
loud and clear and the usual thunderstorms up north.
22 18 30 CC Very good. Hey, Ed, you were talking about walking
on the spacecraft. Were you actually walking on it?
22 18 44 P Yes, I was. I was using the tether to pull myself
down toward the spacecraft and I was right on top
of it, as a matter of fact. The next time I get
into this type of tether operation - it looks pretty
good but it still is hard to get any traction on the
top, but if you pull yourself down you can get a
little bit.
22 19 09 CC You forgot your magnets, I guess.
22 19 12 P Yes. It looks like it will be pretty good on the
adapter, too, so that might help a lot.
22 19 20 CC Yes.
22 19 22 P ...
22 19 26 CC We are losing you.

	Section CANARY

22 26 35 CC Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
22 26 39 P Go ahead, Canary, Gemini 4.
22 26 41 CC Roger, just wanted to let you know all your systems
look green.

	Page 125
22 26 45 P Roger. They look good from up here also. The O<sub>2</sub>
is staying down around 940, 947.
22 28 37 CC Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. LOS-1. Do you have anything
for us?
22 28 51 CC Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
22 28 53 P Roger, Canary. Gemini 4.
22 28 54 CC We're coming up on LOS. Do you have anything else
for us?
22 28 57 P Negative, you just caught me with a mouthful.
22 28 59 CC I'm sorry.
22 29 01 P No sweat. I'm just kidding you. Everything's fine
up here.

	Section CARNARVON

22 57 51 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
22 58 00 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM, over.
22 58 06 P Go ahead Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
22 58 08 CC We'll let you know when we're done here. We're
reading you loud and clear and you look real good
from here on the ground.
22 58 15 P Roger, everything's going smooth up here. We delay
a little bit when we answer you because we turned
our UHF transmitter on at that time and we need a
little time to warm up.
22 58 25 CC Roger, ... the rest of the flight.
22 58 27 P Roger, we are down at a minimum power-down configuration
most of the time now, and whenever you call
us, there's usually a little bit of a delay between
our answer.
22 58 37 CC Roger, understand. If you have anything else, we'll
be down here waiting.
22 58 42 P You might ask ... if they can work up some settings
for inside-the-spacecraft pictures; we have 200 feet
of film. I have taken a few in here already, but I
thought they might give us a suggested light meter
reading.

	Page 126
22 59 01 CC Roger. We'll see if we can get it for you.
22 59 02 P Also get a movie camera 16-mm setting for inside
the spacecraft. We have a large but eye, and we
thought that we'd take some pictures with in inside
if we had a little film left over.
22 59 17 CC Roger.
22 59 37 P Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
22 59 40 CC Gemini 4, go ahead.
22 59 41 P Roger, you might relay that we saw the lights of
Sydney. I don't know whether they turned them on
or not, but if they did they sure ran up the electrical
bill. I saw them on the last orbit. We
went right over the town of Sydney and they were
really loud and clear.
22 59 56 CC Okay, the people appreciate that.
22 59 58 P ... big electrical bill ...
23 00 03 CC ...
23 00 05 P Okay.
23 45 36 CC Gemini 4, CAP COM.
23 45 39 P Go ahead, CAP COM, This is Gemini 4.
23 45 47 CC I'd like to give you your map update.
23 45 50 P Roger. Go ahead.
23 45 51 CC Okay, Revolution 16, use 161 West, at a G.m.t. of 16 14 30.
23 46 03 P Roger. Understand 161° West and 16 14 30.
23 46 09 CC Roger, and we'd like to know what was the status of
the experiments MSC-1, -2, and -3. Recall?
23 46 18 P Roger, we have been doing them as per Flight Plan.
We left MSC-2 and -3 on after our thrusting a little
longer than planned. We turned it off at about 4:20,
if I recall right. We were planning to turn it off
around 3:00.
23 46 35 CC Roger.
23 46 39 P ...
23 46 42 CC Roger.
23 46 47 CC Jim still asleep?

	Page 127
23 46 48 P Say again, please.
23 46 51 CC Is Jim still asleep?
23 46 54 P Roger. He's still asleep.
23 46 58 CC What's the housekeeping like in there? Have you
got junk all over?
23 47 01 P No, it's not too bad. We've got the bulk of all
the extra stuff stored underneath our legs behind
our heels, it's stuff you don't use very much anyhow
so it's not much of a discomfort. But we've
got the cameras and bags and refuse bags pretty
well stuck all around on the Velcro.
23 47 20 CC Okay. Have you tried getting any of that stuff
back into the AFT food boxes?
23 47 25 P No, the refuse will be - we're planning to have a
big dump back there into the right food box.
23 47 33 CC Roger.
23 47 35 P Actually, it's not too bad.
23 47 37 CC Okay.
23 47 45 CC Tried to put that cable back, Ed?
23 47 50 CC Gemini 4, CAP COM.
23 47 53 P Go ahead, CAP COM. Gemini 4.
23 47 55 CC Have you actually tried to put that cable back in
the AFT food box?
23 48 02 P Negative. I haven't planned to put it back there.
I have no plans for it.
23 48 15 CC Roger. I understand you haven't tried but you have
a place for it. Is that right?
23 48 20 P That's affirmative.
23 48 21 CC Okay.
23 48 23 CC Where do you have it?
23 48 25 P I'm going to hold it in my lap during reentry.
23 48 30 CC In your lap?
23 48 31 P Roger.
23 48 35 P When you stow it in the back box there, it will take
up just about the whole box and we would have to put
garbage all over the place.

	Page 128
23 48 43 CC Okay.
23 49 01 CC After sleeping it over, do you feel any different
about opening the hatch?
23 49 09 P No, we're very definite about not doing that.
23 49 11 CC You think you can live with all that stuff in there?
23 49 15 P That's affirmative.
23 49 16 CC Okay.
23 49 55 CC Ed.
23 50 00 CC Gemini 4, CAP COM.
23 50 01 P Go ahead CAP COM, Gemini 4.
23 50 02 CC Have you had any waste management problems?
23 50 05 P Negative. We've dumped some bags. We've had a

23 5012 CC Roger.
23 50 16 P We haven't tried the bag yet.
23 50 19 CC Roger, understand.
23 50 52 CC Gemini 4.
23 50 54 P Roger, go ahead CAP COM.
23 50 56 CC Do I understand - you have ... You have the umbilical
under your feet now and you're going to
hold it in your lap for reentry. Is that correct?
23 51 03 P That's affirmative. We figured that's the best way
as far as the ejection envelope is concerned.
23 51 08 CC Okay, but you feel it's pretty well out of your way
under your feet now?
23 51 11 P Yes it is. It's fine. It's under my feet, ...
under there also.
23 51 17 CC Well, can you stretch it out, get comfortable or do
you feel pretty cramped?
23 51 22 P No, that's no sweat. I'm - I can stretch out.
23 51 25 CC Okay, good.
23 51 27 P I've also taken my sleeves off and Jim's got those
under his feet.
23 51 42 CC Roger.
23 51 45 CC We're very happy down here.

	Page 129
23 51 47 P Roger, it's very nice up here, Gus. Everything's
running right along.
23 51 57 CC Have you noticed any moisture problems?
23 51 59 P No. As a matter of fact, I've been running faceplate
open for quite a while just to take a look
around and see if we are picking up any. In fact,
the relative humidity has dropped a little bit in
here and we have no apparent moisture anywhere in
the spacecraft.

23 57 30 P Roger, Canary. Gemini. We're back on our regular
Flight Plan, but at this time our Flight Plan goes
in with not much detail as far as specific times.
Would you relay to Houston that we'd like to have
our Flight Plan updated with good, specific times
as we go along to aid us in getting started on our

24 32 48 P Roger, I'm powered down - all the lights - looks
like I'm pulling about 13 to 14 amps and everything
is down. The lights are down, I'm observing the
stars right now, and the Command Pilot is still
asleep.
24 33 05 CC Okay, what did you say about the lights?
24 33 07 P I have the lights all the way down and everything
is normal in the spacecraft.
24 33 11 CC Roger, understand.
24 33 18 CC They don't have much of a change right now in the
Flight Plan. They'll update you over the States.
24 33 21 P All right, that sounds fine. I guess they got the
message to keep the event times updated?

your update.
24 33 47 CC Roger. I gave you a T<sub>X</sub>.
24 33 49 P Roger.

happen to have that oral probe in his mouth, does
he, for a temperature?

25 23 36 CC On the what?
25 23 37 P ... you read out the angle in.
25 23 42 CC Roger.
25 23 58 CC Hey, Jim. Did you sleep well?
25 24 02 C Not particularly. I just rest, and I've been dozing
on and off, but I really haven't had a sound sleep
this last time.
25 24 10 CC Does the radio awake you?
25 24 14 C Yes, as a matter of fact, it does. We ought to be
able to turn it off completely.
25 24 18 CC Roger. Have you tried your fingertip lights in
that sextant? Will that help?
25 24 26 C No. We can find some other light. It just means
that the operation is going to be slowed down, and
I'm sure we can really do it as it was designed.
25 24 35 CC Okay.
25 25 06 CC Jim?

25 25 10 CC Have you had anything to eat or drink since you've

soon as I woke up I had about 5 swallows of water,
and I woke up in the middle of my nap and took about
5 swallows, also.
25 25 24 CC Okay. The sawbones advises you ought to go ahead

which way I'm pointing, but there's a bunch of rays,
all extending up from the earth toward the sky. It
looks like it's probably the sunrise. The rays are
actually sticking up vertically and I'm taking two
pictures of them with the Contarex. It looks a lot
like the Northern Lights ...

26 09 35 S Gemini 4, this is the Surgeon. Can you give me some
information on your food and water consumption?
26 09 37 C Roger. This is Command Pilot. I woke up about
30 minutes ago. Then I had lunch.
26 09 46 S Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is the Surgeon. Do you
read? Over.
26 09 52 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Give me a readout on
your food and water consumption ...
26 09 56 C Roger, this is Gemini 4. How do you read?
26 09 58 CC Loud and clear. How me?
26 10 00 C Loud and clear. I woke up about 30 or 40 minutes
ago and then - actually I didn't wake up right
then - just sort of sitting there resting. I really
haven't been having much luck sleeping. I had a
drink of water when I first woke up, about 5 gulps.
Then I had another one there about halfway through
my sleeping period, about 5 gulps. I plan on eating
something as soon as I get through with my HF tests.
26 10 24 CC Roger, understand.
26 10 28 C So far I've been through three meals. I'm going to
eat meal 4 on the first day.
26 10 34 CC Roger. Understand.

	Page 139
26 10 36 C Doctor, be advised, I'm having a lot of trouble with
this blood pressure cuff. I can't get it to stay
in my suit and when I do get it in it doesn't want
to bleed down. So if you see some erratic pump-ups,
it's because I'm not having much luck with it.
26 10 50 CC Okay.
26 11 00 S Gemini 4, this is the Surgeon.
26 11 03 C Go ahead, Surgeon.
26 11 05 S Could you repeat again what you ate out of meal 3
or meal C? Meal Charlie.
26 11 11 C Roger. I ate everything out of it except the orange
juice and I lost that some place. I don't know
where it went.
26 11 16 S Okay. Is that all you have had to eat since you ate
meal Baker?
26 11 20 C Roger. Oh yes, that's right, I didn't eat the toast
either. That toast is the crumbly toast that we
agreed not to eat.
26 11 28 S Okay. So you ate the other items. Thank you.
26 11 32 S Can you explain a little about this blood pressure
problem? Are you sure you didn't have your thumb
over the holes where the air comes out?
26 11 38 C I have had the same problem ever since lift-off. I
can't get the darn thing to stay in my suit. It
keeps popping out of my suit, and then I have quite
a difficult time getting it to bleed down sometimes:
26 11 49 S We got a valid blood pressure but the temperature
seems - the pressure seemed to hold up for quite a
while before it began to bleed off.
26 11 55 C That's right. Most of the time it seems to bleed
out around where I plug it in rather than through
the hole it's supposed to bleed from.
26 12 02 S Okay, this is the Surgeon out.
26 12 04 C Roger.
26 12 05 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. I updated your TR,
they did not get a valid time in at the Cape. You
now have a valid time for the 21-4. Same GMTRC relayed
to you by Houston CAP COM.
26 12 18 C Okay. I've got a good load for the 21-4. Right?

	Page 140
26 12 20 CC A good load and a good time.
26 12 23 C Okay. I've got a good spacecraft so I probably
won't need it.
26 12 26 CC That's the way we want to go.
26 13 04 CC Okay. Be advised the load in your computer is
18-1, with maneuver load. Your TR time is a 21-4
with maneuver time.
26 13 10 C Okay, we got a 18-1 load and a 21-4 time. Right?

starting at 17:31 and had no returns from any
stations on the range. Do you know whether any of
the stations are reading us?
26 37 16 CC Roger. We monitored you real weak on HF just now.
26 37 24 P Roger. I understand. You didn't read us when we
made our test then obviously because you gave us no
response.
26 37 31 CC Roger. We were copying till you gave your test.
We did not copy then.
26 37 36 C Roger. I understand you did not copy us while we
gave our test.

other time.
26 44 27 C Roger. He had a good night.
26 44 29 CC Yes. Okay, then. There were five air crewmen killed
at Walker Air Force Base last night when a KC-135
crashed on landing. Most of the rest of the news is
concerned with the flight, and you know pretty well
what's going on there so I won't repeat that to you.

26 44 54 C I think we know what's going on.

26 46 09 C Roger. You're loud and clear now, Houston.
26 46 13 CC Okay. We've got your wives here, so we'll put
Mrs. McDivitt on now.

26 46 21 CC Jim? Jim?
26 46 25 C What?
26 46 29 CC Do you hear me?
26 46 31 C Roger. I can hear you loud and clear.
26 46 34 CC Boy, you're doing great!
26 46 36 C Yes, we seem to be covering a lot of territory up
here. How are you?
26 46 42 CC For me?
26 46 45 C I say, how are you?
26 46 46 CC I'm fine, and how are you?
26 46 48 C Pretty good. I'm over California right now.
26 46 52 CC Get yourself over Texas.
26 46 55 C I'll be over Texas in about 3 minutes.
26 46 57 CC Hurry it up.
26 47 00 C How are the kids making out?
26 47 01 CC Fine. They think you're at the Cape.
26 47 05 C They think I'm at Cocoa Beach, huh?
26 47 08 CC That's where they think.
26 47 13 C Is everything going okay?
26 47 14 CC Yes, beautifully. Beautifully.
26 47 20 C Are you behaving yourself?

	Page 143
26 47 23 CC I'm always good. Are you being good?
26 47 29 C I don't have much choice. All I can do is eat,
sleep, and look out the window.
26 47 34 CC No room to move around?
26 47 36 C What?
26 47 38 CC No room to move around?
26 47 39 C Not too much.
26 47 40 C Ed's cluttering up the place.

26 48 22 CC We're going to switch headsets.
26 48 28 C Sounds like you've got your hands full, Gus.
26 48 31 CC Say again.
26 48 33 P Are you on top of the situation? Keeping things
straight?
26 48 37 CC Is this Ed?
26 48 42 CC We'll put your pad on here in a second.
26 48 44 CC Good morning.
26 48 48 P You've got to push the button, honey.
26 48 51 CC Good morning.
26 48 53 P How are you doing?
26 48 54 CC Fine!
26 48 57 P You have to push the button when you talk and let
it go so I can talk.
26 49 03 CC You're really looking good.

	Page 144
26 49 06 P Roger. It's looking pretty good from up here.
We're passing over - coming up on the West Texas
area. We'll be over Houston in a minute or so.
26 49 13 CC Good.
26 49 15 P ...

26 49 25 P Patty, repeat it.
26 49 27 CC It looks like you were having a wonderful time
yesterday.
26 49 32 P Quite a time we had. It was quite a time.
26 49 35 CC I can't wait to talk to you about it.
26 49 39 P How are Eddie and Bonnie, honey?
26 49 41 CC Fine.
26 49 48 P Okay, honey. I'll see you later.

to you?
26 53 07 C Roger. I had it pretty well figured out, I think,
before you called up. I've been plotting it on the
board up here, and it looks like if we get to the
end with about 135 or so, we ought to make the grade.
Is that it?
26 53 18 CC Yes. That's about the way we have it here. Just be
careful on your use of it, and we may cut a few
things out of the Flight Plan, but most of them you
can go ahead and do as planned.
26 53 28 C Okay.
26 53 34 CC Will you be ready for your HF check in about 3 minutes
or so?
26 53 38 C Roger. We're all set.

28 21 31 S We have received the good blood pressure. We're
standing by for your food report. Have you eaten
since your Carnarvon Aero-Med Pass?
28 21 38 C Negative, this is the Command Pilot. I just got
the chow out, and I'm just about to set to it.

28 21 45 C Negative, I have not eaten since my Carnarvon Aero-Med

28 24 09 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

	Page 150
28 30 31 CC Gemini 4, how do you read Houston CAP COM now?
*  C ... make it work.
28 35 50 P It seems like on the last roll, that the red light
didn't come on at the end of the roll. We were
running at the end of the roll when I noticed it,
so we might have lost the tape dump between the
last tape, 8, and the present tape, 6.
28 38 36 P The O<sub>2</sub> pressure gage is unsatisfactory in many respects.
Not only does it not have enough scale,
but, in our case now the ... is set down low
enough so that it is setting in the normal operating
range. We're causing it to go to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate all
the time to bring it down.
28 38 55 C Actually it's not the gage itself. It's the fact
that the vent pressure is set lower ...
28 39 00 P That's right ... bottles.
28 39 04 P ... vent ground -
28 39 05 C It vents low in our cabin also. The cabin holds
about 4.8 or 9 - normal.
28 39 33 C And the cabin vents at about 5.3.
28 39 48 P I can see them working on McDonnell now on this
gain. I imagine there's fur flying. It's going to
be when we get back. I'm going to hit them hard on
it. I want to know just when they cleaned that.
Remember? They were instructed to do it the day
before the flight.
28 40 12 C The trouble is, it wasn't only that, but just getting
your whole hatch closed, it never ever took that
kind of pulling on it before. That rubber must have
gotten real hard or something.
28 40 19 P Oh! You know one thing - see, I was giving you no
help here at all.
28 40 26 C You never needed to give me any help - before.
28 40 28 P All I was doing was working this, and with the
handle - I was fooling with the handle.
28 40 31 C Yes, but you have never given any help before though,
really.

	Page 151
28 40 33 P In fact, you were saying, "Don't break the handle
off!" Remember that?
28 40 37 C Was I?
28 40 38 P Yes.
28 40 40 C On this one?
28 40 43 P No, this one. You were telling me not to break that
handle off?
28 40 48 C I don't remember that, but sounds like good advice.
28 40 50 P I was sitting in there. Heave! Heave! Ha! Ha! Ha!
You remember that?
28 40 57 C I remember the "heave" part. Too bad that wasn't
all on tape.
28 41 02 P If it is, it'd be tremendous, wouldn't it?
28 41 03 C Yes.
28 41 04 P That's what it took? it took both of us together
to get it down.
28 41 12 P Well, I was down low enough, so that the hatch had
come all the way down and stopped.
28 41 16 C I thought it actually stopped on your ...
28 41 21 P On the head?
28 41 24 C On your helmet.
28 41 26 P I don't think ...
28 41 28 C I pulled and you'd go down lower. Every time I'd
pull, you would come down lower.
28 41 31 P I was doing this; every time I came down lower, my
legs went "boink."
28 41 33 C Oh, yes.
28 41 35 P There at the end, though, they were all right.
28 41 43 C Not like in that zero-g airplane, is it? ...
"Aw hell. Well, pull the hatch."
28 41 48 P Yes.
28 41 50 P Well, we'll try another parabola.
28 41 57 P I think Tom better take a close look at it, too -
with that chest pack.
28 42 02 C He's a lot bigger than you are.

	Page 152
28 42 04 P He's a lot less agile.
28 42 07 C I wonder if we ought to ...
28 42 14 P Yes, I know. You know how it is with that - that
chest pack in there is tough in the zero-g airplane.
28 42 24 C Yes. Well, you tend to always overrate our own
abilities, too.
28 42 28 P Yes.
28 42 38 P Now I can see the stars.
28 42 48 P No, but it's broad daylight over there, isn't it?
Are we starting to go in?
28 42 52 C Broad daylight over here.
28 43 00 C We better vent one more time. That ought to get ...
28 43 07 P I hate to see us using up our oxygen that way.
28 43 09 C Yes. Well, we're going to use it up anyway. We
don't ...
28 43 16 P Want me to get it?
28 43 52 P I'm going to start eating.
28 44 07 C I don't know what happened. I got a head start,
and you get the first meal.
28 44 14 P It's the same meal.
28 44 16 C The first one ...
28 44 26 P Actually, we are behind.
28 44 28 C Yes, we are ... 4 hours ...
28 44 38 P ... try to eat.
28 44 43 C If you eat more, Ed, you wouldn't be able to do
anything else. Isn't that the truth?
28 44 52 P We are not permitted to do a whole heck of a lot.
Actually though, our Flight Plan is fairly leisurely.
We're not really ...
28 45 07 C ... S-5 ... Hello, Houston. This is Gemini 4.
28 45 18 C You're broken up a little bit, but I can read you.
Be advised we vented our ECS pressure down to about
910, 920.
28 45 40 P ...
28 45 52 C We really ought to be keeping better track where we
are and where our retrofire points are.

	Page 153
28 46 03 P Yes.
28 46 09 P I don't know, there is not anything very difficult
about it, though. There are just the times.
28 46 48 C Did I hear somebody call Gemini 4?
28 47 07 P Where is the Contarex? See it lately?
28 47 14 C It used to be over here. I don't know where it is
now.
28 47 19 P I see it.

28 47 26 C Yes.
28 47 31 P Let me put this over here for a minute, Jim.
28 47 33 C Yes, why don't we just put it there?
28 47 36 P I've got to lean forward a minute to get to this
umbilical.
28 47 48 P Here's your Contarex.
28 47 52 P Oh. The settings for the Contarex in the cabin -
I wrote down and I'll get them and show you where
they are.
28 48 53 P Okay. The 16-mm is f/11, if it's right in front of
you, and f/28 if it's otherwise. The 35 is - with
the ASA 200, which we have two rolls of - is 1/250
f/11 and ...
28 50 24 C Okay. Which Biomed recorder is on now?
28 50 26 P Right now mine is on.
28 50 28 C And yours is off.
28 50 30 P Mine is on. I turned yours off as you got up.

28 51 48 P You know this is a lot of trouble, but still you
end up getting a lot of moisture and stuff with it,
too.
28 51 55 C ...
28 52 07 P I highly recommend it on the long flight.
28 52 12 C Something to do.
28 52 14 P Yes, and I don't know what in the world, - where
they can fit all this stuff.
28 52 42 C What do you want to do? Just ... on your and
... drink?
28 52 45 P Yes ...
28 53 21 P This isn't recommended with ... gloves on, at all.
28 53 28 C Are you going to sleep a little while, or are you
going to ... ?
28 53 31 P Yes, I think I will sleep. Go ahead and move around
a little bit if you want to.
28 53 40 P I tell you, I like it better in here with the visor
open.
28 53 48 C You know what?
28 53 50 P What?
28 53 51 C I think that I'll take a little more of that ...
28 53 52 P Eye stuff?
28 54 00 C Yes, with my helmet visor closed ...
28 54 02 P ...
28 54 45 P You know, maybe that's why we sleep decently for
a while and then - CRUSH!
28 54 55 P Let's see what I can rig up with my faceplate open.
28 55 04 C ... water.
28 55 11 P I wonder. Our relative, humidity is fine, Jim.
28 55 19 P We've been ... around with our faceplates open
a lot.
28 55 31 P Actually, this relative humidity gage is kind of
nice. It allows you to keep a tab on what's going
on.

	Page 155
28 55 59 P Yes. This padded stuff might have bought us a
little protection on the water problem and another
problem with it though.
28 56 08 C What's that?
28 56 10 P The ammonia stuff.
28 56 25 C ... anything ... ammonia ...
28 56 33 P That's the way it was explained, anyhow.
28 56 45 C Do you want to try closing the faceplates and ... ?
28 56 52 P You know, it doesn't bother me. I feel lousy every
time I wake up. It takes you a while to get feeling
good again.
28 57 11 P Here's the data book.
28 58 43 C ... bag, but I don't know what I'm going to do
with it.
28 58 49 P Which one? Oh, those ...
28 58 50 C Aw shoot!
28 59 04 C I wonder if we should dismantle the ... what did
you do with it?
28 59 06 P It's up in a bag behind my shoulder.
28 59 14 C Where, the lens?
28 59 16 P You don't have to dismantle it, Jim. The lens is
right here.
28 59 19 C I know. I said, "Where is it?"
28 59 21 P The lens is right here.
28 59 23 C There's no need to really dismantle the other one
if it works.
28 59 26 P No, that will fit that lens.
28 59 28 C No, I wasn't worried about the lens. I was worried
about the camera.
28 59 31 P Oh.
28 59 38 P We've got a lot of movie film we might as well take.
28 59 40 C We've got a lot of other kinds of film we better
take ...
28 59 50 P The only thing, we're not keeping good books on it
right now.

	Page 156
28 59 52 C You're telling me! It's lousy!
28 59 59 P You keep books and then you miss other things.
29 00 04 C We've been using the blank paper ...
29 00 07 P I think we've missed a section, though.

	Section CARNARVON

29 15 00 CC Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Over.
29 15 09 C Go ahead, Carnarvon. This is Gemini 4.
29 15 11 CC Roger. Read you loud and clear. You're looking
good here on the ground. How are you up there?
29 15 15 C Everything is fine.
29 15 19 CC Pilot still asleep?
29 15 22 C Went to sleep about 15 or 20 minutes ago.
29 15 25 CC Roger. Can you give me the attitudes you were
holding when you went past Ascension?
29 15 31 C How long ago did I go past Ascension?
29 15 35 CC Oh, let me figure it out here. Hold a second.
29 15 50 CC About 20 minutes ago.
29 15 54 C I can't tell you.
29 15 56 CC Okay. Did you hear Cape CAP COM talking - Houston
CAP COM to you on air-ground transfer over Ascension?
29 16 03 C Roger. I did. He came in for about two or three
transmissions, and then that was all I got.
29 16 09 CC Roger, was he pretty garbled?
29 16 11 C Yes, he was. And as a matter of fact, now that you
mention it, I wasn't parallel to the ground. I was,
I think, maybe pointing just about straight up.
29 16 20 CC Roger. Your nose was straight up.
29 16 22 C Just about like that. However, right now I'm pointing
about straight down so we're in pretty good
shape.
29 16 27 CC Roger. I'm receiving you now, better than we have
on almost any pass.

	Page 157
29 16 32 C Okay. Stand by. I think we're also on the adapter
antenna here.
29 16 36 CC Roger.
29 16 38 C Yes, we went to adapter when we started playing with
the HF cheek, and we just left it there. And it
seems to be working just as well as the reentry
does.
29 16 48 CC Roger. Seems a little bit better here.
29 16 51 C Yes, we sure had a lot of radio trouble to start
with, but it seems to have all smoothed out.
29 16 56 CC That's the way we want to go.
29 16 59 C Hope things get better, and not worse, huh?
29 17 01 CC Say again.
29 17 03 C As long as things get better, instead of worse.
29 17 11 CC Let's give that stub antenna a try. If you don't
read me in about 10 seconds, come back to this
frequency on this antenna.
29 17 25 C Gemini 4 here, how do you read me on my nose?
29 17 28 CC Okay, I read you just slightly garbled. How me?
Over.
29 17 31 C Loud and clear.
29 17 33 CC Okay. Let's go back to the antenna again.
29 17 35 CC The adapter.
29 17 37 C Roger. On the adapter. How do you read me now?
29 17 39 CC It's just about the same.
29 17 45 C How do you read Gemini 4 now?
29 17 52 CC Okay. We'd like you to go back to the nose stub
antenna.
29 17 59 C Carnarvon, Gemini 4. You're all broken up now.
29 18 02 CC Roger. Will you switch back to your nose stub
antenna.
29 18 12 CC How do you read me?
29 18 14 C I read you loud and clear. I'm back on the nose
antenna.
29 18 19 CC Okay. Will you remain on that antenna, please?

	Page 158
29 18 19 C Okee-doke.
29 18 20 CC Okay.
29 18 26 CC Okay. We don't have anything else for you. We'll
be standing by if you have anything you want to say.
29 18 30 C Okay. Fine.
29 40 33 C ...

	Section HAWAII

29 40 45 C ... Hawaii ...
29 52 09 CC Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
29 52 12 C Go ahead, Guaymas. Gemini 4.
29 52 14 CC Roger. We've got you green, how are you doing up
there?
29 52 17 C Fine. I just saw something else up here with me,
but just as I was getting close enough to it to take
a good picture, the sun got in the way and I lost it.
29 52 26 CC Roger. We got some flight plan changes for you.
Want to stand by to copy?
29 52 29 C Yes. Stand by and let me see if I can find this
thing again.
29 52 45 C ... and there are a great number of thunderstorms
around at the present time. Lightning is actually
lighting up the interior of the spacecraft ...
activity ... thunderstorms ...
29 53 35 C Okay. Go ahead. It doesn't look like I'm going to
see him again.
29 53 39 CC Roger. First item, delete D-8 at 23 hrs G.m.t.
29 53 49 C What is its elapsed time?
29 53 53 CC It's 31:45, elapsed time.
29 53 58 C What is it in G.m.t.?
29 54 02 CC 23:00 G.m.t.
29 54 06 C Okay. Got that?
29 54 08 CC Perform the D-8 that was scheduled for 33:20 elapsed
time - perform that at G.m.t. 40:00.

	Page 159
29 54 22 C Okay. Delete D-8 at 33:20 and perform it at 40:00.
Is that right?
29 54 30 CC That's 00:40.
29 54 34 CC My fault. Did you copy that?
29 54 40 CC Okay. Third item scheduled do D-8, start time of
02:15 G.m.t.
29 54 52 C Okay. We'll have a new D-8 at 02:15 G.m.t. How
many D-8's did we delete?
29 55 00 CC We deleted one; the one at 23:00 G.m.t.
29 55 08 C Roger. Thank you.
29 55 10 C You deleted that one and then put in the new one
at 02:15?
29 55 13 CC That's affirmative.
29 55 14 CC Perform S-6 at 00:15 G.m.t.
29 55 22 C That was S-6 at what time?
29 55 24 CC 00:15 G.m.t.
29 55 30 CC We want you to use minimum fuel on that one.
29 55 33 C Roger. Use minimum fuel on all of them.
29 55 36 CC Roger. Roger.
29 55 38 CC ... at 22:35 G.m.t.
29 55 48 C ... you want S-6, one at 00:15 and one at 22:35.
Is that correct?
29 55 55 CC That's affirmative.
29 55 57 C Okay.
29 56 04 CC Roger. S-6 is a cellular cloud formation.
29 56 11 C Roger.
29 56 13 CC That's the one at 00:15 G.m.t.
29 56 28 CC Okay. MSC Experiments 2 and 3 at a G.m.t. of 30.
29 56 39 C A G.m.t. of what?
29 56 41 CC 30 minutes.
29 56 44 C How many hours? I've got the 20 minutes; how many
hours?
29 56 47 CC 00 30 00.
29 56 50 C 00:30.

	Page 160
29 56 51 CC Roger. Go BFT on - BEF, rather, on Experiment 2
and 3.
29 57 02 C Okay. On MSC-2 and -3, G.m.t. is 00 30 00.  We'll
be BEF at that time.
29 57 09 CC That's affirm - you still looking at that thing up
there?
29 57 12 C No, I've lost it. It had big arms sticking out of
it, it looked like. I only had it for just a minute.
I got a couple of pictures with a movie camera
and one with the Hasselblad; but I was in free drift,
and before I could get the control back I drifted
and lost it.
29 57 29 CC Good show.
29 58 17 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
29 59 06 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
29 59 17 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Over.
31 04 37 CC Gemini 4, CSQ. Would you turn your computer on for
a 21-4 update?
31 05 04 CC Gemini 4, CSQ. Be advised that this pass is live
on the TV networks back home.
31 05 19 CC Could you give me your quantity read on?
31 05 31 CC I have got your 21-4 backup guidance quantities.
Are you prepared to copy7
31 05 59 CC Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
31 06 10 CC Gemini, CSQ, do you copy?
31 06 14 C CSQ, Gemini 4. I read you.
31 06 17 CC Roger.
31 06 19 CC Are you, - what's your status for 33-1?
31 06 23 C We're good.
31 06 26 CC Okay. We're GO on the ground. I've got your 21-4
load prepared to transmit. Am transmitting now.
31 06 35 C Roger.
31 06 37 CC Roger. Your load is in. I've got your 21-4 backup
guidance quantity. Are you prepared to copy?
31 06 49 C Go ahead. I'm ready.

31 09 42 C I'm getting the ... out ... and I'm pointing toward
the south and somewhat more towards the rear
than toward the sun.
31 10 00 C See any clouds up there to take pictures of?
31 10 03 P ...
31 10 49 P I guess I'll turn the computer off.
31 10 51 P ... go back to ACME.
31 10 59 C Yes, what did you say?
31 11 01 P ...
31 11 01 C Oh, okay.
31 11 08 P I'm going to try to check the tape. Okay. I'm
going down to ACME.
31 15 06 C ... clouds. They look like stratus, but they
certainly have a moderate effect to it. I wonder
if all this weather is going to be in the Hawaiian
land area?
31 15 13 P It looks like there are several layers to it. A
very high cirrus layer ... a little less cirrus
... take some pictures of a series of clouds. It
looks like we've got a high cirrus layer with fair
weather cumulus below it.
* CC I read it when you are ready to copy.
* C Roger. I have 3 53 23. Is that it?
* CC That is negative. It is 23 58 23.
31 16 42 C Roger, 23 58 23.
31 16 45 CC Roger.
31 16 50 C Thank you.

	Page 162
31 16 58 CC Also, S-5 Experiment. MCC requests crew take
terrain photos of any clear areas along the ground
track and not wait until last day. Crew should
identify which areas they are. Did you copy?
31 17 37 C Roger. Understand they want us to take areas of
terrain wherever it is visible, and not to wait
until the last day. Be advised we would like to
save some film, though, until we get the opportunity
to make a pass across the Southwestern United States
tomorrow, and take a bunch of sequence photos along
there, if it is okay.
31 18 00 CC Roger. That's fine with us. Roger. That's fine
with us. Go ahead.
31 18 32 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
31 18 35 C Go.
31 18 36 CC Can you give us your battery read-out if you did
not give it to CSQ?
31 18 41 C Roger. We didn't give them to CSQ. We'll give
them to you in just a minute.
31 18 45 CC Roger.
31 19 15 CC Gemini 4, Hawaii.
31 22 49 C Taking some pictures of clouds at 22:39 ... down

31 25 50 C Go ahead, Guaymas. Gemini 4.
31 25 52 CC Roger. You look good from the ground. Would you
turn off your Quantity Read Switch?
31 25 57 C It's off.
31 25 58 CC Roger. I'm standing by for battery read-outs.
31 26 03 P Roger, Gemini 4. You ready to copy?
31 26 05 CC Go ahead.

	Page 163
31 26 07 C Roger. The adapter batteries are all reading 2 on
the amps and 24 volts. The RCS rings are holding
up well. The Secondary O<sub>2</sub> bottles are holding up
well. The main batteries are reading 9 and about
22.5 to 23 volts. The control bus is *, S2 at 26,
S2 is 26, and the main is 23.5.
31 26 36 CC Roger. You might look for a tropical storm over the
west coast of Mexico. You should be right on top of
it about 22:43 Zulu, which is right about now.
31 26 50 C Understand. We'll be looking. We're over some
pretty good weather right now ...
31 30 10 C Just took a frame of some thunderstorm buildups
...
31 31 01 C Okay, I guess we can ...
31 31 15 P You know, it's not too light in here right now, is
it?
31 31 20 C No. it isn't ...
31 31 37 P Smile! You're on Candid Camera.
31 31 42 C ...
31 31 44 P Yes, it takes about 4 inches. No, wait a minute,
I don't feel it moving.
31 31 49 P I think I know why.
31 31 50 C Did you have it on?
31 31 54 P Didn't have the other thing on.
31 31 57 C Oh, no. I know why! ... isn't enough to make
that thing run.
31 32 03 P No, I didn't have the auxiliary switch on. I'll
feel it run. It's running.
31 32 08 C ...
31 32 15 P ...
31 32 34 C ...
31 33 01 C Okay. I just took a picture of two thunderstorms
that look like big pancakes, with a lot of cirrus
running out around to the side of them, but different
tops.
31 33 13 P You're ... take a picture just looking out the
window.

	Page 164
31 33 30 P ... picture.
31 33 37 C ... over here, Ed?
31 33 37 P Yes.
31 33 42 C I have got a good view of the line ...
31 33 44 P Yes, but you're not going to get anything ...
31 33 46 C What?
31 33 51 P ... the ...
31 33 52 C Yes, I know it. That's what I want.
31 33 54 P Let me know. Got it on?
31 33 55 C Yes, it's on.
31 34 10 P Okay. What I want to do, Jim, is get out these
other lenses. I think we can take some excellent
movies with four lenses.
31 34 20 P Hold the sextant box?
31 34 25 C Is that where the sextant is?
31 34 27 P The sextant's between my legs.
31 34 31 P It's catching on the top, too.
31 34 39 C ... get it, Ed. Just don't break it.
31 35 42 P We really want to use it on the telephoto shots.
31 35 44 C Yes. Where is the data book?
31 35 56 C Why don't you go back to sleep?
31 36 01 P No, I'm all fired up now ...
31 36 40 P Start over on that, Jim.
31 36 44 C ...
31 36 54 C ...
31 38 20 P Magazine here is 619.
31 38 32 P We're on RECORD now.
32 05 01 C ... the stars.
32 05 13 P I'm coming down on the horizon now, and you can
certainly see the definite two layers to the air
glow, the one that is quite thick at the top, and
you can see the stars as they drop through it.
32 05 27 C You mean the one that's dim?

	Page 165
32 05 29 P Yes. Yes, and as the stars drop through it, they
occult a little bit; then they pop out on the left-hand
part and you can actually see them go out all
the way out as they hit the true horizon down at
the bottom. It looks like to me - what would you
estimate if you took the included angle. I would
include that angle at about 7 or 8° say, from here.
32 05 49 C ...
32 05 51 P I estimated it higher before.
32 05 56 C The dense layer at the top is about a third ...
32 05 58 P Yes, I'd estimated it about a third or sixth.
32 06 05 P I used the green filter on the sextant, and the
green filter does make a clearer and more defined
horizon than no filter at all. Would you like to
take a look at the sextant?
32 06 20 C Yes ... horizon.
32 06 27 P You've got a good one now, don't you?
32 06 32 P I'm unwinding it out ... the umbilical right now.
Here it comes.
32 06 34 P Okay. There it comes.
32 06 39 P Sure is easy to move things around, isn't it? That
8-pound sextant, you just handle it like it weighs
an ounce.
32 06 46 C ...
32 06 49 P Try the green filter. See if you don't feel it makes
a more defined horizon.
32 07 15 P Now we've got what I would consider darn near perfect
star-seeing conditions with the moon effect as
small as it is. As we were saying before, the magnitude
of the stars - it looks like we can go right
down to seventh order or maybe just a hair below,
using our calibration, the Corona Australis. I
have a little flash right out in front of me out
there.
32 07 41 P Yes.
32 07 53 C ...
32 07 56 P You saw all kinds of what?
32 08 01 P Yes. Oh.
32 08 05 C ...

	Page 166
32 08 15 P Jim, I'm going to take a check on the tape recorder.
I don't trust it since the bulb didn't work on it
the last time. Will the lights bother you?
32 09 20 P It looks like the tape's still running through and
I haven't gotten the red light yet. That is sure
unsatisfactory - the location of the tape recorder
light. The whole tape recorder - that's right, the
whole tape recorder operation is wrong. It ought
to be something you can have on in continuous so
that you can talk over the radios, also. Particularly
on launch - you end up not getting any of that
on tape.
32 10 01 C Okay. I just started my ...
32 10 15 C ...
32 10 20 P Is that right?
32 10 22 C ...
32 11 08 C ...
32 11 34 P I'm going to go ahead and time a star coming up
through it.
32 11 37 C Okay.
32 11 44 P See how long it takes.
32 12 03 P Right now it's entering the dim part.
32 12 17 P And, out it comes.
32 12 25 P It took 49 1/2 seconds to come up through. Let's
see if I can duplicate that. Get another measurement.
32 12 44 C ...
32 12 46 P A degree and a half. Boy, that sure is deceiving.
32 14 08 P Okay. Now I've got a good star. I started it
early. You know: down below the air glow it kind
of peters out to just about nothing, where the stars
start coming out, and then they start moving into
the air glow. I see a star very clearly and now
it's starting to come into the air glow.
32 14 32 P On that first measurement I made I really didn't -
I think the air glow starts down below - a little
bit below, where, looking at it from here, it looks
like it really starts.

	Page 167
32 15 10 P Oh! Did you see that flash? Huh? Yes. A very
bright flash right on the air glow. It was on your
side. A very bright flash and went out.
32 15 25 C No, I didn't see it. Is the recorder on now?
32 15 29 P Yes.
32 15 34 C 2°, 25 minutes.
32 15 41 P How many, Jim?
32 15 44 C 2°, 25 minutes.
32 15 45 P Okay.
32 15 49 P Shucks! Now keep a bright eye out your window,
because the area I saw is in your window now -
where I saw the flash. It was right at the top
of the air glow.
32 16 05 P Boy, are the stars good now!
32 16 20 C It sure looks funny right down below us ...
32 16 23 P Yes.
32 16 25 C The lights of the city and then on the horizon out
there are the blinking lights ... upside down
... side-up.
32 16 34 P There! See it again? Out your side?
32 16 41 C You're not kidding. That was on the earth.
32 16 44 P It was shooting down toward the - that one was much
lower.
32 16 46 C Oh, it's shooting down into the earth.
32 16 49 P Yes.
32 16 50 P Wonder what that was?
32 16 52 C Maybe it was a falling star.
32 16 53 P I don't know.
32 16 58 C ... wearing that big bulky suit to protect you
from those falling stars.
32 17 01 P Yes, I checked my suit very closely, and I saw no
meteorite holes, much to my delight.
32 17 15 P Okay. I tracked a bright star, and I believe that's
out there in Aquila. In fact, I'm quite sure. I
can see the two target stars. I've tracked it all
the way up. It's almost to the top. It's going to

	Page 168
go out of my view right now. I had him all the
way from the bottom, and it took 3 minutes 23 seconds
to come all the way up. That was tracking a
big star like Altair.
32 17 46 C ...
32 17 51 P No. No. Come right up from the bottom of the horizon,
up through the air glow layer. From the first
time, I saw it till it reached what I consider the
top of the air glow layer, it took 3 minutes and
23 seconds.
32 18 03 C Long time, isn't it?
32 18 05 P Much longer than I thought, and it started way down
... That's why I was looking for a bright one
like that.
32 18 25 P Yes. Look out and see if you don't see Altair out
your side. See Aquila, the two ... stars?
32 18 37 P Drifted down to the bottom of your window, if you
see it at all.
32 18 46 P It may never come up to your view.
32 18 58 P Corona Australis came up.
32 19 05 P What? I know. I tried to make a measurement that
way. Sure doesn't work very well, does it?
32 19 22 C Yes, it just doesn't work when the world is upside
down.
32 20 20 C I think we are about to have a sunrise.
32 20 29 P ...
32 20 46 C ...
32 20 55 P Okay.
32 21 17 C ...
32 21 22 P Yes ... burning up ... and what I saw went
right into the air glow. There goes another one!
See it?
32 21 47 P ... is deceptive as far as the altitude ...
32 21 58 P ... the fireflies ...
32 22 29 P I think the ... the red light ... ought to
change it.
32 23 13 P What?

	Page 169
32 23 14 C ...
32 23 15 P No. I was going to catch it as it came out so I
could catch the strange effect of one side in sunlight
and the other side in night. I'm going to
start turning it on now at 19 and see what I get.
Should be pretty dark ...
32 23 55 P You're in the daylight over there, aren't you?
32 24 01 P ... right kind of film.
32 34 17 P Okay, we're starting Film Tape Pack no. 11. We
Just finished with no. 9. It looked like the light
came on that pack. We'd better check to see if
no. 8 has some way of turning the light on. It
might be the film tape magazine that causes the
light not to come on.

your relative bearing was when you sighted the

32 40 51 P Roger. Stand by one, please. Do you have a relative
bearing for them?
32 41 00 P Yes, I'm pulling it, but I'm not getting anything.
Just the same way as it was when you were doing it
for me.
32 41 10 P Is this valve screwed up here in any way?

	Page 170
32 41 14 P Yes, I'm pulling.
32 41 24 C Roger, CSQ ... and the satellite was up near
the sun. My small end started drifting up on us,
drifting slightly. And I saw the thing over the
small end which I think was pointed toward the east.
32 41 38 C ... I saw it over the small end, which I think
was pointed toward the east.
32 41 52 CC Gemini 4, CSQ. You were not up on the first part
of your transmission. I got, "Saw it over small
end and you believe were pointed east." What was
the first part of your transmission?
32 42 02 C Roger. My small end was up above the horizon so I
couldn't see the horizon. As it came around toward
the sun I saw the - this other satellite, but then
as the sun came in through the window I lost it because
the sun was so bright.
32 42 17 CC Roger. You were looking into the sun then, when
you saw it?
32 42 20 C That's affirmative.
32 42 22 C Okay. Pull harder.
32 42 27 CC Okay. I got your 33-1 load up. I've got your 33-1
backup guidance quantities when you're prepared to
copy. We had a little problem last pass. We had
a complete power failure about two-thirds the way
through the pass.

32 42 44 P It's the same thing that happened to me ...
32 42 48 C I'm not being too successful.
32 42 51 P I wasn't either.
32 42 53 C I'm getting it all over me as a matter of fact.

dump it. End up doing the same thing I did.
32 43 20 C Yes. Shoot! I got it all over. Maybe we're
getting it on there too tight, Ed. You know that

32 46 20 P I'm taking some general - normal lens on the 16-mm
photographs of the water and the clouds at the present
time. We've been having a lot of trouble with
the ON/OFF button on this camera. It goes only
about every third or fourth actuation. This might
explain some of the reason why Jim didn't get as
much film on that first - in our EVA work.
32 48 08 P For analyzing these films - we're taking them at
00:04. We're taking them of the ocean and the cloud
background. They look like they have fair the weather
cumulus with the characteristic cirrus above. I'm
taking quite a lot of them on the flight.
32 56 41 P I'm taking the S-6 photographs on the second pass
through the Pacific cloud area. We're taking the
first picture now.
32 57 24 P We're starting with Frame no. 35, Film Pack no. 7.
Using the same old setting - 250 at 11 ...

32 58 00 P I'm also taking some pictures with the 16-mm camera
of the same area, with the normal lens.
33 01 17 P Feels like the shutter is sticking on at the
Hasselblad at the present time on some of these
pictures. This is the second series of the S-6
pictures over the Atlantic. The film-advance
mechanism is definitely causing erratic operation
of the Hasselblad. I'll be operating it manually
from here on.

35 13 40 P We passed the United States space record. And we
have got a very important tape dump at 03:03. I
think it was over CSQ, and they wanted ... up for
it. I asked them - I said, "Are you getting all of
our timed taped dump?" They said, "Perfectly." I
said, "Why can't we just remain in drifting flight,
powered down?" They said, "Stand by."

35 47 57 C Roger. We've completed the D-8 Experiment. We're
ready to copy.
35 48 02 CC Roger. Also be advised to leave both the Biomed
recorders on for the reminder of the mission.
35 48 11 C Roger. We've used them a little on the sequence.
I think we'll leave no. 2 off for another 30 minutes.
35 48 19 CC Okay.
35 48 24 CC Okay. I believe you've got Area 25-3. Is that
affirmative?
35 48 29 C Say again.
35 48 30 CC I say, I believe you have Area 25-3.
35 48 38 C Negative. We do not.
35 48 39 CC Okay. All the days will be the second day. I'll
just give you the GMTRC times. Area 25-3: GMTRC 05 51 18. 
8+14. 16+55. Area 26-DELTA: Delta-V 86. 1+49. 06 51 37. 08+47. 13+03.

35 52 35 CC That's it.
35 52 38 C Roger. What was the reverse bank on that? The
400 K on the last one?
35 52 44 CC Okay. The last 4 - the last 5, the CLA's do not
have reverse bank times at this time.
35 52 52 C Roger. Are you ready for readback?
35 52 57 CC Stand by.
35 53 01 C Area 26-DELTA.
35 53 03 CC Roger. Area 26-DELTA: 86 delta-V. 1+49. 06 51 37.
8+47. 13+03.
35 53 26 CC Did you copy?
35 53 34 CC Gemini, CSQ. Do you copy?
35 53 44 CC Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
35 55 16 C I just took pictures ... Frame 51 ...
35 56 14 C I just took Frame 52 on the Hasselblad Film Pack
no. 7 ... high deck of clouds ... very sharp
break ... The break is ...
36 00 00 P I've taken two pictures on the S-6, and I believe
they are right along the inter-tropical convergence
zone. There is a nice band of heavy cloud build-ups
... in a line approximately in line with the
equator.
36 00 20 C Golly, ... really is ... out there ...
36 00 28 P I guess I'd better not.
36 02 04 C Oh! I'm just about dry ...

	Page 182
36 02 33 C ...
36 02 36 P Yes.
36 03 06 P Maybe they're down there computing very carefully
whether we can go for the extra ... hours.
36 03 11 C ...
36 03 15 P Go after that extra ... teen hours.
36 03 21 C ...
36 03 24 P You know, go after the 5-day -
36 03 26 C Oh, no! Ha! Ha!
36 03 28 P We got an extra load of food onboard.
36 03 35 C ... we have fuel enough?
36 03 35 P How much OAMS we got? 70 - 60?
36 03 40 C No, 70 ...
36 03 43 P We've got one more than we're supposed to have.
36 03 47 C ...
36 03 48 P ... dirty rascal ... !
36 03 57 P We're supposed to have four per day for each guy.
36 03 59 C ...
36 04 04 P ... double bags.
36 04 09 C ... meal ... bags ...
36 04 18 P You know better than that. Ha! Ha! You're just
being unbearable. Ha, ha, ha!
36 04 28 C ...
36 04 30 P Kind of reminds me of a T-bird. Ha, ha!
36 04 32 C ...
36 04 34 P Kind of reminds me of a T-bird, you know. Here I
am ...
36 04 37 C ...
36 05 13 P We ought to try to see if we can see our water tank.
36 05 28 P Hey, here's our box.
36 05 33 P Right here ...
36 05 42 P ...
36 05 50 C Did you put a question mark by ... retros, ... ?

	Page 183
36 06 09 P I did, too.
36 06 15 C Okay. Now, right now, ... daylight ... sure
daylight.
36 06 23 P Well, we're getting in dark. I can see dark here
too, Jim. Let's see on one of these nights or days
see what we can and can't see.
36 06 40 P These cinnamon toasts are all right.
36 06 49 P ... All right before. I don't think so -
36 06 51 C I don't think so.
36 06 51 P No, ... plain toast ... These are coated with
something.
* C ...
* P Yes. Pretty good. It's all a function of how it's
been ...
* C ... toast is all squashed ...
36 07 06 P ...
36 07 08 C Yes. I didn't ...
36 07 12 P Pretty good, Jim. Try one.
36 08 20 C Those are good.
36 08 23 P Yes, very good.
36 08 33 C ...
36 08 35 P ...
36 18 16 P Going to an extra exercise period - the second
exercise period I've had that wasn't an official
part of the flight.
36 19 04 P Okay. I did it for a count of 60.
36 19 09 C Maybe I can ...
36 19 12 P ...
36 19 13 C ...
36 19 30 P Well, I started out with 5 pencils and I've got
3 left so -
36 19 35 C I started out with 2 and have 1 left. I mean, I
started out with 2 and I've got 2.
36 19 42 P Oh, yes. I put it there.
36 19 45 C That's an opportunist ...

	Page 184
36 19 49 P Yes.
36 19 57 P Well, let me see. I don't know whether to put my
gloves on or not. How's everything look over there?
Not bad, huh? I believe I'll try it without them.
Let me see. Where's the visor? I think you handed
it over to me, didn't you? I'm looking right at
the Southern Cross. Very pretty.
36 20 27 C I think I did, Ed.
36 20 28 P I think you did, too.
36 20 54 P Do you want the movie camera?
36 20 57 C Yes.
36 21 05 P Do you want the "Y" connector? Now, I took this
off the Hasselblad. It was fouling the pictures up.
36 21 06 C What was?
36 21 08 P This was.
36 21 09 C ...
36 21 09 P Oh, the shutter wasn't dropping right. It was
dropping delayed, remember?
36 21 15 C ...
36 21 18 P No. Not that way, though. I had this pushed all
the way down in. It was getting in there and sticking
in there like this. So there's the "Y" connector
if you want it.
36 21 35 C ...
36 21 42 P I've got a normal lens on it.
36 21 46 P We're running out of what?
36 21 48 C Hasselblad pictures.
36 21 52 P Still not more than we had bargained for?
36 23 21 C Sure wish I knew how our water supply was doing
back there.
36 23 25 P I do too.
36 23 28 C ...
36 23 37 C ...
36 23 44 P I don't think so. Do you?
36 24 04 P ...

	Page 185
36 24 04 C ...
36 24 08 P Why don't you see if you can see, Jim.
36 24 16 P That's really neat!
36 24 18 P Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.
36 24 21 P Maybe you can direct it better.
36 24 23 C ...
36 24 37 C ...
36 24 42 P No way of telling, huh?
36 24 47 P I think the lens cover's got a couple of fingermarks
on it.
36 25 15 P Hey, I never did find the sleeve cover.
36 25 23 C I'm pretty sure ...
36 25 25 P I think you did, too. I've always left it right
there before, though ...
36 25 49 P Turn that big spotlight off.
36 25 57 C ...
36 26 04 C You really ought to be able to ...
36 26 17 P You see it over here toward me?
36 26 28 P Yes, that we can be assured of.
36 27 09 C ...
36 27 27 P How about under me? See it under me anywhere?
36 27 33 P I can reach in under there. That's the first place.
I looked.
36 27 37 C ... not on your suit.
36 28 01 P That exercise eats you up in this bunny suit. I'm
not going to do that anymore.
36 28 09 C ...
36 28 12 P What do you mean?
36 28 13 C What did you do, bleed all over the seat ... ?
36 28 20 P I don't know.
36 28 22 C ...
36 28 23 P I'll bet it is. What do you mean, Jim?
36 28 26 C Oh, you know that big ... on my desk?

	Page 186
36 28 28 P Oh, yes.
36 28 37 P No, I'd say we're *
36 28 40 P I feel like I'm up to my ... for survival in the
Arctics ... in the tropics ...
36 28 47 C Ha! Ha!
36 28 49 P I feel like one of the ... you know?
36 28 52 C ... about 30 or 20 minutes ...
36 29 01 P ...
36 29 04 C ...
36 29 07 P No. Not unless we do something about the hatch.
36 29 16 C ... being able to stand up and then going outside
through the hatch opening.
36 29 21 P That's right.
36 29 33 P ... it didn't look as strange from outside as it
did from inside, from ...
36 29 37 C Yes.
36 29 37 C I reached over here one time ... a picture of
where I thought you were.
36 29 42 P Oh, really?
36 29 45 C I don't know whether I got it.
36 29 47 P Well, that lanyard - the shape of the spacecraft -
it just kept me up here all the time. I'd go out
here and tether dynamics would bring me back up in
here. And then I'd operate back this way. We
didn't think of that when we designed that anchor
point on there.
36 30 09 C All of our preflight plan worked out. Didn't it?
36 30 16 P What do you mean?
36 30 19 C ... Ha! Ha!
36 30 22 C ...
36 30 25 P You have daylight out in front.
36 30 28 P But go get over on your side. But my first whole
maneuver was done over on this side. Did you see
me the first time I went up?
36 30 35 C I couldn't.

	Page 187
36 30 37 P Did you see me - Was I out in front of you one time?
36 30 44 C Yes.
36 30 45 P Was that when I was yawing right - left a little bit?
36 30 49 C Yes.
36 30 50 P Shortly thereafter was when I ran out of fuel, wasn't
it?
36 30 53 C Yes. It didn't last very long. It really went in
a hurry.
36 30 54 P Where did I use up all of my time?
36 30 57 C I don't know. Your time or your fuel?
36 31 03 P I was out there that long too, wasn't I?
36 31 06 C ...
36 31 09 P I heard him. I heard him when we finally went off
VOX - "GET HIM IN!" Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Did you hear
him?
36 31 20 C Yes. I said, "Have you got any instructions for
us?" "YEAH, GET IN!"
36 31 24 P Ha! Ha! Ha! Who was it? Was that Gus? I thought
it was Chris.
36 31 30 P I think at that time I was standing on top of the
spacecraft. No, I wasn't. I was out there. That
was when I saw Cuba, wasn't it?
36 32 16 C Hey, Ed!
36 32 18 P I'm trying.
36 32 23 P That ... cool it down.
36 32 31 P I've got to sit down and tape more on that tape
than I have ...
36 32 46 P Have to get my ... and get a good ... on getting
out of the spacecraft. What we need is a big spacecraft
with a big inward opening hatch - just like
they have on a submarine.
36 33 17 C Port opening?
36 33 18 P Yes, so that the pressure inside seals the hatch.
36 33 25 C ...
36 33 28 P No. You have to have a ...
36 33 39 P This is pretty ...

	Page 188
36 33 42 C Right here?
36 33 44 P Yes.
36 33 46 C ...
36 33 52 P I think we've got to do something better. They've
been trying all types of things -
36 33 59 P Look at that thunder and lightning storm.
36 34 01 C ...
36 34 03 P Yes.
36 34 04 P I wonder where we are, Jim?
36 34 08 C ...
36 34 10 P Let me just check these and then I'll go to sleep.
36 34 14 C ... to get tired of it.
36 34 16 P Okay.
36 34 22 C ...
36 34 25 P You're right. I hate to go to sleep.
36 34 40 P Let's just check what time those are and then we
can find out where we were later.
36 34 44 C ...
36 34 45 P Okay.
36 34 46 C ...
36 34 49 P Saw a great many thunderstorms down below us. It
looks like we're going approximately small-end-forward
and we're upside down. Very, very heavy
thunder and lightning activity. And the time is -
what was that time, Jim?
36 35 20 C 10 ti11 4.
36 35 21 P 10 till 4?
36 35 22 C Right.
36 35 24 P And I'm going to sleep. We're going blunt-end-forward
because the stars are setting.
36 57 11 C We're presently over the Arabian Peninsula at 04:13.
36 57 23 C Taking pictures of some of the sand dunes down here.
36 57 55 C ...
36 58 20 P ... the recorder ...

	Page 189
36 58 24 C Okay.
37 14 05 C That last picture I took was ... time.
37 53 55 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is RKV CAP COM.
37 54 08 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4. RKV CAP COM.
37 54 21 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is RKV CAP COM.
37 54 31 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4. RKV CAP COM.
37 54 39 C Roger RKV, Gemini 4. Go ahead.
37 54 41 CC Roger. We have your oral temp. Pump up your blood
pressure, please.
37 55 31 CC Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
37 55 33 C Go ahead, RKV CAP COM.
37 55 36 CC Roger. Would you give us the blood pressure please?
37 55 52 S Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. Would you pump it up a little
more, please?
37 55 58 S I'll give you full-scale when you're there.
37 56 15 S RKV Surgeon. Try it there.
37 56 24 S Gemini 4, this is RKV Surgeon. You're getting a
phased run-down on your blood pressure. Would you
check your setting to be sure it's in?
37 56 52 S Roger Gemini 4, this is RKV Surgeon. You are still
not getting a good blood pressure but before you
try it next time would you check your fitting end
be sure you don't have some loose trash or something
inside the O-ring.
37 57 10 C This is Gemini 4... the blood pressure.
37 57 20 S Roger. We got - we're getting good blood pressures
from Ed, so keep trying it for a while. Could you
go ahead and get your water and sleep report now,
though.
37 57 53 C Okay ... last four hour period ... I got about
an hours worth of sleep ...
37 58 04 S Roger. Did you say Meal D of the first day and
Meal A of the second day?
37 58 10 C The second day ... Meal A of the second.
37 58 25 S RKV Surgeon. Roger. CAP COM has something for you.
37 58 31 CC Roger. Have you checked your wet and dry bulb
temperatures as of yet?

	Page 190
37 58 39 CC Gemini 4, RKV.
37 58 41 C GO ahead, RKV.
37 58 43 CC Roger. Have you taken your wet and dry bulb temperature
readings?
37 58 48 C Roger. We've been taking them right along.
37 58 50 CC Roger. Could you give me a read out?
37 58 52 C Stand by one.
37 59 08 C Dry bulb between about 72 and 79. A little bit before
that they ran between 75 and 77. Wet bulb last
group was between 57 and 61. Preceding group between
60 and 65. Let me get you a relative humidity here.
38 06 39 C It's approximately 05:25, passing over South America.
Whole series of thunderstorms down there that are
bright enough to be actually shining up into the
spacecraft. Very, very violent.
38 19 05 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
38 19 18 C Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
38 19 20 CC Roger, Gemini 4. Reading you loud and clear. Did
you get your map update for revolution 25?
38 19 26 C Roger. It was 3° West and 05:36.
38 19 32 CC Roger, 5 west 05:33. Did you get the S-6 experiment
update?
38 19 38 C Negative. What did you have to say about that?
38 19 40 CC Okay. Typhoon Babe is still off Formosa. You will
be over it at 06:06. Weather advises there's a new
storm area that you will be over at 06:13 G.m.t.
We'd like some pictures if you can get them. No
fuel usage. Did you copy that?
38 20 21 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston. Did you copy the S-6?
38 20 37 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
38 21 02 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is Houston. I will give
you a 27-BRAVO update if you can read. It is a
split burn. Forward 76. Aft 94. 2+07. 1+58. 09 12 06. 9+30. Did you copy? Over.
38 21 41 C Negative. Say it again please.
38 21 45 CC Roger. Area 27-BRAVO: Split burn. Forward 76.
Aft 94. 2+07. 1+58. 09 12 06. 9+30. Over.

	Page 191
38 22 17 C Roger. Could you give us back your last dry and
wet bulb temperature on your humidity check?
38 22 29 C Roger. They were about 75 and 77, but our humidity
was around 60 percent.
38 22 37 CC Roger. Copied that.  If you can, get your left and
right cabin wall temperatures using the thermostat.
Also, report on visible moisture, if any, and is
your blotting paper wet to the touch? Over.
38 23 00 C Roger. The - I took the wall temperature quite some
time ago in the left-hand food box and it was 75.
The blotting paper is not wet to the touch, and
there is no visible moisture.
38 23 14 CC Understand no moisture and not wet to the touch.
Could you give me an estimate on the completion of
your experiments D-9, S-6, and S-5, or roughly how
much you've done on that?
38 23 29 C We haven't been able to do anything with D-9 that
was when we could record any data. We are going
to... We ... For S-6 we need one long pass
over the United States to take a series of 35 pictures
across the southwestern United States. ...
to point the spacecraft down at the ground while we
take a string of pictures.
38 23 53 CC Understand you need one more pass on S-5 and you
have a fair amount of S-6. Is that affirmative?
38 24 00 C We have a fair amount of S-6. We've had some
scattered S-5 sightings ... pictures, but we need
one run over the United States at least, and we'd
like another one over the - over North Africa if
we can work it in.
38 24 14 CC Understand. I copied that. For your target of opportunity
on these experiments, we'd like to give
them a priority of no. 1, S-5; no. 2, S-6; and
no. 3, D-9, if possible.
38 24 35 C Roger, it's going to be pretty tough to get a D-9
without any fuel.
38 24 39 CC That's affirmative. D-9 without any fuel.
38 25 04 CC Gemini 4, that's all from Houston. We'll be standing
by. We have about 1 minute to LOS.
38 27 00 C Arabian Peninsula ...

	Page 192
38 29 24 C I just shot frames 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 over North
Africa. ... * Frames * ... 6 ...
Arabian Peninsula, taken out of the ... right
through the middle of the Peninsula, looking out
towards one of the ... there.
38 32 19 C ... toward the Persian Gulf ...
39 05 45 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is Houston CAP COM.  We
have Canton under ... We'll be standing by.  Over.
39 06 26 CC Gemini 4, Gemini 4. Houston CAP CAM. Canton.
Standing by.
39 27 52 CC Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.

39 28 14 CC Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
39 28 17 C RKV, Gemini 4.
39 28 20 CC Roger. Are you reading?
39 28 23 C I read you loud and clear, RKV. How me?
39 28 25 CC Roger, you're coming in real good. We have an
Apollo landmark for you. Are you prepared to copy?
39 28 38 C All I received was are we prepared to copy. Are we
prepared to copy what?
39 28 44 CC Roger, it's an Apollo landmark.
39 28 50 C Stand by a second.
39 28 58 C Okay. Go ahead.
39 29 00 CC Roger, it's Cairo in the 26th rev. G.m.t. 07 18 37.
12 miles northwest, that is northwest of the track.
Slant range 90 nautical miles.
39 29 43 CC Gemini 4, do you copy?
39 29 44 C Roger, Cairo on the 26th rev. G.m.t. 07 18 37.
12 nautical miles northwest of track. 90 miles
slant range.
39 29 57 CC That's affirmative. Our Surgeon would like to talk
to you.

39 30 04 C Roger, RKV Surgeon. Go ahead.
39 30 07 S Roger, I have a couple of questions for you. First,
about the blood pressure. I don't want to bug you
very much on it, but did you change the O-ring?

	Page 193
39 30 17 C No I didn't. I looked at the O-ring and I don't
think it's the O-ring. I think it's my ... I
noticed when I got checked out the other morning
just before launch, that they had a little trouble
with it then. I ... the blood pressure moves.
It looks like a problem with my suit. Would you
like for me to try to give you another one?
39 30 39 S Negative, there's no reason to do that right now.
I have some more questions for you. If you aren't
doing anything towards the end of the pass, we could
try it.
39 30 46 C Okay.
39 30 50 S First, a couple of questions on your general condition.
How restful do you think your sleep is?
39 30 57 C Well, it's not very restful. This radio feeds
through into the other helmet, he can hear it,
not very loud, he's got his ... but he can hear
all the radio transmissions and ... it keeps waking
you up.
39 31 13 S Roger, do you feel like you are dry or dehydrated?
39 31 20 C No, possibly I did notice, oh, at the end of about
the 6th or 7th pass, I drank quite a bit of water
... And got to feeling better. I've been eating
and drinking right along now so I don't feel
dehydrated at all.
39 31 35 S Roger, your voice sounds a little dry to us down
here and you do think you are getting enough water
to drink now?
39 31 42 C Yes sir, I think I'm being dried out by the oxygen.
My nose did bleed ... after launch.
39 31 54 S Roger. Jim, go ahead and keep pumping the water
down because we have plenty aboard.
39 32 00 C Well, I hate to run out, you know, after only 3 days.
39 32 04 C Roger, White is drinking a good bit. I'm just about
to start on my meal B of the second day, and Ed's
sleeping now and when he gets up, he's going to eat
his.
39 32 17 S Roger, if you have some time now you may give me a
blood pressure.
39 32 21 C Okay.
39 32 54 S You are full-scale - Beautiful! - That's a beautiful
record, Jim.

	Page 194
39 33 26 S Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. That's a good record. We
have a good blood pressure on you.
39 33 31 C Okay, very good. I think I give you a good one
every third or fourth time.
39 33 37 S Good average.
39 33 44 S Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. We have nothing else. We'll
stand by for your comments if you have any.
39 33 49 C Roger. I think I'll ... I imagine we're powering
... at the end of 4 days, besides from that we're
in pretty good shape right now.

39 57 11 CC Roger, the score in the game that Eddie White is
Dodgers 11, Yankees 10, Eddie's batting was 1 for 3.
39 57 27 C ... now we'll keep quiet.
40 00 22 P I can see a black fire down on the desert. You can
see right down to the very source where it's coming
from. I couldn't see exactly what it was, but it
made a very, very distinct mark on the ground. I've
taken several S-5 terrain pictures as we crossed the
desert at 07:17. Feels like we've got a failure in
magazine no. 7. It feels like one of the dogs isn't

40 14 19 C No, I haven't taken very many. Have you?
40 14 25 P I want to start working on ...
40 14 26 C Come on! Go to sleep! Listen, you'll be awake in

                 little info on how your control went over North
                 Africa, and how much pulsing did you do?
43 32 12    P    Roger, we used Pulse Control in a minimum amount;
                 the target of number 12 was obscured by clouds; I
                 had the time and location pretty well squared away.
                 I could have tracked if I could have seen the target,
                 I believe. Target number 13, it was in the
                 clear, and I was able to pick up the city of
                 Alexandria. The airport I think I ... but I
                 haven't been able to put my attention on looking
                 for the airport. I could have spotted the airport.
                 I went ahead and operated the camera and took some
                 pictures as I passed over it. The location of the
                 target from the data called up was satisfactory.

45 50 51 P On your mark.
45 52 03 S Blood pressure is received. Standing by for your
food and water report. We have your feces report
from Canaries at 09:06 Zulu.
45 52 11 P Roger. I understand. I have completed the second
meal. I've had approximately 6 swallows of water.
I've also had a good use of the defecation bag, and
everything is in good shape.

	The following timestamp is out-of-order in the original, recorded as 45:49:53

45 52 53 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Put your Quantity Read
Switch ON and leave it ON until I tell you. Over.
45 53 01 P Roger. Will do.
45 53 03 CC Roger. I have some Flight Plan updates. Are you
ready to copy?
45 53 19 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM Are you ready to copy
Flight Plan updates? Over.

45 55 11 CC That is affirmative, Gemini 4. Also concerning
Experiment MSC-1, we would like you to turn your
ACQ Aid Beacon OFF for a period of about 5 minutes
during the period of your MSC-1 Experiment. Recommend
you do this between Kano and Carnarvon this

45 55 57 C Roger. Understand you want MSC-1 Experiment going
to ACQ Aid Beacon turned OFF for 5 minutes.

	Section BERMUDA

45 56 11 CC That's affirmative, Gemini 4. They want about
5 minutes of this experiment with the ACQ Aid
Beacon OFF when there are no UHF transmissions.
45 56 22 C Do you want me to go to REAL TIME-DELAYED TIME or
do you want me to turn OFF the ACQ Aid with the
circuit breaker?
45 56 28 CC Roger. Use the circuit breaker.
45 56 30 C Okay.
45 56 38 CC Gemini 4, Houston. We'd like a repeat of your food
and water report.
45 56 42 C From the Pilot, or do you want to do one from me?
45 56 45 CC That's from the Pilot, please.
45 56 53 P Roger. This is the Pilot. About 3 hours ago, I
had Meal 2, day 2. I had about 4 or 5 swallows of
water. I had a successful yes on defecation bag.
45 57 12 CC Roger, Gemini 4.

45 57 39 CC Sound great.
45 57 41 C Thank you. How are you?
45 57 44 CC Had a good night's sleep.
45 57 47 C I got a little more sleep this time than I have in
           the past.
45 57 49 CC How about that plug in your throat there. Have
            you taken that out when you were sleeping?
45 58 01 C Oh. Negative, I didn't disconnect my radio. I
           left it on.
45 58 05 CC Did it bother you at all?
45 58 08 C It has been up till now, but this time I guess I
            was pretty tired, and I slept without it.
45 58 13 CC Very good. ... Gemini 4, Houston. You can turn
            your Quantity Read Switch OFF now.
45 58 30 CC Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. You can turn your
            Quantity Read Switch OFF.
45 58 34 C Roger, it's OFF.
45 58 38 CC Roger, you're looking good here. Have a good day.
45 58 41 C Roger.
45 59 12 CC Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. We have your
            O<sub>2</sub> tank pressures around 970.

46 05 29 CC Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
46 05 31 C Go ahead, Canary, Gemini 4.
46 05 34 CC Roger. Request that you use the Cabin Recheck Valve
            instead of O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. Also, be advised that
            Houston says do not relieve through the cabin if you
            can avoid it.


	Page 207
	Approved? True
	Page 205
46 05 34 C We don't need a push.
46 05 54 C We don't have any other place to put the oxygen
           except in the cabin. We've just finished doing it
           to the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. We got the ECS O<sub>2</sub> pressure
           down to 910.
46 06 02 CC Roger. They were warning you to avoid relieving
           through the cabin area.
46 06 06 C O<sub>2</sub> pressure down to 910.
46 06 09 CC Roger. I understand 910.
46 06 10 C Can you tell me why they want to use the Repress
           instead of the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate? Where else would we
           put the oxygen?
46 06 20 CC Roger.
46 06 24 P Jim, we're not ...
46 06 30 C Well, he said that in order to get MSC-1 they wanted
           the ACQ Aid Beacon OFF for 5 minutes. You know,
           you were going to leave - to do some ECS on and
           off ... thruster.
46 06 41 P Okay.
46 06 50 P Cabin temperature comes ON at - I put it ON already.
46 06 53 C I don't know ...
46 06 58 C ...
46 07 03 CC Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
46 07 05 C Go ahead.
46 07 07 CC Roger. The reason for using the Repress was to
           avoid turning off your fans and to cut down on your
           noise level in your cabin.
46 07 17 C Okay.
46 07 20 CC They meant do not relieve overboard if you can avoid
           it.
46 07 26 C Oh, don't ... they don't want to vent the ECS O<sub>2</sub>
           tank overboard directly. They want to vent it overboard
           through the cabin. Is that it?
46 07 34 CC They don't want to avoid overboard at all if possible.
46 07 36 C Roger, I know it.


	Page 208
	Approved? True
	Page 206
46 07 52 CC Okay. Your O<sub>2</sub> usage for the last 24 hours -- correction
-- over the last 2 or 3 hours has been
25 percent higher than normal.
46 08 00 C Roger. Our cabin's been holding all right. There
really doesn't seem to be much we can do about that.
That tank pressure goes up and that is just about
all there is to it. We're actually venting oxygen
overboard that we don't need to.
46 08 14 CC Roger.
46 08 19 C How is our O<sub>2</sub> consumption? I've been plotting it
and it looks like we're in reasonably good shape.
46 08 40 P It doesn't really call out for my time hack ...
46 08 44 C Okay.
46 08 50 P ... get a drink of something.
46 08 52 C I'm thirsty.
46 08 56 CC Your rate even at your present rate - you have 5 or
10 hours more than you need plus secondary O<sub>2</sub>.
46 09 03 C Okay, fine. Thank you.
46 09 07 C And I'll try to take your advice and not vent any
overboard, but I just don't know how I'm going to
do that.
46 09 12 CC Roger, we understand.
46 10 00 P You know, it's going to be tough getting 14 ...

I'd like a few readouts from you.
46 39 10 C Okay.
46 39 11 CC I'd like OAMS source helium temp, pressure, and
propellant quantity.
46 39 35 C Propellant quantity - I have about 61 percent remaining.
It fluctuates a little between there and
about 63.

46 40 56 CC Okay, we're standing by here on the ground if you
need anything.
46 40 57 C We're preparing to do Experiment D-9, and we probably
won't have any transmissions for you.

46 58 40 CC Go ahead.
46 58 43 P We are starting the first run of Apollo. We have D-9, Ru -

47 01 09 P Is it coming in your side?
47 01 09 C Yes ...
47 01 21 P Yes, that's right. We're yawed around to the right.
47 01 36 C Yes, how's the horizon look?
47 01 41 P My horizon's real good.
47 01 48 P Just coming in.
47 01 51 P High? ... up?
47 01 52 C Straight up above.
47 01 55 P Okay. Stand by.
47 01 56 C Yes, I know. I don't know how they expect us to
sight ...
47 02 02 P Shucks.
47 02 07 P It's an awfully high one to give us.
47 02 12 P ...
47 02 15 C ...
47 02 17 C Okay, now you ought to be able to see something
without any trouble.
47 02 26 P The sky?
47 02 36 P ... come on, yet.
47 02 38 C ... Southern Cross ... star chart. We ought to
be able to see that.
47 02 48 P ...
47 03 04 P I think I see Antares. I can never get down - not
in my view.
47 03 14 P ...
47 03 14 P Clear at the top of my window.
47 03 19 C Yes ...
47 03 21 P I can't possibly - I can't get this down underneath
far enough. There, hold on.

47 03 50 C Too high?
47 03 52 P Yes, way too high. I can't possibly get it unless
you pitch up to it and yaw back down.
47 04 02 P No, - yes, but we didn't get it. I've got Gemini
coming up now. No, that's not Gemini, that's part
of the Southern Cross.
47 04 19 P No, it crossed right through - high.
47 04 26 P Yes, I saw it go across the very top of my window.
Is that where it was on yours?
47 04 38 C Right now, you're not even seeing ...
47 04 43 P Okay, now I think it's coming where I can see it.
47 04 57 C You've got to have a whole segment ...
47 05 07 C I can take a sighting on it now ...
47 05 14 P Yes, I got a sighting from it.
47 05 16 C Did you?
47 05 17 P Yes.
47 05 52 C ...
47 05 52 P Roll to the right.
47 05 52 C ...
47 05 57 P Huh?
47 05 57 C ...
47 06 02 P Yes, roll it.
47 06 07 P Yes, the horizon is gone and I ... The star's
too high with respect to the horizon.

47 08 50 P It's only 23° right now ...
47 09 02 C ...
47 09 28 P Can you roll it to the left a little bit; I have
           too much horizon now.
47 09 28 C That's what I think. How about rolling it just
           horizontal?
47 09 50 P Oh, boy, there goes all the "O" rings.
47 09 57 C Okay.
47 10 02 C I can't get the horizon.
47 10 04 P Okay.
47 10 33 C How are you?
47 10 38 C I can't ... star.
47 10 52 P The horizon's gone now.
47 10 55 C When?
47 10 56 P I don't have a horizon anymore.
47 10 58 C Disappeared.
47 10 59 P Yes.
47 11 02 C Same here with me. I don't know whether I'm up,
           down, sideways, or anything else. I like to at
           least know the orientation.
47 11 07 P Okay, we never got a good one on that.
47 11 09 C Okay, we've been running into problems.
47 11 12 P We tried to get Antares twice.
47 11 36 C Can you see into this side?
47 11 38 P Not ... try bring myself around.
47 11 43 C You can control it if you like.
47 11 48 P I might be able to get it better that way.

47 12 45 P Okay, I got it. But before I can shoot any stars
I've got to get this stuff behind me, or I won't
see a star. What are you looking for? Okay. I've
got it pitched this way and roll it back in there
or I won't see anything.
47 13 16 P I guess it's not.
47 13 21 C See any stars?
47 13 26 P A few stars - okay. Yaw more to the right.
47 13 26 P Okay. The stars are back out again.
47 13 38 C No, I didn't expect ...
47 13 52 P What I have to do is keep my window shaded all of
the time.
47 13 55 C Yes.
47 13 55 P Out of the sun and then I can see.
47 13 58 C Oh yes, I can see stars.

47 15 26 P ... one time.
47 15 31 P I'm supposed to have the proper attitude.
47 15 40 P I can roll back over now, though.

47 17 38 P Neither can I.
47 17 43 C ...
47 17 45 P Okay, you go ahead and see if you can find any.
47 17 47 C ...
47 17 52 P They're just not there.

47 18 28 P Yes, ...
47 18 33 C Okay, we're starting to pitch up close to the horizon
now, and ...
47 18 43 C Okay. Blunt-end-forward so the sun's behind us.
47 18 48 C I still see no stars.
47 18 50 P No, neither can I.
47 19 02 C I have a black sky out there, but I'm getting reflection
off the window. How about you?
47 19 07 P Yes, I get a lot of reflections off that dirty outside
part.
47 19 11 C Half of my window is black and the other has a little
sun shining on it. Sun shining on the nose of the
spacecraft so I've got to look past a lighted object.
I don't see a star, and I never have seen the stars
in the daylight... much better at sunrise when
half the spacecraft is dark and the other half is
light.
47 19 31 P Yes, then you can see it.

[Experiment] D-9 cannot be done in the daylight.
47 20 02 P I concur.
47 20 07 P Right now, there doesn't seem to be a way for us to
find any stars in the daylight.
47 20 07 C No, it sure doesn't. There's no way you can see
them.
47 20 10 P There is certainly no way to do it after ...
47 20 19 P Okay.

47 20 38 P ...
47 20 40 C ... okay, ... look out ...
47 21 43 C I don't see a star anywhere.

47 22 02 P Yes.
47 22 19 P Yes ...
47 22 21 P Okay.
47 23 33 C My window's not in the light anymore, and I still
don't see the stars. If there's any possibility in
the world to see stars in the daylight and horizon
at the same time, I'm in the position right now
where I should be able to do it. And don't have
the sun on the nose of the spacecraft. It's on the
bottom. I can see the bottom, and I can't see a
single star, not a single star.
47 23 39 C Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
47 23 40 CC Roger, are you busy with [Experiment] D-9?
47 23 43 C No, I think it just drew to a close. We just can't
see the stars in the daylight, and we can't carry on
the daylight portion of it. We'll wait till we get
back to the nighttime and do a little bit more with
that.

47 24 00 C Okay.
47 24 01 CC We don't think it's any problem. We would like for
you to put your Quantity Read Switch ON and leave
it on for the next several hours so we can get a
feel for what's going on. Even at the rate that's
been used in the last several hours, it won't be
any problem, but we'd like to find some way to control
this thing without it being a nuisance to use
so you won't be bothered with it. That's the reason
we want to take a look at it for some time. Don't
like the idea of you having to reduce pressures or
build up pressure every few minutes. Do you read
me?
47 24 41 C Houston, Gemini 4. I got the part where we leave
the Read Switch ON for a while, and then all the
rest cut off. Say again.

but that's all cleared up now.

47 32 45 C Yes, I did, and Ed was saying that his headache is
gone. He had one earlier.
47 32 50 C And I don't have one yet, but I feel closer to
having one now than I have had at any time. I

Do I sound that way to you, too?
47 33 23 P Yes.
47 33 26 C ... But I think because of this 100 percent oxygen
where I kept assimilating it. I suspect that
maybe my ears and my sinuses are always below ambient

47 50 14 P Zero or just a little left. Right there.
47 50 16 C Okay.
47 50 18 P The ES sensor is coming off at this time.
47 51 57 C The right side of my head is getting sore where I
keep rubbing the hair the wrong way when I try to
turn my head inside my helmet so that I can look
through the window long ways. Get the best view I
can through it.
47 55 53 C Okay, we're just now approaching darkness again and
we're looking at stars with small-end-forward and
as yet, I don't see any. It's under my ...
47 56 11 P ...
47 56 33 C I think it does too, Ed.
47 56 38 C Okay, now half of what I see is light and the other
half is dark. So we're going a little bit sideways
to the small-end-forward, but Ed's side is in the
dark completely, I believe. Isn't it, Ed?
47 56 50 P I see a star ...
47 56 50 C Okay. First star was at 15:12 - 15 12 52 it was.
47 57 02 P Right.

47 57 53 P ...
47 57 54 C No, I think the gradation of this goop that's all
over it, whatever it is, looks like it's on about
here on up - looks like it's on about the zero
pitch line on up.
47 58 06 P There's plenty of stars out there, now.
47 58 09 C Okay, I still don't have any stars.
47 58 21 P There's a very pretty horizon out there now.
47 58 26 C Okay, I have my first star. - I'm quite sure that
this coating on my window is about zero pitch attitude
line on up. I can see a star down below that
... you'd think I'd be able to see it. It might
just be the peculiar way the reflections are coming
back through the window.
47 59 11 C Okay, Edward, I'm going to leave the recorder on

47 59 18 P I've done that already.

make these measurements. You can't expect to make
these measurements without using any fuel. It's

           5 to 2. They're still in sixth place though.
48 58 37 C Okay. He's got this information for you.
48 58 39 CC Go ahead.
48 58 40 P The batteries were 9 and 22.5.
48 58 44 CC Roger. 9 and 22.5.
48 58 47 P All the rest of the electrical readings are up.
48 58 50 CC Say again.
48 58 51 P The rest of the electrical readings are normal.
48 58 53 CC Okay. Fine.
48 59 06 CC Next time you bleed down your primary oxygen pressure,
           bring it all the way down to about 800 psi.
           We can't find much else that we can do about the
           thing. Just bring it down lower so you are working
           through a wider band. We don't think that is going
           to cause you to use any.
48 59 28 C Roger. Bring it down. Listen, I just then ran the
           thing up to about 5 1/4, and I'm trying to hold it
           at 5 1/4 with the Repress ... hold it. If not,
           I'll bring it down to around 800.
48 59 40 CC Okay. We think you can go way down in your pressure
           now without hurting anything, so if it gets to be a
           nuisance just bring it on down so that you don't have
           to watch it so close and be bothered with it too much.

49 00 01 C Okay.
49 00 20 C At about 16:03, as we came across on this last pass,
           across the Gulf of California, the Mexico side, we
           were in a perfect small-end-forward down attitude

49 00 44 C Go ahead, Houston. This is Gemini 4.
49 00 50 CC Roger. Could you give us an estimate as to how far
           that satellite was from you yesterday?
49 00 57 C I couldn't really tell. It looked like quite a
           large object, and it looked like I was closing on
           it rather rapidly. Distance is rather hard to
           judge. I'd say 10 miles or so.
49 01 10 CC 10 miles?
49 01 11 C That's just a guess. I really can't tell. I was
           close enough where I could see -
49 01 19 CC You were close enough to see what?
49 01 21 C ... arms and cylindrical things sticking out.
49 01 26 CC You're cutting up pretty badly, there. I couldn't
           read that.
49 01 30 C Okay.
49 01 31 CC Well, that came through good.
49 01 33 C All right. I said, I got close enough to it ...
49 01 39 CC Close enough to it to what?
49 01 41 C ...
49 01 44 CC Well, as near as we can tell, there wasn't anything
           that close to you. Pegasus was about 1200 miles
           away.
49 01 49 C No, it wasn't quite that close -- that far away.
49 01 57 CC Pretty good eyeballs, all right.
49 01 59 C Well, I took a picture of it. I just hope it comes
           out.

49 02 14 C No, I'm using continuous interphone, PUSH-TO-TALK.
How do you read me now?
49 02 17 CC Good. Every now and then the last part of your
sentence cuts off.
49 02 22 C Okay, maybe I have a weak thumb. Listen, would you
ask the doctors if it's okay if I use this exerciser?
49 02 29 CC If you use it?

I'm getting.

southern part of the United States down around
Alabama and Mississippi and on across to Florida.
We got some very good pictures of the weather in
that area, then we got some pictures of the air
fields around Jacksonville. We took a couple of

               starting with Florida and going all the way back to
               Texas. A very well defined line of weather following
               closely to the coastline. Then we took some
               pictures of the weather formation in the State of
               Florida, around Cuba and the island area, and into
               the gulf ... weather build-ups, clouds, and we

53 17 34 S Gemini 4, Surgeon, CSQ Surgeon. Would you repeat
your eating?
53 21 21 P I'd like to comment a little on the sextant. Its
use in a cramped spacecraft is very difficult,
particularly with the helmet on. I finally decided
it was going to be useless with your helmet on to
try to take the angles that the stars, that were
being called for, required. So I took my helmet
off. This gave me a little more flexibility in
using it, but still I was limited to angles of about
20 to 23° without maneuvering the spacecraft. What
would happen if the star would be cut out by the
upper part of the window. Now, by more frequent
and liberal maneuvering of the spacecraft you could
maneuver it so that you have the long axis of the
window in your tracking plane. We were somewhat
limited by fuel and we didn't choose to maneuver in
this manner. We used Pulse Mode, too, without a
lot of maneuvers. The stars that were selected for
that run were ones that had rather high angles so
the horizon and, therefore, were very difficult to
get. We finally decided to go ahead and get the
stars a little closer to the horizon. I ran a
couple on Canopus and a couple of others, as you'll
notice. The blue filter seemed to block out the
horizon totally; I didn't have any horizon when I
used that. Our horizon image probably is not as
good when there is moonlight. The green filter,
though, gave me what I would consider a little
clearer horizon than I had with no filter at all.
I felt there was not a difficulty in making these
measurements with either the green or clear filter.
Still, the horizon is not very well defined and you
have to kind of standardize yourself and measure on
the same part of the horizon that you did before to
get some type of a standard measurement. To me it
was easier to measure with no filter to the top of
the airglow. With the green filter I liked to
measure the bottom of the airglow.

66 16 41 C I am sorry. This is the Command Pilot. I ...
There were 5 and 1/2 hours and I would guess that

one time and the urine system about four or five
times, I guess.
66 17 30 S Roger. A question on medication. Have you taken any
medication?

leaky water valve. Now, I've had only one other
drippy bag so far, and we're already about 60 something
hours into the the flight. But every single
orange juice bag has had a leak in it. And Ed just
came up with another leaky orange juice bag for himself.
But this is Ed's first one.

we were able to pick up the airport at Cairo. However,

I never did really see the airfield. I just saw the area. I guessed if I pointed the camera right, I'd have a picture of Cairo. But this time I actually picked up the airfield. Same thing with
Alexandria. I think if you are going to take a

about 30 minutes to come up before we can start
alining it.
67 16 20 CC Roger. Understand.
67 16 22 C Okay.
67 16 24 C We're going to start the power at 10:50.
67 16 25 CC Very good.
67 27 13 C Gemini 4, again. I see the same sort of curve of
lights, like the northern lights except they are
below us, and I saw them another time, they were
great big long lines. Looks like they run about
parallel to the direction of our flight path and
they extend from just below the airglow in the
earth's horizon, up a little bit past the top of
the airglow. The same thing I saw the other night
except that it's not quite as bright as it was then.
67 27 44 P It reinforced the airglow.
67 27 47 C That's right. It looks like it reinforced the air
glow.
67 27 50 P Reinforced the air glow more down to the bottom.
67 34 06 C Got IGS power on the line and platform to CAGE SEF
at Houston.
67 35 35 P The ... thruster went on at 10:52. 10:51.
67 35 42 P MARK!
67 40 52 P I just saw a falling star trail down not too far in
front of us and it burned out considerably below us.
The whole tail --was quite long, which was actually
below our level. It burned up considerably below
us.
67 41 10 C Yes.
67 48 35 C We are starting the MSC Experiment at 11:04.
67 48 49 P If we had an event timer track Experiment at 11:04.
67 48 54 C Don't think we can.
67 48 56 P Get it at Carnarvon. We can't get out and fire them
normally ... Glad we got it at the right time
anyway.

P No.
67 51 01 P That looks almost like a normal sunrise, doesn't it?
67 51 03 C That's what it is.
67 51 06 P Well, you know, that's not what you expected it to
be. I -- I don't have the lens on right.
67 51 25 P It's coming up on 4 minutes now.
67 51 29 C I've got 3:40. Lens is on right.
67 51 41 P Well, it sort of slipped down.
67 51 44 C Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
67 51 51 P That would have been something, wouldn't it?
67 51 56 C Yes.

to get it to aline properly.

72 36 34 CC Okay. Now I've got quite a bit of information to
pass up to you here. We would like for the Pilot,
who is asleep, to leave his face-plate open and his
gloves off. And then we would like for the Pilot
that is awake to take off his helmet and gloves and
use the light-weight headset for communications if
he can. And we would like for you to continue this
way up until about 3 hours prior to retrofire. Then,
once in orbit, at your convenience, we would like
for you to take a wet and dry bulb reading and just
at any station give us a report of what it was and
what time you took it.
72 37 24 C Okay. We have been operating with the face-plate
open and gloves off now for about the last 12 hours,
but mostly in that situation we kept oversleeping.
When we sleep we generally close the visor and put
the ... cover to keep the light out of our eyes.

72 37 52 CC Roger. Okay, Jim, we decided that you've got a little
bit of fuel left that we can play with here in the
Flight Plan. We would like for you to go to the
Horizon Scan Mode for the next 8 hours. That's at
an elapsed time of about 80:30, and we want you to
use the Primary Scanner. We don't want you to do
any controlling in yaw, and if the scanner breaks
lock, don't control in roll or pitch either. We
want to see - if it breaks lock, we would like to
see if it will reacquire.
72 38 33 C Okay. You want the horizon scanners on for the next
8 hours.
72 38 36 CC Affirmative.
72 38 38 C 80 hours elapsed time.
72 38 39 CC Roger.
72 38 41 C Okay, Gus. For flight planning purposes, we haven't
been able to do much with D-9, because we haven't
been using the fuel for it. We ought to save a
little fuel to do that.
72 38 51 CC Okay. We got no problem. Go ahead and use your
D-9. Now, on the Apollo Landmark no. 2, we would
like for you to be in attitude for that at 17:19.
G.m.t. of 17:19. And the landmark will be 16 miles
north of track, and you should be pitched down about
minus 30° at that time. And we would like for you
to track this as close as possible and to get some
pictures using the 16-mm camera with 75-mm lenses
with a nominal lens setting.
72 39 32 C Roger. Will do.
72 39 34 CC Do you want me to repeat any of that?
72 39 36 C Negative. Apollo no. 2 at 17:19. 16 miles north
of track. Pitch is down about 30° and use the 75-mm
lenses at that time.

to try sleeping with your helmet off. Try sleeping
with your face-plate open, I'm sorry.
72 41 49 C I don't know. The sun really gets in your eyes, Gus.
I don't think we'll try that. Ed has tried sleeping
with his helmet up and then down and right now he
just slipped it up. He's having a tough time with
the sun. I tried it, and I can't do it.
72 42 05 CC Okay. Can you just put the shade over anyway?

72 42 17 C Actually the last 12 hours or more, maybe as much
as 24, we haven't been too careful about keeping
our face-plate closed and our ... bands up because
obviously, the humidity isn't going up.
72 42 28 CC Yeah. Well, of course, that is what we are trying
to do. We are trying to get a good hack on what is
happening there. Maybe we don't have a problem like
we originally thought.
72 42 37 C Yes. I don't think we do. Essentially, Ed hasn't
had his face-plate closed for the last 12 hours,
and I only had mine closed when I was sleeping.
72 42 44 CC Okay. Well, go ahead and do what we asked as near
as you can and give us those wet and dry bulbs so
we can get a good spot on this thing.
72 42 54 C Okay. I have been running them right along and our
temperatures are running about -- the dry bulbs are
running 72 and 75, the wet bulbs between 60 and 64.
The relative humidity stands pretty close to around
60 percent.
72 43 08 CC Very good.
72 43 10 C Yes. And there is no visible moisture. And there
isn't any moisture around that blotting paper. Unfortunately,
you covered up the walls so that I
can't take the temperature, but the worst temperature
I can find is about 65.
72 43 24 CC Roger.
72 43 36 CC Jim, the Flight Surgeon wonders if he can say anything
about your eyes. Have you had any problems?
Any drying or anything at all?
72 43 45 C Yes. Listen, I had a lot of trouble with my eyes
at the end of the first day. I wasn't sure I was
going to be able to hack it. But they have cleared
up now. I think our little problem was taken care
of by the suit heat exchanger.
72 43 58 CC Okay. You don't have any problem at all now with
them?
72 44 01 C No problem at all. Though it was really bad between
about 18 and 36 hours.

75 43 16 CC This concerns the Zodiacal Light Experiment which
is going to be on "5", and they want to find out if
they're going to get any fogging of the film from
the attitude control thrusters. We'd like for you
to use your 35-mm Contarex camera, and you can use
either black and white film or color. And set it
wide open at f/18 with the range set at 8 feet.

of the camera open in the bulb position. And then
as you come up through the horizon, get another
picture of -- with pitch-down pulse with another
frame of the camera and again with the shutter wide
open at that time. And then we want the same type
of picture with pulse-up with the horizon view and
with the black earth in view and a picture with
pulse-down with the horizon view and the black earth
in view.
75 45 05 C Roger. Understand a pulse-up and pulse-down with
the bulb position on the 35-mm black and white or

85 35 13 CC Roger. I'd like to give you a little briefing what we came up with for the terminal reentry maneuver. Are you copying me clearly?
85 35 34 C ...
85 35 36 CC Okay. We looked at all the possible possibilities
down here. About the worst case we could come up
with is your 3-sigma error miss distance -- worst
case 70 nautical miles. That's 70. What we would
like to have you do is an OAMS retro maneuver; then
we will have a manual retrofire, of course, with no
computer. We want a zero-lift, rolling reentry.
That's zero-lift, rolling reentry. The reason for
the decision on the rolling versus a 90-90 bank is
that there's less chance of dispersions. They will
tend to equalize out. We feel we can have a faster
recovery that way. Also, doing it that way we can
get an IP prior to your blackout and you should pull
about 8g's on that reentry. Do you copy?
85 36 43 C Roger. Understand a maximum 3-sigma miss distance
of 70 nautical miles, an OAMS retro, a manual retrofire,
a zero-lift rolling, I got a faster recovery,
be able to plot point of impact.
85 37 10 CC Roger. You got all of that. Now this zero-lift
rolling only applies to your terminal maneuvers.
All your CLA's and PLA's onboard are still the 60°

88 57 24 C I just made a run on Target 16-A. The air field at
Basra, it's right at the Persian Gulf. I picked it
up -- I picked the Persian Gulf up about ... an
angle of about 30° ... I pitched down then
picked up the lake. ... northwest of the Persian
Gulf. Basra being right on the lakes, very near
the lakes, you can just follow over and pick up the
airfield right away. So I got the airfield out quite
a ways before I got to the target, and then just
started tracking on the target. I was actually on
the target by the time I was still 20° from the
vertical, I would guess - and tracked it on out from
the runway to about the 40° point past it, and I
stopped tracking. I had this 75-mm lens on the
16-mm camera with the adapter on it to take pictures
out the forward end and I had it running from the
last experiment ... for the target -
89 21 55 C Well, we saw Australia for the first time in the

islands of India. On across India to Malaysia and
on across to Australia ... we certainly -- only
passed about half so far.
89 22 12 C I've seen an awful lot of North Africa ... daylight
-- know quite well. I've just completed D-9
Apollo Landmark run on Target 14. I had a very
good pickup. I had seen the target before; I knew
where it was. I got right on the thing about 30°
below the horizon and got on the area, and picked
up the specific target at about 20°, 30° from the
vertical. Got on the target at about 30° from the
vertical and then tracked it to the vertical and

15° roll rate. When you reach 100 000, when the
altimeter comes off the peg, go to full lift. How
does that sound to you, Jim?
90 04 12 C Roger. I think I've blocked part of you out. Right
after retrofire we go to full lift and at .05g, or
at that time, we go to 15 deg/sec and at 100 000 we
go to full lift again.
90 04 25 CC That's right. The only difference between the format
before is that instead of the RET of 400 000
we'll give you .05g RET when you start your roll
rate.
90 04 37 C Okay, that sounds good.
90 04 39 CC This will give you a trim angle into the atmosphere,
a roll rate, and then full lift at 100 000 again for
your drogue and main deploy.
90 04 47 C Okay, very good.
90 04 50 CC Shades of Mercury, Jim.
90 04 53 C I was going to say I'll bet you Flight Directors
were thinking of this one.
90 04 58 C That's why I say not very imaginative, but I guess
it gets the job done.
90 05 03 CC Roger. I have a bet with your wife that you'll get
within 5 miles. Now you've got to hold up my end
here.
90 05 11 C Okay. I'm going to try to hold up my end, too.
Remember when I said we'd never make a closed
looper?
90 05 19 CC Doesn't look like we'll make one this time.
90 05 21 C Yes.
90 05 28 CC Hey, Jim, we're still going to pass you your updates

we'd like you to follow is: after retrofire, roll
to the normal position to a heads-down position,
for full lift to 400 K. We will give you an altitude
angle to hold down to 400 K, then we'd like you
to roll at 15 deg/sec till the altimeter comes off
the peg or approximately 100 K and then back to full
lift again till drogue.
94 36 47 C Roger, understand.

96 10 03 CC Okay. You want your time to 50 000 to drogue deploy
and to splash?
96 10 09 C Roger.
96 10 11 CC Okay. 10+55 to drogue deploy, and 17+10 to splash.
96 10 19 C Roger. How about main chute?
96 10 23 CC We don't have that one yet.
96 10 25 C Roger. 10+55 to drogue, 17+55 to splash, and standing
by for chute.
96 10 36 CC In case you don't get your complete OAMS burn, advance
your retrofire time by 2 seconds for each second
that you're short of your OAMS burn.
96 10 51 C Only 2 seconds?
96 10 52 CC Roger. Two for one.
96 10 55 C Okay. It used to be three for one. What happened?

96 10 59 CC No, it never was, Jim.
96 11 02 C It was about a week ago.
96 11 06 CC This is a new week.
96 11 11 CC Yes. Remember this is delta time now, not delta
velocity.
96 11 16 C Roger.
96 11 18 CC On your checklist, when you pulled your drogue pins,
did you pull your seat pins also?
96 11 25 C Roger. We weren't there yet. We'll get them, though.
96 11 34 CC Do you have everything stowed?
96 11 36 C Yes. We've got everything stowed as well as we can
stow it.
96 11 38 CC Okay. The weather in your recovery area is scattered
clouds, you've got 10 knots of wind and 4-foot waves.
It couldn't be better.
96 11 45 C Roger.
96 11 47 CC Okay. The doctors want to talk to you here just a
second.
C Okay.
S Jim? Both of you are in real good shape at the
present time and all the EKG's look just fine. Your
water intake has come up real well and from my last
computation here, both of you appear to be really
well hydrated for the reentry. I'd like to make sure
that both of you feel completely rested. Is that
affirmed?
C Oh, we're a little tired, but we're as rested as we
can be.
96 12 21 S All right, Jim. Do you feel that there's any need
for item bravo?
96 12 25 C Negative.
96 12 28 S Negative. Okay. I'd like to review with you this
blood pressure. You are not going to have the adapter
on until after you're on the water. Ed already
has it on, and we can tell from the data. He's to
get one blood pressure after retro, one on the chute
before bridle, one after bridle, and then both of
you every 15 minutes in the water. Affirm?

96 12 58 S Gemini 4, this is Houston Surgeon. Do you read?
96 13 02 C I got that Surgeon. We remember what they are.
96 13 28 S Gemini 4, this is Houston Surgeon.
96 13 30 C Go ahead Houston Surgeon. I got your message there.
96 13 33 S Roger. Okay. The other thing is the post-landing.
We still - just to reaffirm - you would like no
more than that 1 hour in the spacecraft. Get your suits
off, at your discretion, if the spacecraft
has no leak. The open hatch part is strictly your
decision. It looks good in the recovery area at the
present time for this. Remember the pumping exercise
that we did at the time of the physical, and
the feet up would be the preferable way. Are there
any questions about this at all?
96 14 10 C No questions.
96 14 12 S Roger. We'll look forward to seeing you on the
Carrier, then. Surgeon out.
96 14 18 C Okay. When are you coming on, Chuck?
96 14 20 CC This afternoon, Jim. Hope to be there shortly after
you are.
96 14 26 C Okay.
96 14 37 CC Is there anything else we can do for you, or is there
anything else that you want, Jim?
96 14 41 C Yes, my computer.
96 14 50 CC I wish I had an answer for that.
96 15 05 C What did you say?
96 15 07 CC You'd only have to compare it with my performance.
96 15 13 C You're unbeatable, Chris. I just unplugged it.
96 15 16 CC Roger.
96 15 42 CC Hey, Jim?
96 15 43 C Yes.
96 15 47 CC John just wanted to remind you that the toughest
part comes after you get back to the States.

I stowed the stuff, and I just took one right in
the middle of the cabin, and it was 75 or 78 and
62 wet. It hasn't gained appreciably since take-off.

96 55 42 C I'll just fly away, and then when we get down to
2:30, you give me a mark when we've been gone through
30 minutes.
96 55 47 P I'll talk to you just as we go along. I'll give you
a mark at 1-2-30-20-10 and count. Okay?
96 55 54 C Okay. Why don't you give me a mark at the end of
a minute.
96 55 57 P Yes.
96 55 59 C At the end of 2 minutes, then start counting down
from 30 when I've got 30 seconds to go. Tell me
30 seconds, 20 seconds, 10 seconds, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
96 56 09 P That's exactly what I said. That's good.
96 56 11 C I just wanted to make sure that that's what you said.
96 56 13 P Right. Okay.
96 56 15 C After so many clocks that we've been talking about.
96 56 28 C How long is it to RET? To 400 K? 2+38? Seems
awfully short.
96 56 34 P Yes.
96 56 35 P You sure you're looking at the right one?
96 56 37 P Positive.
96 56 40 C okay.
96 56 49 P We've had lot of them read up to us that short.

96 56 51 C Yes, I guess we did. But none of them were over
there. The OAMS retro is always a lot shorter.
96 56 57 P Oh, yes. You're down.
96 57 40 C Don't let me retrofire at 16°. Remember, it's 30°.
96 57 40 P Okay.
96 57 52 C There's something about the amount of fuel that I
have shown on my quantity gage, and the amount of
retrofire that we got here, that just doesn't figure
out.
96 58 01 P It should be higher.
96 58 04 C Yes, it looks like it. No, I mean on my OAMS
propellant.
96 58 06 P Oh, you mean -- you mean--
96 58 09 C Quantity reading.
96 58 11 P Yes, you mean you feel we're going to burnout short.
96 58 15 C Yes.
96 58 18 C ... 42 percent. About 100 -- 120 pounds showing.
That doesn't allow any cushion. Well, if we burn,
out short, that means we're going to overshoot -
long. So we can adjust our retrofire time forward
2 sec/sec.
96 58 52 P Hey, you want to get a few things dead ahead. You're
not going to use your FDI scale, are you? Want to
set it on HIGH?
96 58 59 C No, I'm going to use in on LOW for rate for the OAMS
retrofire.
96 59 02 P Okay.
96 59 11 C Ed ...
96 59 12 P You're going to fly ACME. Right?
96 59 14 C Going to fly ACME.
96 59 16 P Okay. And if you holler, I'll give you a different
one.
96 59 20 C Yes, and I'm going to fly roll gyros in all three?
96 59 23 P Right, and I'll be watching when --
96 59 26 C You knock off the roll if it looks as though I need
it.

96 59 33 C That sure was a peculiar way that thing was firing
out there. I was getting those yaw jets everytime
I fired pitch.
96 59 49 P You didn't do that in DIRECT, did you?
96 59 52 C No, I didn't. Yes, I still got them in DIRECT.
96 59 53 P Did you?
96 59 55 C I turned the roll off. No, I turned the roll off
and just used pitch.

OAMS Power, MANEUVER and ATTITUDE.
97 04 28 C Right.
97 04 32 P Spacecraft 0-90-0. Okay. We didn't do that before.
No sweat. All right, we completed that.
97 04 37 C Right.

97 05 18 P Okay. You're ahead of the checklist.
97 05 20 C Right.
97 05 23 P Now, no ground update.
97 05 25 C Where did we end up with the OAMS Power, Maneuver,
OAMS Power Switch? MANEUVER and ATTITUDE is in
ATTITUDE.
97 05 30 P It's in ATTITUDE and you'll get it at the minus 13.
97 05 35 C Okay.
97 05 54 P Okay. We're good now until minus 22.
97 05 56 C All righty. What happens at minus 22?
97 06 01 P Platform blunt-end-forward. Attitude Control, PULSE,
null FDI's (Ha! Ha!) and aline platform.
97 06 06 CC Is there anything else you want up there, Gemini?
97 06 08 C Negative. Well, I do still need my computer, but I
can't think of any way to bring it up.
97 06 15 CC Yes, I know what you mean.
97 06 18 P Okay, now till minus 13, there's nothing to do except
you get that platform alined.
97 06 19 CC I'll buy you a new one.
97 06 20 C Okay.
97 06 25 P I'm going to go back and re-verify the whole stuff
we've done.
97 06 28 C Okay. Very good.
97 06 32 P Okay. When I finish this, I'll put a new tape in.
97 06 37 C Okay.
97 06 56 C We're going to have the most alined platform in the
world. We will have been alined for an hour. We'll
probably come out of the darkness facing sideways.
97 07 01 P Yes, that'll be a shock.
97 08 06 C Hey, Ed, you know we always said that we were going
to make an open loop reentry. I'm much happier that
the computer failed and not the ...
97 08 14 P Yes, I'd rather be that way.

97 08 16 C At least we have an attitude reference for retrofire
and all the other operations. Hey, did we turn our
batteries ON?
97 08 20 P No, they don't come on yet. They come on down here
right in the minus 13.
97 08 44 P You have a minute.
97 08 54 C Temperature is not coming down much.
97 08 56 P No.
97 08 59 C Wonder why we don't have the cabin fan ON.
97 09 11 P Wonder if that's not on here.
97 09 16 C Did you go off the checklist?
97 09 18 P Yes.
97 09 37 P The batteries will come on the TR-5 checklist.
97 09 40 C All right. I guess we don't have to worry about
venting the ECS O2 anymore, do we? Ha! Ha!
97 09 45 P No.
97 09 54 C You have your Secondary O2 on too, don't you?
97 09 56 P Yes, mine's been on the whole flight.
97 09 58 C Very good.
97 10 04 C Hm! Hm! ... circuit breakers on ...
97 10 07 P No, I've been very sedate.
97 10 18 P I don't feel like I can strain as much as I used to
be able to.
97 10 20 C Right now, you mean.
97 10 23 P Yes. Do you?
97 10 25 C No. I feel pooped out.
97 10 28 P I tell you, I don't feel like straining anymore.

97 11 49 P Yes.
97 11 50 C How many did you have in the other one? Two in that
one, too?
97 11 54 P I think I only had one in there.

97 12 26 P Ha! Ha!
97 12 38 C Okay. Let's just go through our procedures a little
bit.
97 12 44 C TR-5. What are you going to do?
97 12 47 P I've got a checklist to complete.
97 12 49 C Okay. What is it?
97 12 52 P I'm going to start the G.m.t. stopwatch per your
time hack. I've already done about half of it. I'm
going to put the Main Batteries ON. Verify RCS
Propellant A and B -- ON.
97 13 04 P I'll verify that now. I'll check it again, but -
97 13 06 C Okay.
97 13 09 P Antenna Select to REENTRY, and it's already on
REENTRY. Propellant gage RCS-B, and I've already
set it to B. Quantity, OFF. Quantity is OFF. Indicate
Retro Attitude, and I'll ... I guess you've

97 13 32 C I've (Illegible) have something (Illegible) Power.
Remember we've always had that thing out of order.
97 13 38 P Yes. Okay.
97 13 40 P Let's put that Retro Power thing at TR-5 for you to do.
97 13 42 C Okay.
97 13 56 P Okay. I'll hit Indicate Retro Attitude, Sections 1
and 2 Power Control-OFF. Then you have some things:
Platform-ORBIT RATE, FDR-PLATFORM, FDM-RATE, FDI
Scale-High. Verify Rate Gyros-PRIMARY. I've already
done this. Attitude-RATE COMMAND.
97 14 20 P You're in PULSE now.
97 14 25 P RCS Power A and B-ACME, OAMS Power FF, OAMS Propellant - OFF. Control spacecraft to 0, 180 and -30. We're at minus 180 but not minus 30 yet.
97 14 40 C Right.
97 14 42 P At that time you'll put the Retro Power to ARM, but
we're going to move that up to the beginning so I
can indicate retro attitude.
97 14 49 P Okay.
97 14 50 C Right.
97 14 52 P Then you'll report the minus 5 completed.
97 14 55 C Okay.
97 14 56 P Okay. At that time I'll turn the Transmitter-Receiver
HF OFF. No. 2 -- RECORD. We should state
that. Now at minus 1 I'll push OAMS, ELECTRIC and
ADAPT. OAMS, ELECTRIC and ADAPT.
97 15 10 C Not too fast.
97 15 11 P No. We want to listen carefully so we can tell our
good buddies about it.
97 15 13 C Roger.
97 15 16 P Okay, at minus 30 you will arm the squibs-up and at
minus 10 seconds. I go to the AUTO RETRO and I'll

retros, are we?
97 15 49 C No.
97 15 50 P No, we are too.
97 15 51 C They can still run -- I don't know whether they got
the load in or not. Did he say they had the load
in?
97 15 54 P Yes.
97 15 56 C TRS will fire them.
97 15 58 P TRS is working all right.
97 16 00 C Okay. He said that.
97 16 01 P I'll delay that a little bit. Ha! Ha!
97 16 04 C Yes. Delay it till about 5. How about that?
97 16 06 P Yes. Okay. I'll put that on at minus 5, and I'll
fire on the time -- on the count of zero. No delay
on that time.
97 16 16 C Nope.
97 16 18 P Put you to FREE here, and I'll watch with bated
breath as we fire our retro rockets.
97 16 26 C Yes. Don't forget to put me to FREE, because we
might not -- you know, it may not go.
97 16 33 P I've been putting you to FREE as a regular thing --
on all training. After retrofire monitor yaw, check
Comp Light-ON. We don't have that Platform-FREE.
Okay, I'll have that.
97 16 44 P Report to Guaymas numbers of retros, IVI readings,
estimated -- all you're going to have to do is report
the number and the attitude.
97 16 52 C Good.
97 16 56 P Okay. After retros, ES sensor-OFF. We have a RET
checklist to go through. Do you want me to go
through that now?
97 17 04 C Yes. Jettison Retro if you want to.
97 17 06 P Yes, the Retro Jettison ARM first. Jettison Retro.
Report Jettison retros to Guaymas. Retro Power-SAFE,
Retro Jet-SAFE, Retro Squibs-SAFE. FDR -- might as
well leave that on ATTITUDE.

97 17 38 C Yes.
97 17 40 P The FDI will be on LOW.
97 17 43 C Okay.
97 17 44 P The attitude control -- you going to use Rate Command
or Reentry Rate Command?
97 17 48 C Reentry Rate Command.
97 17 50 C Okay. We're coming up on 22 minutes.
97 17 54 P Okay, aline your platform.
97 17 58 C Ha! Ha! Look, we've driven the temperature down to
55 in here!
97 18 04 P Now we'll suddenly start swimming, huh?
97 18 08 P You read the times off, because you have a good hack
around that area.
97 18 22 C Next thing we do is at 13. Right?
97 18 25 P Right.
97 18 30 P Okay. And that should be at 16 43 01. 22+9 minutes.
97 18 44 C It looks like we're still right-side-up out there.
97 18 54 C Boy, I really smell that ammonia.
97 18 59 C Do you?
97 19 01 P No, I don't. Jim, let me tell you something.
97 19 08 C It has something to do with wetting your pants,
doesn't it?
97 19 11 C No, this is about the strongest I've ever smelled
it. We really screwed up when we went with this
padding here. I wonder if -- gee, look there at the

97 21 28 C Okay. We're at 18:30 minutes.
97 21 40 P And you give me a mark when you start the burn.
97 21 42 C Right.
97 21 46 C We'll probably get a countdown from the ground, too.
We'll have a multiplicity of countdowns.
97 21 53 P None of which will probably agree in some respects.

the gantry is going down.
