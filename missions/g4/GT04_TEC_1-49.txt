        00 43 53               P   Roger, stand by.    Here they come.
        O0 44 20              CC   Gemini 4, you can turn your radiator, --correction,
                                   your secondary pump off. Your evaporators are nor-
                                   mal. Your radiator looks good.
        00 44 27               P   Roger. Evaporators NORMAL, and secondary pump A OFF.

        O0 44 33              CC   Okay. Give me about l0 seconds on your Quantity

        00 44 37               P   Roger.   Coming on.
        OO 44 39              CC   Roger.
        O0 44 50              CC   I'm standing by for your battery readouts.
        O0 44 59              CC   While you're doing that, can the Command Pilot give
                                   me a little information on the booster, the distance,
                                   what you have to do to get that close to see it, and
                                   how's the light working?

        O0 45 07               C   Roger. The light's working fine. I can't tell ex-
                                   actly how far it is though, I guess I'm probably a
                                   half a mile or so. The booster started tumbling
                                   right after we came off of it. I tried to dump the
                                   rates down, and I got them down till it looked like
                                   one-quarter degree per second but as soon as we got
                                   off I got around to see it, it was tumbling.

00 45 25     CC       Okay.     How much AV did you use before                     y_u got there?

O0 45 28      C       I got about          30 ft/sec         showing     on my window      there.

00 45 32     CC       Okay.

O0 45 34      C       The booster fell away quite rapidly and got below
                      us like there was _ considerable difference in our
                      velocity,       and I let the thing                get too far from        me.

O0 45 44     CC       All right.  Can you give me the battery readout?
                      If they look good I can give you a GO for 3-4.
                      .... and we're standing by for a blood pressure from
                      the Pilot.

O0 46 40      C       Carnarvon,           this   is Gemini        4.      I see lights     of a town
                      below me.

00 46 44     CC       Okay.     3,2,1-

O0 46 48     CC       MARK:

O0 46 52     CC       Did you get that time hack?

O0 46 55      P       Roger,    got that time hack,                 and am standing        by    for the

O0 47 16      P       Roger.         I'm getting           24 on all my adapter         batteries.

00 47 19     CC       Okay.         Your    readings        are good.

O0 47 32     CC       And I'm giving              you a new load.

O0 47 55      p       We got the update                  coming    in.

 O0 47 37    CC       Okay, I've got the load ready, you got the new TR
                      time.   We're standing by for that Pilot's blood
                      pressure.    You ready to copy youm update time?

 OO 47 42         P   Roger,        I copy the update              time,    ... the blood       pressure.

                      Over.
O0 47 54      P   Roger.  We're coming up on the booster now, and you
                  can see the daylight starting to break.     The lights
                  are quite visible, and I estimate that we're probably
                  in the _ricinity of three-quarters   of a mile from the
                  booster at the time now.    The lights are very easy
                  to see, and the horizon is quite easily defined at
                  this time.   We've unstowed the Contarex, the }Tassel-
                  blad, the 16-mm and the blood pressure cuff.     We're
                  both finding that there is not as much velcro as we'd
                  like to have in the spacecraft.    We feel like we need
                  more storage of loose items.    Same thing that John
                  and Gus found.

OO 49 O1      C   This is Jim here.  And I'm having a lot of difficulty
                  telling how far out I am from the booster.   I can see
                  the two lights flash occasionally, and that's the
                  only thing that tells me where I am at all - as far'
                  as distance with respect to the booster.   I didn't
                  get the time to aline my platform well before I went
                  into ...

OO 49 12      P   Roger.   Understand,  I read you.                  l:      170.     3+40.

O0 49 3©      C   Roger.      We're    GO.     Everything       looks      great.

O0 49 32     CC   Roger, that's        affirmative.           Your    orbit    is about       86.8
                  by 150.6.

O0   49 37    C   Roger.      Stand by.        They're    coming.
O0 49 38     P    Roger.     86.8       by 150.6.     Sounds        good.

O0 49 42    CC    Roger.     We need        that blood      pressure        on the Pilot.

O0 49 44     P    Roger,     that will be coming            up next.

O0 49 50     P    You'll     have       to stand by    for the accelerometer             bias.

O0 49 52     P    Hand me the           ... book,   will     you,    Jim?

00 49 54     C    The data book.

O0 49 55     P    Yes.      I just       can't    keep the booster          in sight    and    ...

O0 49 38    CC    Okay.      You    can give       it to Guaymas.

00 50 O0     C    I'm afraid        you'll       have to wait       for another    orbit       or
                  two.

00 50 O1    CC    All righty.

O0 50 06     C    Your     light    is on in case you're             going    to read    it.

O0 51 O1     p    Why don't        you do that,       Jim?

O0 51 02     C    Roger.   The light's working fine.  I can't tell
                  exactly how far up I am from it.   I guess I am
                  probably around a half a mile or so.   The booster
                  started tumbling as we came off of it.    I started
                  to damp the rates down_ and I got them down to what
                   looked like a quarter degree per second, but as
                   soon as we came off and I got around to see it, it
                   was tumbling.

O0 91 25   C    I've got about 30 ft/sec showing on my windows here.
                The booster fell away quite rapidly and got below us
                like there was a considerable  difference in our ve-
                locities_    and I've been struggling           here   to not let
                the thing    get too far from me.

O1 ll 27   CC   Standing    by.

O1 14 25    P   It has a pretty       good tumble       rate.   I'll try to time
                it here.
O1 14 37    P    Makes about one complete revolution in about 8 sec-
                 onds.   It's tumbling end over end. It looks like
                 now we're out a little further than we were before.
                 We've slipped out a little bit.    I'd estimate            it's
                 out about a mile and a half or maybe a little              more.
                 It was really quite a view when we first saw              it
                 down there.   It looked like almost one of the             artist's
                 conceptions,       lc was so vividly     clear.

01 20 58    P    Right now, we're in nose-to-the-ground   type attitude,
                 such that I don't believe the ground stations are
                 able to read us. We have heard several calls cut in
                 and out for us. We're going to stay in this attitude
                 though for a while to keep the booster in sight.     It
                 doesn't appear that we're making too much l_rogress
                 in closing with the booster right now.    It looks like
                 it's staying out about the same distance as it was
                 before.   During the night sight when the booster was
                 below us, it appeared that there was -1most a sky
                 full of stars.   There was so much of the venting
                 coming off the booster and into the sky.    In fact,
                 I commented on it that they looked like they were
                 stars.   When you look closely at the booster at that
                 time, you could see the fuel -- actually the white
                 vapors coming out of the aft end of the booster, and
                 I guess that was spreading the little fireflies all
                 around.   It was to such an extent though, it covered
                 the whole visible area in front of us.

O1 27 57     P   Hello,   Guay_s.      This   is Gemini   4.

O1 27 59    CC   Gemini   4, Guaymas    CAP COM.
O1 28 OO     _   R_ger, Guaymas.  We still have the booster.  We're
                 out quite a ways from it now, and it's taking a little
                 more fuel than we had anticipated.  We've got 61 in
                 the fore and aft window in the aft direction, 37 left
                 and 36 up at the present time.  We appear right now
                 to be just about holding our own with it.  Of course,
                 we should as we progress here.  We should start to
                 close with it_ but it's out further than we had hoped
                 to let it get right now.

O1 28 24    CC   Roger,   I copy.

O1 2P_ 25    C   Is there any way of giving me a quick             check   on what
                 my orbit is? This thing is way below              me.

O1 28 31    CC   Say again.

01 28 32     C   I said the booster is way below me.  Could                       )_u tell
                 me my present orbit?  As soon as possible.

01 28 43    CC   Roger,    we're     working     on it.

01 28 50    CC   Gemini 4, we'll update you with the orbit calcula-
                 tions some time after the pass over the States.

O1 28 56     P   Roger, I understand.   And           be advised our cabin pres-
                 sure seems to be holding            Just a hair below 5.   It
                 stabilized down initially            at 5.5_ decreased  _o 5-25,
                 and then went back up to            5.5, and it's now dowu a
                 little below 5.

O1 29 15    CC   Roger.     We copy.

01 29 16     P   All right, you might            get a confirmation          for me      on
                 that on the ground.

01 29 18    CC   Roger.      We're working        on it.        Put your    Quantity     Read
                 Switch     to READ.

01 29 23     P   Roger.      It's going        to READ.

01 29 54     C   Guaymas, this is Gemini 4. We're going to have to
                 get a resolution right away whether you want me to
                 really make a major effort to close this last thing
                 or to save fuel.

O1 29 44     C   Guaymas,     do you read        Gemini    4?
01 29 46    CC   Roger, we copy.   We suggest              you    stand by.        We want
                 to save the fuel.

O1 29 51     C   Okay.      I guess    it probably        expended       about    100 ft/seq.

O1 29 56    ?C   You expended        t00 ft/sec?

O1 30 O1     C   Yes,     that's   just a rough      guess.

                 to save the fuel.          You'll be advised over the Cape.

O1 31 O1     C   Well_ I Just can't wait till I get to the Cape.   I
                 guess we're Just going to have to watch it go away.
                 I've retrograded enough to help bring me down but I
                 don't want to get down to wherever it's going.

                as you can?

01 33 0h   CC   Jim, we've estimated you've used about                    50 percent
                of your 0A_  capability at this time.

01 33 l0    C   Roger.  I think we ought to knock it off, Gus.   It
                keeps falling, it's probably three or four miles
                away, and we Just can't close on it.

01 33 16   CC   Right, knock       off.     No more rendezvous          with    the
                booster.

O1 53 20    C   Okay.     Roger.

                we get to Canary.

01 33 34    C   Okay.

01 33 36   CC   Okay.  I want to give you your 5-1, 3-4,                    4-4 times
                so tell me when you're ready to copy.

                     I'm afraid that our attitudes were not so that we
                     could read with good reception on those stations.

                    planned.  That's BEF and 180 ° in roll.  That should

          02 03 45        P   At this time we are passing over quite a series of
                              thunderstorm cells, off at our ... Can you see it
                              out there? ... it should be about your i o 'clock
                              .°.e.



           02 04 37       C   No,     I can't   see it,      Maybe      .....

           02 04 46       P   Oh, those must be fireflies               again'   Are you in the
                              light over there?

           02 04 50       C   Yes,     I'm in the light.

           02 04 51       P   How does       that happen?      I'm in night       over here.

           02 04 55       C   We're    going    sideways.

           02 04 57       C   Act,,al ly, we're     going    around       to blunt-end-forward.

           02 05 00       P   _]1 right.   A very interesting thing -- Jim's got full
                              daylight out his window, and I have full night out
                              of mine.   We're grad_,ally yawing around to blunt-end-
                              forward, mnd it looks like the reflection of the sun
                              on these fireflies causes them to glow very brightly.
                              That was the type of stars that we saw on our first
                              dark side.

           02 05 29       P   It seems very strange for me to look out Jim's side
                              and see daylight and look out my side and it's just
                              pitch black.

           02 07 59       P   We've got       an object out in front of us.    It's not
                              flashing       like it 's the booster.  It appears that it 's
                              that type       of an object unless it's picking up some
                              glow from       the sun.   It appears a very bright, bright
                              object.

02 _   3©    P   We st_ll have the booster at ... it was the booster.
                 I c_n see the lights flashing _:_ it now. it's just
                 passing on the horizon.  Just as it goes               to darkness,
                 the reflection of the sun on the booster               causes a
                 very bright image.          That's the object I had seen
                 earlier.   It seems        like we're still in fair close
                 proximity of the booster,   it looks like              it's out
                 in the neighborhood  of 2 or 3 miles.

02 51 36      C   Stand by one.

02 51 39      C   C'-_y, go ahead      Hawaii.

02 51 41     CC   Roger.  Flight advises go back on normal suit cir-
                  cuit until next rev. Then go back over Carnarvon.

02 51 50      C   Roger.  That's       what we're           doing    right    now.     We   just
                  couldn't quite       hack it.

02 54 26       CC   Be advised      you'll probably bring up your computer
                    over Texas      and they will give you a 4-4 load.

02 54 53        C   Okay.    Very    good.

02 54 55       CC   That's   all we have       for you.

02 54 37        C   Thank you.       We'll   talk to you in about      an hour    and
                    a half.

02 54 41       CC   Roger.    Hawaii    out.

02 57 05        C   Jim McDivitt.  Right now it's about T* 3 hours.
                    When we came off the booster at SECO, we had rates
                    of around half a degree a second.    I tried to damp
                    them out and finally came off around SECO + 30 sec-
                    onds.   It seemed that as we came off we might have
                    come off with some other rates.   What do you think,
                    Ed?

02 57 36        P   Yes, we did.  I wasn't watching           as we   came   off, but
                    it felt like we did come off.

02 57 41        C   Yes, at spacecraft separation.  It seems to me we
                    came off with some rates, the direction of which
                    I couldn't really tell, but ...

02 57 48        P   Felt like    we went     this way to me.

02 57 51        C   Yes.

02 57 52        P   We didn't    get a linear      type   forward   separation.

02 57 56        C   Yes.

02 57 58        C   As we got turned around, we came right on around,
                    and found ourselves about 300 or 400 feet from the
                    booster.  I guess that was about right, wouldn't
                    you say?

02   .58 08     P   Yes.

02 58 lO        C   I thrusted toward the booster about 5 ft/see.    My
                    separation burn was around the neighborhood   of 6 or
                    7 seconds.   I thrusted at the booster for about
                    5 or 6 ft/sec and then watched it as we were sepa-
                    rating from it.    I thrusted about another 5 ft/sec.
                    Looked like we started closing --we started closing
                    from off to the side and at about 600 to 700 feet, I
                    guess.   If you think any of these numbers are wrong
                    just call out.

02   59   50    P   No.
                                                                          25


        02 Q9 53   C    And then it looked like all apparent motion had
                        stopped and we were probably closing. So I turned
                        the spacecraft around and made an attempt to aline
                        the platform. In the meantime.,the booster started
                        dropping down below us at a rather obvious rate.
                        So I gave up trying to aline the platform to line
                        up and thrust down toward the booster, and I retro-
                        fired slightly to slow down with it. Once again,
                        it looked like our rates were stopped. But by now
                        we had drifted out to about 1000 feet or so. We
                        then tracked the booster across Africa pointing
                        down at it all the way. We got in to sunset pretty
                        quick and at s_mset I guess we were at about
                        1200 feet, Ed?
        02 59 _9   CC   Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
        03 00 O0    P   Yes, we were in fairly close.
        03 00 02    C   We were at 1200 feet and closing slightly.

        03 O0 10    C   Go ahead, Houston.   Gemini 4.
        03 00 15    C   As we went into nighttime we were .....
        05 O0 17    C   Go ahead, Houston.   Gemini 4.
        03 00 19   CC   Roger. Jim, you're going to be live as you make
                        your pass across the States this time.
        (WatchTimed)
        03 00 24    C   Okay.   Anything in particular you wanted me to say? '
        03 00 31   CC   Suit yourself.
        O3 00 33    C   Okay.
        05 00 39   CC   Hey, Jim. Could you give me an idea of ho-_much
                        you --what was the ratio of your thruster use, how
                        much you used your aft firing, and how much you used
                        your forward firing thrusters back early in the
                        Flight Plan?
        03 O0 50    C   Yes. I'll give you percentage. I used the top
                        thrusters down for about l0 or 15 seconds, I guess.
                        I used the aft firing ones almost the entire time
                        aside from that.

        05 O1 13   CC   Roger. I copy. Ten or 15 seconds on the down, al-
                        most all the rest of it on the aft.

                                      that's about all.

      O 3 O1 29               C       I might add that we have seen the booster.  It con-
                                      tinues to circle around with us, but it's just too
                                      far off to go get.

      03 O1 33              CC        Roger.      Hey, would you check your                     ACQ aid         circuit
                                      breaker     and make sure it's ON.

      03 01 37                C       Make    sure that         it's OFF?

      03 O1 38              CC         It's ON.

      03 01 41                C       Okay.       It's OFF at this             time.      It's coming            back   ON.

      03 O1 44              CC        Okay.       It's coming          ON.

      03 02 13                C        Negative.   I don't             have     it ON.        Do you want         it ON
                                       at this time?

      03 02 15              CC         Roger.      Turn       it ON.     We're        going    to give you a 4-4

      03 02 18                C        Okay.  I thought we were going                     to get         it later.
                                       I'll turn it ON at this time.

          03 03 08                C    Yes, Gus.   It would have been a short                            flight      if we'd
                                       kept chasing that mother around.

                                              and when we finally called it                                  quits it was obvious
                                              that we weren't going to make                                  it at that time with-

                                              and we're Just about all set to go.   I think when we
                                              get about over Africa we're going to go through the
                                              checklist again, and when we get to Carnarvon we'll
                                              be all set.

03 07 19   CC   Roger, I lost you there for a minute.   Say, you
                never did start to decompress, did you?

03 07 22    C   Say again.

03 07 24   CC   Did you ever       start    decompressing?

03 07 26    C   Negative.        We never       started    decompressing.

03 07 28   CC   Roger,   understand.

03 08 10    C   Frankly, we haven't             really    had time to look             out too

                with it all through the darkness .....

03 08 51   CC   You're   getting     awi_lly       garbled.

03 08 33    C   Roger.   I say again.  We            saw it when we were in the
                darkness, but we haven't             seen it since we came back
                out into the light.

03 09 53     C       Negative.

03 l0 04    CC       Hey, Jim, we figure the booster ought to be about
                     32 miles ahead of you and 5 miles below you at this
                     time.

03 l0 l0     C       Thirty-two       ahead    and 5 below.

03 l0 29     P       We've got quite a good view of the whole                        state    of
                     Florida, and we're passing over it now.

03 10 34    CC        You've    got Florida      in sight,      huh?

03 l0 35     p       _te can see it from the top to the bottom.

03 l0 39    CC       Very     good.

03 10 43     P        In fact, we're lookfng            right down at the Cape               now.
                      You can see the launch            complexes down there.                It's
                      quite clear.

03 I1 06    CC        Hey,    Jim.    Gemini    4.

03 Il 14    CC        We'd like for you to turn your cabin heat exchanger
                      ON until you get ready to decompress.  And the fan.

03 11 20     C        Roger.      We're not getting           hot if that's       what   you're.

03 15 56   CC   Hey, your cabin temperature  came down               l0° since

03 16 34   CC   As you cone over Ascension I want to try to give you
                a check there.   The air-ground  remote hasn't worked
                too wel'i today but we sure would like to get that
                one up.

03 16 41    C   Roger, we'll     be waiting.

03 16 44   CC   Roger.

03 16 45    C   Would Mou advise,      we've     both    had a drink,    and     I had

03 16 51   CC   Roger.

03 27 42    P   We've got another sighting on the booster.  It looks
                like it's Just about horizontal with us and right
                straight out in front of ut.

03 27 48    C   Sm_l]-end-forward.

03 27 49    P   We are going small-end-forward             and it looks        like   it's
                very close to our orbit.

03 27 58    C   And it's at about       3:28 elapsed       time.

03 29 48    P   The lights on the booster          are still       blinking.      I can
                see them at this time.

03 34 00    C   We're just at 3+24 right now.    Just going into dark-
                ness.   The sunlight has been shining on the nose of
                the spacecraft with small-end-forward,    just about.
                Actually, we're 300 left of being straight ahead,
                sma1 ]-end-forward.   And the way the sun was shining
                on the edge of the booster .... spacecraft was
                causing a reflection,   just like someone had a mirror
                there and was shining it straight ahead.
                                                                    51


03 34 34    P   Yes, that's what ..... that last time, Jim.
03 34 41    C   A bunch of thunderstorms out on the horizon.
03 34 51    C   Okay. We get to Carnarvon at 3:58. That's when
                we're going to get our GO. We start our depres-
                surization right there. What we're going to do is
                that we're going to open the Repress, tighten your
                helmet, .....
05 55 17    P   We've got one thing left to do in the steps.     We've
                got to take these off, Jim.
03 35 20    C   Take what off?
05 35 P_l   P   The suit pressure lines and put them on the inter-
                connect.

03 55 25    C   Yes, that's not yet though .....
03 35 28    P   Do you have the interconnect over there handy?
03 35 R9    C   Yes, I've got it right here.
05 35 50    P   Okay.
05 55 51    C   This is in the egress.
03 35 51    P   A]I right.
03 35 32    C   When we start at Carnarvon.
03 35 34    C   Open the Repress Valve. Okay, this is what we're
                going to do. Helmet tied on?
03 55 38    P   Yes.
03 55 40    C   Right Suit Flow Control OFF?
05 35 45    P   Right.
03 35 46    C   Disconnect inlet and outlet ECS hoses.   Remove your
                interconnect.

03 36 14    C   0kay_ let's see. Remove the interconnect. Inter-
                connect the two ECS hoses ... by your elbow.
03 56 24    P   Okay.

03 36 37   C   Check    the emergency       FLOW    and then back      to CLOSED.

03 36 38   P   Roger.

03 36 40   C   Recheck    your    suit,    your pack,      and tether.

03 36 42   P   Roger.

03 36 43   C   Recheck your face-plate  closed and locked.  Helmet
               locked, gloves on, inlet-outlet  "Y", and ECS hoses
               free.  And then I'll have a Command Pilot Suit Check,
               which I've already done ..... on to check the flow.
               Hatch lock OPEN.   Then you've got your other things
               to check.  When we actm,Ally start the Depressuriza-
               tion Mode, Cabin Vent valve go to 2 psi, then we
               close the vent valve.   Then we install both blood
               pressure pump plugs, which I don't seem to be able
               to find.

03 38 09   C   Gee,    I don't even       have    one on mY suit.

03 38 07   P   I don't    have    one eitherl       Jim.

03 38 l_   C   Swell.

03 38 18   P   Aw, baloney.

03 38 23   P   I sure don't       see one.

03 38 30   C   Nope,    I don't    have    one.

03 38 31   P   I don't    either,    ,,nless it's up under           mY cover.
03 58 42   C   No, you don't       have    one, Ed.'

03 38 4_   P   The hole's    not big       enough    but still   you ought       to
               have one.

03 38 50   C   Right.

03 39 O0   P   Neither of our suits          have the blood      pressure    cuff     -
               blood pressure plug

03 39 07   P   And we just had a very             pretty   moonset.

03 39 O0   C   Just a cas,,-1 con_ent here.  We looked out and
               thought we saw the horizon.   It turned out, it was
               obviously air glow.   We could see the stars well be-
               low its edge.

05 49 l0   C   We'll talk about       this       some more   later    when we get
               more time.
                                                                                                             33


     03 50 07     P    We noticed the old familiar pulsing in the suits
                       when we had the RECIRC closed all the way down and
                       our dampers that time were open full in both suits.
                       It was the same type of a pulsation that occurred
                       in altitude chamber and which was, I believe, du_
                       plicated in the testing.

     02 90 33     P    Cabin pressure seems to hold around 4.8 to 9.0,
                       right on the bottom.  Also, our Left Secondary Oxy-
                       gen is pretty high, looks like it's up around 5400.
                       Been that way ever since we started.

04 34 15     C       Make that        flag look pretty.

04 34 19     P       Yes.

04 34 21     P       Okay.     I'm right by the stub antenna                now.

04 34 24    CC       Gemini    4, keep talking.            It's working.

04 34 24     C       Okay.  Let me get some ..... to you, Ed.  I ought

04 34 30    CC       Gemini    4, Houston       CAP COM.

04 34 31     P       Okay.      I think      I've exhausted        my air now.

04 34 33     C       Okay.

04 34 36     C       Stay     right there.

04 34 40     p       I had very good          control     with    it.    I just needed
                     more air.

 04 34 45    C       Okay.   Stand by.          Let me take a couple          of pictures,
                     ole buddy.

 04 34 48    p       All     right.
 04 34 52   CC       Gemini     4, Houston          CAP COM.

 04 34 58   CC       Tell him to keep talking.                  We're   receiving   Ed
                     through your VOX.
0_ 3_ O0   P    Ara you reading       me, CAP COM?

Oh 3_ O1   P    ..... Gus?

04 35 02   C    Okay.     We're   going    to VOX now.

04 35 04   C    Okay,    Ed.   They're     receiving       you.

04 35 07   P    Okay.

04 35 09   C    Tell    them   what you think.

04 35 10   P    That's right, CAP COM, it's very easy to maneuver
                with the gun.  The only problem I have is that I
                haven't got enough fuel.   I've exhausted the fuel
                now and I was able to maneuver myself around the
                front of the spaeecraft_  back_ and maneuver right
                up to the top of the adapter.   Just about .....
                came back into Jim's view.   The only thing I wish
                is that I had more.   This is the greatest experi-
                ence I've ..... it's just tremendous!    Right now
                I'm standing on my head, and I'm looking right down,
                and it looks like we're coming up on the coast of
                California.   I'm going into a slow rotation to the
                right.   There is absolutely no disorientation as-
                sociated with it.

04 35 _2   C    One _hing about it, when Ed gets out there and
                starts wiggling around_ it sure .makes the space-
                craft tough to control.

04 36 02    P   I feel    just about      like   a .....     _:ormmercial.

04 36 03   CC   Is he taking      pictures?

04 36 11   CC   Take    some   pictures.

04 36 12    P   Okay.     I'm going      to work     on getting      some pictures,
                Jim.

04 36 14    C   Okay.     Get out in front         where    I can see you again.

04 36 16    P   Yes.

04 36 18    C   I've    only got about       three    on the Hasselblad.

04 36 20    P   Okay.

04 36 22    C   W%ere    are you?

04 36 24    P   Right out in front now.   I don't                 have the control
                I had any more withou,t that gun.

04 36 28    C   Yes,    I noticed   that.

04 36 31    p   On the tether.

04 36 31   CC   You've    got about       _ minutes.
