04 36 33   P   But I want to get out and shoot some good pictures.
               i'm not satisfied with that.     Okay, i'm drifting
               down underneath  the spacecraft.

04 36 40   C   Okay.    I'm going    to start   firing    the nhrusters      now.

04 36 45   P   Ail right.    There's no difficulty   in recontacting
               the spacecraft.     It's all very soft, particularly
               as long as you move nice and slow.      I'm very thank-
               ful to have the experience.      It's great_ Gus.   Right
               now I'm right on top of the spacecraft - just above
               Jim's window.     I'll bring myself in and put myself
               out into your view, Jim.

04 37 09   C   Okay.    Hold   it and I'll take your       picture.

04 37 24   P   Right now I could maneuver much better if I didn't
               have the gun with the camera on it, because I have
               to tie one hand up with it.

04 37 31   C   Okay.    Stay right    there   if you can.

04 37 47   C   Okay, do you want      me to maneuver      for you now,    Ed?
04 37 50   P   No, I think you're doing fine.  What I'd like to do
               is get all the way out, Jim, and get a picture of
               the whole spacecraft.   I don't seem to be doing
               that.

04 38 00   C   Yes_ I noticed    that.      You can't    seem to get   far
               enough away.

04 38 02   P   No.

04 38 O_   C   Where   are you now?      Am I clear     to thrust   a little
               bit?

04 38 07   P   No, don't   thrust    now.

04 38 12   C   Okay.   Ed, just free-float around. Right now we're
               pointing just about straight down at the ground.

04 38 14   P   Okay, now I'm taking a look back at the adapter and
               equipment back there.    Z can see the separation
               plane; it's quite clean.    The thrusters are clean.
               The thermal paint, the thermal stripping looks quite
               good.   A_lso_ the velcro that we put on seems to be
               in good shape right by the camera.     I'm coming back
               down on the spacecraft.    I can sit up here and see
               the whole California coast.

04 38 58   P   Okay.  Now I'm going to go out and aec how much               .....
               if I've got enough harness.

04 39 26   P   The sky sure    is black.

                     right now?

 04 39 37        P   No.

 04 39 38        C   Aw,    shoot!

 04 39 41        P   Let me work on back.   Listen, it's all the differ-
                     ence in the world with this gun.    _,en that gun was
                     working, I was maneuvering   all around.

 04 39 50        C   .....

 04 39 52        P   Yes.       Okay.
    04 40 20     P   ..... contacted.

    04 40 22_    C   Yes.

    04 40 24     P   How are you doing           old buddy?

    04 40 26     C   Pretty      good.       How about     you?

    04 40 28     P   Good.       Looking      right    in your window.

    04 40 31     C   Where?       You're      not even     there.     Are you there,        Ed?

    04 40 32     P   No, I'm moving           out now.

    04 40 34     C   Let    me take a picture.

    04 40 53     P   Okay,      there    I go.       No.   Boy, I s_e     could     use that
                     guJ,.

    04 40 53     C   A pretty      neat      little    contraption_     h_uh?

    04 40 _5     P   Yes.  Ali the strings that are ati_ched                     to me tend
                     to dampen out my travel on the lanyard.

    04 41 09     C   Yes,      I noticed      that.

    04 41 l0    CC   You'_      got 4 minutes          and 30 seconds     left.

    04 41 l0     P   Okay, I'm going to free drift a little bit,                       and see
                     if I can drift into some good picture-taking                       posi-
                     tion.

    04 41 16     C   Okay.      Here_       let me    control     the spacecraft       .....

    04 41 33     C   Just for your           information    Ed_ we're     only     down to
                     48 percent         on our 02 .

    04 41 38     P   Okay.

 04 41 40        C   ECS 02 pressure           is about    830 , so it's staying          right
                     up there.

              04 41 45         P    You know one thing about             this.  'Where we have this
                                    tether attached,  I can't            get a good push off.

              04 41 52         C    Oh yes, is that right?              Where it's attached            to you
                                    or where it's attached             to the spacecraft?

              04 42 OO          P   Where it's attached to the spacecraft.   There's
                                    nothing particularly  to get a push off on.   Now,
                                    let's see if I can get a decent push off.    If I
                                    didn't have the gun I could do a little better.
                                    There just isn't anything to push on.

               04 42 19         C   Ed, smile.
               04 42 26         P   I'm looking        right   down    your gun barrel.         A1 right.

               04 42 28         C   Let me take       a closeup       picture   of you.

               04 42 30         P   Okay.     Just a m_nute.

               04 42 31         C   You    smeared    up my windshield,         you dirty       dogl

               04 42 34         P   Did    I really?

               04 42 35         C   Yes.

               04 42 37         P   Well,    hand    me out a kleenex       and    I'll clean      it.
               04 42 40         C   Ha!     See how it's all          smeared   up there?

               04 42 44         P   Yes.

               04 42 45         C   It looks like there is a coating                on the outside         and
                                    you've rubbed it off.

               04 42 47         P   Yes.

               04 42 50         C   That's    exactly     what you've      done.

               04 42 53         P   Okay.

               04 42 55         C   Okay.   Right now, the spacecraft rates are up about
                                    i deg/sec in pitch and yaw, and about 1/2 deg/sec
                                    in roll.

05 20 57    P   Yes,    I did that       just after we got in orbit.

05 21 08    C   I tell you.   The day side just               isn't      long    enough
                for EVA.   You know that?

                You still want to take them off?

05 22 43    P   I don't know.        I could      take them off and stick               them
                above my feet.

05 22 47    C   We'll    worry   about    that later.        That's      not .....

05 25 33     C   Yes.  Okay.  Why don't we go ahead                          and do that?
                 That might be a good idea.

05 25 35     P   Yes,   I think       it is.       I{F antenna's             coming    out.

       05 38 19      C       I really can't tell.    It looks like it is about
                             5 or 6 miles perpendicular   to our Flight Plan.
                             Maybe it's more than that.     It could be as far out
                             as 20 miles perpendicular   to it.

       05 58 32    CC        Roger-.    Is your Adapter          C-band    in COMMAND       now?

06 15 20                   C   Roger, will           do.

06 15 22                  CC   Okay, I'm reading you now.    I have an onboard map
                               update for you.   _he ascending node is 132° East.
                               G.m.t. of the node is 21 39 00.

06 15 39                   C   Roger.         Say again       the longitude    of the ascending
                               node.

06 15 45                  CC   Roger.         It's    152° East.

06 15 50                   C   Roger.         132° East and 21 39 00.

06 15 55                  CC   That's        affirmative       and would    you put your      ECS 02

06 14 05                   C   Which        ECS 02 switch       to OFF?.

06 14 l0                  CC   All right, that's the heater switch.  Your waste

06 1% OO     S          Okay.   Ed,         we understand that you d_ not have                tile
                        exerciser          out, so would you go ahead and pump                up
                        the cuff,          and we'll do without the exerciser.
                        We'll get          a single blood pressure.

06 1_ 41     S          Ed, we don't          see any cuff response          yet.

06 15 h6     P          I pumped       it all the way up.

06 15 49     S          Does    it feel       firm to you?

06 15 91     P          Yes,    quite       firm.    I'$ .....

06 lQ 56     S          Okay,    let her bleed,           Ed.

06 1_ _9     P          Roger, and we'll pass it on to you now.  I've had
                        about 12 swallows of water and I think Jim probably
                        had 10.   Also, we haven't              eaten    anything     yet and
                        we' re awfully hungry.

06 16 16     S          Real    great.  Listen Ed, we want to modify the Flight
                        Plan    and we would like to have the sleep period
                        changed here and let you get some rest.   We'd like
                        to have you go for at least 4 hours right now and
                        it's perfectly agreeable with Chris if we go ahead
                        and have Jim sleep some of this period, too if he
                        gets sleepy during that period.   It's agreeable
                        to Chris.

06 16 45     P          Understand          you'd   like me to go to sleep           for a little
                        while.

06 16 49     S          Roger.  We'd like for you to go to sleep.                       For
                        4 hours, anyway.

06 %6 54     P          I'm not too sleepy;               however,    I'll .....

06 16 59     S          Okay_ let's give it a try.   Could I confirm one
                        thing with you too, Ed? When you were EVA, we got
                        a transmission that there was no disorientation,
                        and that was affirmative  for the entire time.   Is
                        that correct?

06 17 14    P   _ere  was ne disorientaticn  whats _v_r.    I felt
                that I c_uld either look d_n    at the _rLound -- I
                felt perfectly at home looking d, wn at it - and I
                could roll around on _   back and look up and it was
                not disorienting  me in any way.   The spacecraft was
                my best reference.   Any time I saw it I immediately
                had a good reference and_ in fact at times near the
                end I was using my tether and actually walking up
                and down on the surface of the spacecraft,    using it
                to hold me down, as somewhat of an anchor.

06 17 48    S   Oh, that     sounds       terrific.        Wonderful.

06 17 52    P   There     just    isn't any disorientation              whatsoever.

06 17 _3    S   Let's go on that sleep period.  If Jim has no argu-
                ments about that, that's the end of the transmission
                here then.

06 18 43   CC   Roger.

06 18 44    C   Just what the plan is now with the fuel                     remaining,
                or how are we going to handle the fuel?

06 18 52   CC   As best as I can tell you right now, you'll be able
                to accomplish practically  all of the Flight Plan
                with the fuel that you have remaining at this time.
                We'll keep updating you in real time.   Right now
                we want you to get some sleep.   As far as your
                Apollo D-9 goes, it looks like you're going to be
                too far from the booster.

06 19 10    C   Okay, if Ed sleeps, and if I see it, I'll                     go ahead
                and use the sextant.

06 19 15   CC   Right.   If you do see it, you might unstow the
                sextant, but I wouldn't recommend you unstow it
                before you see it because it looks like you are
                going to be plenty far from it.

06 19 22    C   Okay; now I saw it on the last orbit                    so maybe   I'll
                see it on the next one.

                                         to see whether we can really do any                            of these OAMS
                                         retros.  For instance 6-4, we didn't                            have enough
                                         fuel so there wouldn't have been any                            argument.

             06 19 58            C       Okay, I'll go ahead and proceed with the Flight
                                         Plan as we've got it now.  Is that correct?

               I tried station-keeping   with it, but the only thing
               I had to judge my distance from the booster at that
               time was the distance between the flashing lights.
               Occasionally they would - not occasionally,    but
               continually, I would see one light, then two lights,
               and then one light, and then sometimes there'd be
               a long time before I'd see two lights -- indicating
               that the booster was rotating all the time.      I
               really didn't have too much of a clue as to which
               way it was going.   Based on the distance between
               the lights, when I could see both of them, I felt
               that I was in a real good position with it until
               we got to about Carnarvon.    At that time I seemed
               to be closing rather rapidly, although I couldn't
               really be sure of this.    All the AV I'd added up
               to that time had been in the direction    of the
               booster, or retrograde.   Unfortunately,  the darned
               booster would get in position such that if I were
               going to close on it, I would have to apply a posi-
               grade to close, which then, in turn, caused me to
               once again depart from it after a period of time
               had gone by.   _hen with the 45 - 40 minutes of
               darkness, I really had a difficult time telling
               where I was.  As we came out of the darkness, the
               booster was below me and pulling sway From me quite
               rapidly.  Ed, how far away below us do you think it
               was?

06 43 O1   P   Oh, I don't know.  I'd estimate      it was    probably   out
               there a mile and a half or two.

06 43 06   C   Yes.

06 45 06   P   It's very difficult   to estimate    when    it gets   to be
               that far.

06 43 08   C   It certainly was.  I sort of felt that it was prob-
               ably between one and two miles, and I couldn't
               really tell how far out.
72



06 43 18     C   Definitely below me.   I'd been tracking it zel_
                 me from about Carnarvon on.   Up until a_out
                 Carnarvon we had it bel_   us, and then up t¢ th_
                 horizon, and then down t_elow us again.  It almost
                 looked like it was in a different orbit than I was.
                 It had a different apogee and perigee than what I
                 did.   Anyway, I attempted to close with it at day-
                 light as soon as I could tell where it was.       As I
                 said, at that time it was a mile or two out in
                 front of me -- down below me.    So, the more I tried
                 to close, the less I really gained on it.      I was
                 firing retrograde.   I was using my top thrusters
                 to fire in such a manner as to decrease my total
                 velocity, and then firing ..... at the same time.
                 I never really closed, and it continued to pull
                 away from me.   It became obvious to me that by the
                 time we got to Hawaii that to close on the booster
                 in time to do the EVA with the booster would prob-
                 ably take all the fuel we had onboard.      In the
                 ground rule we had agreed not to do this.      So I
                 checked with CAP COM and we decided to not go ahead
                 with the booster portion of the mission.      I don't
                 know if I mentioned it, but when we separated from
                 the booster, it seemed llke our rates on the booster
                 were iow, on the order of a half a degree a second
                 in pitch and yaw.   I tried to damp these.     I fired
                 one impulse in each direction, and then I concen-
                 trated on coming off the booster.     We came off, and
                 we came off in the manner in which we generated
                 some other rates.   We came right-side-up,    eventually,
                 and turned around.   Probably about a minute and a
                 half or two minutes.    It looked like the big problem
                 was the time I took out to semi-aline the platform
                 before we went into the dark side.     We'd probably
                 gotten right on top of the booster instantaneously.
                 If I'd ignored the platform we would have been able
                 to go ahead and complete it.     On the other hand, I
                 wanted to make sure we had a reasonably good aline-
                 ment prior to getting to our 2-1 GO-NO GO point in
                 case anything went wrong.
06 46 04     C   What's   that?   Gum?

06 46   06   P   Yes.
                                                                                                          7_




06 46 08    C            As the booster departed us, you could see the fuel
                         spraying out of the roll nozzle.     As the booster
                         tumbled around, mostly in a plane that would be
                         perpendicular  to a line through the major axis of
                         the spacecraft to the booster, you could see the
                         long flowing tail that came out of it. I'm going
                         to draw m short little picture of that on my flight
                         plan.   There was debris all over at spacecraft
                         separation.   We turned around and there were things
                         all over the place.    As a matter of fact, until we
                         really got a good look at the booster, I really
                         couldn't tell what was what.     Fairings came off
                         right at fairing jet with no problem.     The horizon
                         scanner fairings looked like them came off intact
                         but I couldn't really tell because it disappeared
                         out of sight so last.    I didn't see the nose fair-
                         ing come off at all.

06 4 7 36   C            I never did get an accelerometer   bias to check on
                         the platform.   I was thrusting most of the time
                         there, and unable to really settle the thing down
                         fcr any length of time.   We skipped a couple tape
                         dumps I guess, because of the peculiar attitude
                         that we were in.   I could not contact Carnarvon
                         very well on the first pass.    It's a shame we
                         didn't have a camera out right when we separated
                         because .....

06 48 33    P            Boy!          That was beautiful.

06 48 40    C            Nice.         What?     g?
06 48 42    P            Nc.          That first      view    of that booster.

06 48 45    C            Oh yes.          That was      really       nice, wasn't   it?
06 48 45    P            That was beautiful.

06 48 46    C            _at       was    really      nice all right.

06 48 50    C            Just the way it should have been.

06 48 51    P            Just exactly!

06 48 52    C            How far out do you think we were when we first
                         saw it?  I think we must have been at least
                         500 feet out when we first got around.

06 48 57    P            Oh, we were           closer    than that.

06 48 58    C            Do you think           so?

06 48 59    P            Oh yes.          I'd say we were            in the neighborhood          of .....

06 1,9 04   C   It's 130 feet long - the wh<!e thin_, I mean.                   Just
                as a reference, from tke pad t¢ cur spacecraft                  was

06 a9 13    P   Yes.

06 49 14    C   Okay.

06 49 18    P   I'd estimate       we were    out about     a littie     over
                200 feet.

06 49 20    C   Think    so?

06 49 21    P   Yes.

06 49 22    C   Okay,    I wculd    estimate     .....

06 49 22    P   Boy,    it w_s    sitting    right   out there!

06 49 23    C   ..... between five and six hundred feet, but
                certainly close enough where you could see it in
                all its clarity.

06 49 28    P   Going away       and the tumbling        was starting.

06 49 30    C   Right.   It didn't      take     long for that      tumbling    to
                get going.

06 49 35    P   Interesting  thing, though.   The tumbling, really,
                as I could see, never appreciably     picked up. It
                stayed there.    It star%ed out .....

06 49 42    C   You     know what    it looked       like to me?
06 49 44    P   What?

06 49 45    C   It looked like it was tumbling in an oscillatory
                manner.  It would tumble for a while and then it
                looked like, as it burped or the fuel came                  out or
                something, it would change its orientation                  and
                pull over in another way.

06 49 56    P   Yes, but it never           seemed to go    .....   I timed
                them ..... looked           like .....

06 49 59    C   The rates ..... Yes, the total rate never really
                seemed to pick up good in whatever  it was.  What
                was it?   Eight seconds/rev?

06 50 O5    P   Eight    seconds/revolution.           I timed   them.

06 50 06    C   Okay.     Let me write        that down    so we don't     forget    it.

06 50 l0    C   Starting over the   United States, actually Ed started
                unstowing things just as soon as we got into orbit.
                I thir_ that we could unstowwithout     jeopardizing
                the p_-s_ibility of a safe 2-1 reentry.
06   51   O1   P   _at's         that       dc_n    there     below    us?     Over     the_'e.

06   _1   06   C   Looks        lik_    a    city    er     something.

06   51   11   P   Are     we    upside-down?

06   _1   1_   C   I think        we're       pointing        right    dc_n    at    the    ground.

06   51   18   C   Ed    started        on    unstowing        stuff     and   as    soon    as we    got
                   to the position    where  it became  no longer    feasable
                   to fool with the booster,     I started   full-time
                   helping   him - at least holding    the things   and stow-
                   in them away and trying     to keep  them from disappear-
                   ing.    The faster  we worked   the farther' behind    we
                   got.      Not because   we weren't   putting                       things   the way
                   they     were  supposed  to, it just took                        a lot longer
                   than     we had anticipated.      It really                      wasn't   much
                   easier   at zero g than  it was in the simulator,    if
                   as easy.    So we worked  all the way around.     By the
                   time we got to Carnarvon,    I had made up my mind
                   that we couldn't    make  it, but I thought     we'd  forge
                   on a little   longer.    By the time we got to - or
                   Just before   we even left Carnarvon      it was clear    to
                   me that we could    not ma _._=the depressurization.       I
                   called   for a slip to tL     next orbit.    We then .....
                   caught   our breath   for about 20 minutes     and tried   tc
                   sort out the junk I had laying       around  in the cock-
                   pit.    Then I got the checklist     out and we went
                   through   the checklist   again   in detail  to make   sure
                   that we hadn't    skipped    anything   in the rush.     Started
                   the extravehicular     -- got the     GO over Carnarvon.
                   We were  all set tD go and we were         standing  by for
                   the GO to start depressurizing.          We got it.    Went
                   through    the depressurizaticn        cycle.     As we left
                   Carnarvon,    we were    cleared    for the full EVA.       We
                   got to Canton      or Hawaii,    and at that time were
                   given -- I believe      it was Canton      or Hawaii   that gave
                   us the GO to actually        exit the spacecraft       and start
                   the extravehicular       maneuvers.      We accomplished      this
                   as indicated     on our tape recorder         that we recorded
                   before   and on the VOX position.           We went   ahead   and
                   Ed got out and we started         to take pictures       as we --
                   how we would ..... I initially        held the spacecraft
                   fixed   for him.     _hen as he got out and seemed          to be
                   floating    around   in such a manner       that I couldn't
                   track him-      initially,    we decided      that it was better
                   to let the thing drift.          Is that right?

06 54     25   P   That's       right.

                              tended to keep them below that level.     As he got
                              back into the spacecraft, we had a considerable
                              amount of difficulty with the hatch.     First we
                              lifted the ratchet portion of the hatch to engage.
                              After we got that engaged, we couldn't get the
                              hatch down closed far enough.    Actually, we started
                              pulling down on the locking handles to get the dogs
                              out.   So, we had a rather exciting time and I think
                              it was on tape, wasn't it Ed?    I had the tape re-

                              there sometime.   I don't know.

         06 55 26         C   Okay.  So it my         be on tape and it may not.  It went
                              on for -- I think       we were 44 minutes after we started
                              EVA.   I was looking at my event timer which I had
                              started when Ed exited the spacecraft.    At 44 min-
                              utes we still didn't have the hatch closed.    We were
                              t_jing to take things calm, cool, and collected so
                              we didn't get things all screwed up.   And finally,
                              by my pulling as hard as I could to get the hatch
                              closing device, and Ed pulling down as best as he
                              could, we were able to force him down into the seat
                              and get the hatch closed fully.   Ed seemed to be up
                              much higher today than he had been in any of our
                              zero-g EVA in the airplane.

         06 56 13         P   Jim.   I don't   think           it was the .....

         06 56 17         C   Go ahead.   Say what             you said.

         06 56 20         P   Yes.   I don't believe we were actually having diffi-
                              culty with the head clearance.   I felt like I had
                              plenty of head clearance and I could actually .....
                              down and manipulate   the dogs. We just seemed to have
                              a little more effort in closing than we had ever ex-
                              perienced before and .....
         06 56 40         C   It was difficult to swing shut because of all the
                              washers that we have in the pyro lines.

    06 97     _0   C         One    thing  that I don't  knot, if we got on tape be:'cre,
      -                      but    both Ed and I mentioned     that we were  quite thank-
                             ful    for all the training    that we'd done   in the alti-
                             tude chamber,    in the zerc-g                        airplane,        and        the    crew
                             procedures   trainer   there at                       Houston.

    06   57   4_   P         You're  not kidding!     I'll second    that.  The things
                             that occurred   were not things     that we hadn't   done
                             before  and things   that we hadn't     worked ol/t pro-
                             cedures  for before.     The things    that we did,  I
                             think,   paid very hea_;   dividends    %¢_ay. I was very
                             thankful    for all the training    that we had and the
                             wurk the people    had done with    us.

    06 58     O1   C         Yes.    I was thankPul   that we                       didn't        have     to       make    a
                             reentry   with the hatch    open.

    06   58   06   P         And another  thing,                     I was glad Jim          had been           working
                             with the dumbells                   a    little  bit to         build  up          those
                             muscles.

    07   OO   46   P         On the books,   I think we want to be sara we put a
                             little  more care   into the kind of rings we use.
                             We've  had difficulty   in opening    two or three differ-
                             ent times   now, and also pages    are tearing   out so
                             that they are not staying     in the book.     We ough_ to
                             look into some kind of reinforcement       for the holes,
                             where the          rings      attach.            On the water          gun, the little
                             teat that          sticks      out the           end of it to          all._w the water
                             to flow out sticks    in the OUT position,     just like it
                             did on the simulator,    and allows    water  to flow after
                             you take the trigger    off.    You have   to, actually,
                             from time to time reseat      it back up in there     to keep
                             the water  from flowing    out of the capsule     when you
                             pull the gun out of the food package.                                      Another  thing,
                             on the drinking hose_  it's very easy                                 to    turn the hose
                             in such an angle when                      you're   drinking   from it to keep
                             the water from flowing                      through    the hose.   Actually,
                             you    crimp       the   hose           right    at   the   end_      right        where       the

                        formations.   They have some very interesting       forma-
                        tions interlaced on the top of them.        Perhaps the
                        camera will pick them up.     It's so bright I'm going
                        to shoot 250 at 16.    Those will be frames 28, 29,
                        and I'll be shooting at least two more.        Those will
                        be 30 and 31.    I should be passing right over the

12 04 54      P         The shutter to the Hasselblad  seems to be delayed in
                        dropping.   I hop_ it's not ruining -- occluding the
                        pictures.

                         I'll wait until I get out just a little further and
                         try to get a broad over-all shot that covers the
                         whole area.

12 09 36    P   Everything's going quite well now, up here now.
                Jim's gone on to sleep ......  four hours of slaep.
                I had a good rest, also and I'm preparing to have a
                dinner of roast beef and cream corn.

                ..... there right over Carla and ..... which ones
                they were.   I believe I got some good Hasselblad
                pictures of them down there, though.   It was quite
                extensive cloud coverage from above and quite a few
                interesting  formations.

12 l0 14   CC   Roger.

12 l0 18    P   Will you pass on also, that we're delaying D- 9 as
                our flight plan calls for because we feel that we
                both should be up for it.  It requires coordination.

12 l0 27   CC   Roger.     WE]]    do.

12 l0 33    P   Right now the pressure in the cabin is holding about
                5.4.  _t seems to hold up there.   That's where she
                went at lift-off.   It seemed to hold there for a
                while    and then    it gradually         drained   down to about
                4.9.

12 l0 46   CC   Okay.  Okay,       everything      here    on the ground      looks
                real good.

12 ll 02    P   It was really       quite    a view    out there     during    the EVA.

12 ll 15    P   Must have been out -- I came out Just as soon as we
                got the GO.   Before Hawaii_ actually, I came out
                ..... following the camera and installing the um-

12 28 42              P       I'm looking out at the stars now.     it's not as --
                              it's light, not fully dark.    It appears that the
                              window gives you a filter that cuts down the smaller
                              magnitude stars.    I'm looking o_  rSght now at the
                              Big Dipper and right on down to Arcturus and ..... ,
                              and it appears to me that what I'_ seeing right now
                              are primarily the second and down lo third order
                              stars.   The smaller ones are cut pretty well out of
                              the picture at the present time.    As you get deeper
                              into night, I think more of them will come out, but
                              you definitely don't see as many stars as you do
                              flying at 40 000 feet in an airplane on a good clear
                              night.

12 30            59   P       The stars of Corbus is right out in view right now.
                              It seems to be in pretty full view.  I'm picking up
                              probably down to about fourth order stars right now.

12 33            45   P       As we get deeper into the night, the other stars are
                              coming out.   I can see them -- I believe I can see
                              down to about fifth magnitude now.     It's still not
                              as brilliant a display of stars as you'd see on a
                              clear night at 20 000 feet out of the canopy of an
                              aircraft.   I've got my lights dimmed way down and it
                              makes a much more spectacular view out.     As a matter
                              of fact, the stars seem to be coming out as my eyes
                              adapt further.   I'm looking right now at the South-
                              ern Cross and the stars around it. There seems to
                              be a somewhat           of a lighted   area around         it.

12 35 I1              P       I've got a very clear horizon now.   It's rather
                              light and I've got a horizon comprised mainly of
                              clouds.  I can see the clouds -- the stars as they
                              start to go down into the main air glow, but the
                              clouds seem to give a more light horizon.   It doesn't
                              seem that we - earlier in the flight we've seen a
                              horizon without clouds and it was much more -- it was
                              a rather thick layer of air glow and you could see
                              the stars as they went down through it.  In this
                              cloud-type horizon though, the stars are more diffi-
                              cult to see; although I do note that some of the
                              brighter ones are visible through it as they set.

12 36 17              P       I'm looking out now at Gruss, and its stars are quite
                              clear, even the small fourth and fifth order magni-
                              tude stars in the .....  This time of evening and at
                              night, the skies are quite black and the stars are
                              quite visible.  I can see at least fifth order.
