00 00 11 48 PAO We did report deployment of the main parachute, we last reported his altitude at seven thousand feet descending.

Note: From this point in the audio tape, commentary is provided by personnel from the aircraft carrier USS Lake Champlain (CV-39). 

00 00 11 59 CV-39 Hello...this is the aircraft carrier Lake Champlain - the parachute and the capsule are still coming down, on the horizon there about even with the clouds, clouds now on the horizon...we are about four miles away from the spacecraft now, it has still not made its impact with the water, the helicopters are about I would estimate halfway through the point of impact, and as we see, the space capsule has not yet made impact with the water. In that lead helicopter ready to pick up the astronaut are First Lieutenant Wayne Koons, the pilot, and Marine co-pilot George Cox. 

00 00 12 47 CV-39 We're now probably no more than three miles away from the – from the parachutes, they're coming into our – they're becoming very clear now. It's very possible that the carrier will be right close to the space capsule, the spacecraft as its being  recovered from the water. It's only a matter of two or three more minutes, it's swaying gently in the wind, from side to side, to one side and then the other, it's a good thing there's a Naval commander inside or he might be getting seasick...

00 00 13 26 CV-39 The lead helicopter is now high up the parachute...they're now hovering over the parachute, and will be ready to pick him up out of the water almost immediately.

00 00 13 44  CV-39 It just hit the water a moment ago! (Personnel from aircraft carrier heard cheering in background) A cheer went up from the ship's company watching it from all decks on the aircraft carrier – the parachute is now flattened against the water, and from this point we are able to tell how the capsule is riding in the water.

00 00 14 06 CV-39 It's too low in the water to tell just how the capsule is riding in the water but there are four or five helicopters in the near vicinity - the lead helicopter number forty four is all right over the capsule. 

00 00 14 30 CV-39 The capsule is up out of the water – right there for the carrier – the helicopter has hooked onto the capsule...

00 00 14 40 CV-39 Correction – the capsule is still floating in the water...as the helicopter hovers overhead to hook onto the capsule. 

00 00 14 52 CV-39 It's still to early to tell whether the astronaut, Alan Shepard, has tried to remove himself through the top escape hatch of the capsule. He may elect to stay in the capsule, arrive back to the carrier in the capsule, then again if he has removed himself from the capsule he can be lifted into the helicopter to ride back probably a little more comfortably...

00 00 15 19 CV-39 The helicopter is hovering right over the spacecraft and of course first they must snip off the antenna from the spacecraft, the radio antenna, the radio...then it will be a matter of hooking onto the capsule and lifting it up out of the water to return here to the deck of the carrier Lake Champlain. 

00 00 15 53 CV-39 The helicopter is lowering the sling, the astronaut is out of the capsule.

00 00 16 07 CV-39 So far we can't tell whether the astronaut inflated his life raft, but he does appear to have gotten out of the capsule – the helicopter has lowered a sling to pick him up.

00 00 16 24 CV-39 The sling has gone to the capsule – the sling that was lowered from the helicopter is down to the spacecraft – it's too early to tell exactly what they're going to do. Of course the first thing is to try and pick up the astronaut, get him into the helicopter, if he has removed himself from [the spacecraft], then to hook the spacecraft and return the vehicle to deck. 

00 00 16 48 CV-39 The astronaut Alan Shepard has just climbed out of the capsule and they are now trying to get him up into the helicopter.

00 00 17 04 CV-39 They're lifting the capsule out of the water – they've already hooked it - we can see it plainly as the helicopter lifts the capsule...as referring along to return here to the deck to the carrier Lake Champlain. We can't be more than a mile and a half or two miles away from them now. Flying overhead are at least two of the tracking planes that were

out here as well as four or five helicopters to convoy the lead helicopter and the spacecraft back to the deck of the carrier Lake Champlain. 

00 00 17 42  CV-39 The crew of the carrier is jammed onto the flight deck behind a farrier waiting for the astronaut to return to welcome him aboard...[The crew would have been disappointed] if one of the other ships had picked up the astronaut. 

00 00 17 56 CV-39 The helicopter took off about twenty five minutes ago, just a few minutes before launch. It's lead helicopter number forty four though that will pick up the astronaut piloted by Marine Corps Lieutenant Wayne Koons of Lyons, Kansas and co-pilot George Cox of Houston, Florida. Cox at this moment is probably sitting in the compartment with the astronaut in the helicopter, but he has been instructed not to talk to the astronaut, answer any questions he may have, they were told, but no one – especially newsmen – will be allowed to ask him any questions until he has been debriefed by doctors. The purpose is to avoid leading questions that may affect Shepard's reactions to his flight in space. 

00 00 18 46 CV-39 The helicopter is approaching the carrier now, it's a matter of only half a mile away...the crew is jammed up onto several decks of the carrier here waiting for him to arrive as well as down on the flight deck of the Lake Champlain.
