[00:01:49:50]
P: 2 08 52.

[00:01:49:53]
C: Elapsed?

[00:01:49:54]
P: Yes.

[00:01:49:57]
P: Okay. Tell them we're sending them a T/M 2 cal.

[00:01:50:04]
C: A T/M 2 cal is coming.

[00:01:50:07]
P: I don't see where it says for us to do that, but I guess that's all right. I think we should have done it on the first pass.

[00:01:50:24]
P: One of these pills came off. (Germicide pills)

P: Corn beef sandwich.

[00:01:52:28]
C: Where did that come from?

[00:01:52:30]
P: I brought it with me. Let's see how it tastes. Smells, doesn't it?

[00:01:52:41]
C: Yes, it's breaking up. I'm going to stick it in my pocket.

[00:01:52:43]
P: Is it?

[00:01:52:49]
P: It was a thought, anyways.

[00:01:52:51]
C: Yep.

[00:01:52:52]
P: Not a very good one.

[00:01:52:54]
C: Pretty good, though, if it would just hold together.

P: Want some chicken leg?

[00:01:53:15]
C: No, you can handle that.

[00:01:53:43]
P: 19 miles.

[00:01:53:45]
C: Dead ahead.

[00:01:53:46]
P: Yeah.

[00:01:53:55]
C: We're alined just about perfect. What do you think, looking out your window?

[00:01:53:59]
P: Yeah, man. That's beautiful!

[00:01:54:05]
C: What else have we got to do? Scanners should be on secondary. Now we're going to yaw 180 degrees here.

[00:01:54:32]
C: Hey, look out there. There's some land.

[00:01:54:36]
P: Yes.

_page : 47
P: Never a doubt.

[00:01:57:14]
P: That's not bad for applesauce.

[00:01:57:18]
C: I'll take a bite of applesauce, if you don't eat it all.

[00:01:57:21]
P: It's getting tough to squeeze out of there.

[00:01:57:40]
C: If we had some pork chops to go with it, we'd be all right.

[00:01:57:41]
P: Yes.

[00:01:57:42]
C: Here it is back. What are you going to do with it now?

[00:01:57:44]
P: What, the applesauce?

[00:01:57:45]
C: Yes.

[00:01:57:47]
P: I don't know, the tablet fell off. I'm not going to put the germicide tablet in, because I don't know where it is.

[00:01:57:53]
C: Let's see what my retrofire attitude looks like going backwards.

[00:01:57:56]
P: Okay.

[00:01:58:11]
P: 16 degrees nose down is what it is.

[00:01:58:13]
C: Yep. I'll be there in a minute.

[00:01:58:17]
P: Oh, man!

[00:01:58:21]
C: I'll tell you, man, you don't need anything to tell your yaw, do you?

[00:01:58:25]
P: No, I'll tell you, I need some of these missions where I can look out of the window. I haven't looked out of this window a second and a half. It's beautiful!

[00:01:58:35]
_page : 48
C: You know, if I lined up the yaw, I'd line it up right there. What does it look like to you?

[00:01:58:44]
P: Look's to me like you got it, Gus.

[00:01:58:46]
C: That's not what the 8-ball shows. It's right there, no doubt about it.

[00:01:58:58]
P: Well, that looks good to me.

[00:01:59:14]
C: Let's try it upside down once.

[00:01:59:16]
P: Okay.

[00:01:59:21]
P: Watch everything float to the ceiling.

[00:01:59:27]
C: There's 60 left, okay?

[00:01:59:48]
P: That's 60 left.

P: There you go.

[00:02:00:05]
P: Isn't that beautiful?

[00:02:00:09]
C: That's 60 left right there. That's hard to fly.

[00:02:00:16]
C: The sun is sure bright.

[00:02:00:53]
C: We can't see the booster. Have to be turned around for this check. We can't see it. We're facing the wrong way.

P: It's bad, isn't it?

[00:02:04:44]
C: That sun is something else.

[00:02:04:45]
P: Yes.

[00:02:04:58]
P: Can you stow these back over there in your side? (Food packages)

[00:02:05:01]
C: Yes.

P: Somehow.

[00:02:05:07]
C: You don't need that towel, do you?

[00:02:05:09]
P: Yes, I'm going to, very shortly.

[00:02:05:11]
C: Well, I'd better get it out then.

[00:02:05:13]
P: Well, I don't think I'll need it, but I might.

[00:02:05:19]
C: Well, we've got a scanner light on secondary.

[00:02:05:27]
C: There, it went out. I guess I was looking at it in the sun.

[00:02:05:29]
_page : 50
P: Yes.

[00:02:05:33]
C: Hope that stops it. now we've got it again.

[00:02:06:10]
C: The sun's around there. That sun's pushing it off.

[00:02:06:13]
P: Yes.

[00:02:06:21]
C: Either that or our ball is out of alinement.

[00:02:06:31]
C: What time's it supposed to be next time. Do you remember?

[00:02:06:33]
P: No.

[00:02:07:07]
P: You don't mind if I make an inflight modification to the pressure suit, do you?

[00:02:07:11]
C: What are you going to do?

[00:02:07:13]
P: Just cut a strap.

[00:02:07:15]
C: I hope you don't cut a hole in it.

[00:02:07:17]
P: No, don't worry.

[00:02:07:33]
C: We've got a scanner ignore light ...

[00:02:07:47]
C: Okay, let's start this thing right now.

[00:02:07:56]
C: Okay, it's pitching up slightly. Going up above zero. I don't have a scanner light. man, is it dark!

[00:02:08:07]
C: I don't have a scanner light, but I don't think it's doing right. We're now 20 degrees above the horizon and have no horizon. It's bringing me back down to 180.

[00:02:08:52]
P: It's dark.

[00:02:08:53]
C: Yes.

[00:02:08:57]

[00:02:08:59]
_page : 51
C: Where?

[00:02:09:00]
P: Over on the right side. I think it's the sun shining on them, or something. Is the sun on my side? Sunset?

[00:02:09:07]
C: It's back behind us some place.

[00:02:09:13]
C: You mean the RCS thrusters?

[00:02:09:15]
P: Yes.

[00:02:09:17]
C: I can't see them.

[00:02:09:18]
P: Can you see yours?

[00:02:09:20]
C: No.

[00:02:09:21]
P: Well, I see mine shining.

[00:02:09:22]
C: I can probably see the horizon now, though.

[00:02:09:24]
P: I see those thrusters.

[00:02:09:29]
P: It's the sun shining off of them, because we haven't used the A-Ring yet.

[00:02:09:32]
C: That must be what it is.

[00:02:09:33]
P: A-Ring isn't hot.

C: 2 hours and 10 minutes.

[00:02:10:05]
P: You're supposed to give an oral temperature.

[00:02:10:07]
C: I'll give them one.

[00:02:10:24]
C: Okay. Translation Check at 2:17, which is 7 minutes away.

[00:02:10:35]
_page : 52
P: Know what kind of transmission check it is?

[00:02:10:37]
C: Translation Check...We're not going to send anything.

C: Those thrusters.

[00:02:11:15]
C: Translation thrusters.

[00:02:11:25]
C: There is a ground light. We're really moving. What would that be?

[00:02:11:29]
P: ...forest fires.

[00:02:11:32]
C: No, it's a pin point. I see it way below the horizon.

C: What time is it?

[00:02:12:23]
P: To what?

[00:02:12:26]
P: I'm supposed to change this tape around here sometime.

[00:02:12:29]
C: Translation Check.

[00:02:12:32]
P: During the check?

[00:02:14:01]

P: Okay. Shoot, we've hardly used any film. Of course there's 130 feet in there. Wait a second till I get the suit closed.

[00:02:15:15]
C: Okay.

P: Gee.

[00:02:15:30]
P: Your recommendation on that covering underwear is well taken.

[00:02:15:41]
C: Man! I don't believe this 8-ball. It is way off. Look at it. It's way off. There's zero right there. Right?

[00:02:16:00]
P: Yes.

[00:02:16:01]
C: It says minus 10 degrees down on the ball. I guess it's that Orbit Rate, isn't it?

[00:02:16:05]
P: Yes, probably.

C: Roger, IVI readouts before the burn were all zeros. After the burn was 10 ft/sec forward.

[00:02:17:38]
CC: Roger. Understand. 10 ft/sec forward.

[00:02:17:42]
C: That was in the 009 degree attitude. 10 ft/sec forward.

C: Carnarvon, this is Molly Brown. Read you loud and clear.

CC: Very good, Gus; we'd like to get a blood pressure on the co-pilot, please, and could I have your status?

[00:02:23:36]
C: Okay -- blood pressure's coming and our status is green.

CC: Very good.  We don't have any communications with the Cape at this time, but they have requested for me to run down your flight control problem a little bit.  The first thing I'd like to know is what kind of rates are you getting if you just let it yaw?

[00:02:23:57]
C: They are very slow, Pete. Probably on the order of a quarter of a degree per second.

CC: Okay and you are in a horizon scan mode, is that correct?

[00:02:24:13]
C: At the present time I'm in Pulse and alining the platform.

CC: Okay.  You're in pulse alining the platform.  Are your ACME logic yaw rate gryos and attitude drivers and all that stuff still primary?

[00:02:24:29]
_extra : CRO-2
C: Affirmative.

CC: Okay, strike all that other stuff. It sounds to me like you've got a mechanical problem in the valve. Is that what you figured?

[00:02:24:36]
_page : 57
C: Roger, it must be very, very slight. We can't see the pressure go down.

[00:02:24:40]
CC: Okay, and you have turned off 3, 4, 7 and 8 yaw circuit breakers and put them on again, and that didn't have any effect?

[00:02:24:46]
C: Yes, we've gone through everything, Pete.

[00:02:24:48]
CC: Okay, and no cross-coupling.

[00:02:24:50]
C: Negative.

CC: Okay. That should keep them happy back there. We are not going to send you a load. Your T<sub>R</sub> is good. I don't have your clock counting down with mine. I guess you have a different one in. We got your blood pressure and your clocks are on as far as SET goes.

C: You're going to make these Horizon Scan Checks after a little bit?

[00:02:27:09]
P: Yes. You do it, because I'm busy here.

[00:02:27:14]
CC: Molly Brown, this is Carnarvon. How do you read?

[00:02:27:18]
C: Still read you loud and clear.

[00:02:27:19]
CC: Okay, you'll probably go over the hill, Gus. You look good here on the ground. We'll see you on your next go.

[00:02:27:25]
C: Roger, thank you, Pete.

[00:02:28:24]
P: Be sure I don't throw any switches over there while I'm moving around.

[00:02:28:27]
C: No, I'll keep a check on you. I don't believe that scanner's doing the right thing by us at all. If it is, the ball isn't.

[00:02:31:25]
C: Want this bag for anything?

[00:02:31:27]
P: Yes, I put the paper towels back in it.

[00:02:31:29]
C: Okay, I can thrust now?

[00:02:31:31]
P: Wait till I get my suit zipped up.

C: Better get that sight out for me.

[00:02:32:11]
P: Huh?

[00:02:32:12]
C: Should get that sight out before long, too.

[00:02:32:13]
P: Okay.

[00:02:32:46]
C: I can't get the auxiliary light off there.

[00:02:33:29]
C: It's really black out there.

[00:02:33:31]
P: Yep.

[00:02:33:46]
C: I've got a scanner ignore light. Shoot, that ball must be way off.

[00:02:33:59]
P: Okay.

[00:02:34:01]
C: Oh, man! It's hot.

[00:02:34:03]
P: What's the matter, Gus?

[00:02:34:04]
C: Oh, there it is. I was losing the horizon. Don't tell me our secondary scanners are out now. That isn't right. Let's see what happens. This ball is way off. Good night! Our ball has drifted way off. Let's just go into daylight and aline the thing.

[00:02:34:50]
P: You've got the answer.

[00:02:34:58]
C: Pulse. Going to use those stars. There's zero roll all right.

[00:02:35:30]
P: Well, that's great! I can't bust up the bag. Sure like to get that smell out of here and the only way I can do it is to bust that bag.

[00:02:35:41]
C: What bag?

[00:02:35:42]
P: It won't break.

[00:02:35:43]
C: What do you mean?

[00:02:35:44]
P: I mean this bacteriacide bag.

[00:02:35:59]
_page : 60
P: Got it -- a little.

[00:02:36:25]
P: There we go.

[00:02:36:48]
C: We're coming into daylight again.

[00:02:37:08]
C: Does that look roll-level to you?

[00:02:37:10]
P: Looks what?

[00:02:37:11]
C: Is that level to you? Looking out the window.

[00:02:37:20]
P: Yes.

[00:02:37:22]
C: What about yaw? I can't really tell yaw, can you?

[00:02:37:26]
P: No.

[00:02:37:28]
P: Have you got that --

[00:02:37:30]
C: What?

[00:02:37:43]
C: Let's see. You don't see the moon any place, do you?

[00:02:37:46]
P: No.

[00:02:37:49]
C: It'll be coming up over my -- on my right here pretty soon.

[00:02:37:59]
P: Boy, I tell you I really dig this zero g. This is the finest way to go I ever saw.

[00:02:39:26]
C: That looks about right in pitch. Roll is off.

[00:02:39:31]
P: Can you stick this on your side?

[00:02:39:34]
C: That mess? Doesn't that go in your food box?

[00:02:39:40]
P: Would if there was any room in it.

[00:02:39:43]
C: I don't have any room.

[00:02:39:45]
P: I don't either.

[00:02:39:46]
C: Drop it back behind the seat, I guess.

[00:02:39:51]
_page : 61
P: I'll try to stick it in the food box.

[00:02:40:30]
P: Okay, what does the flight plan say about here, Gus?

[00:02:40:33]
C: I'm supposed to be doing the Horizon Scanner Check, but I don't have time to do it.

[00:02:40:41]
P: Oh, okay. Well thanks, I'm done. I'm supposed to be doing that O<sub>2</sub> High Rate Check. Is it at 2:40 in the flight plan?

[00:02:40:49]
C: Yes. 2:40 right now.

[00:02:40:53]
P: Okay, we'll got to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. I've --

[00:02:40:56]
C: Man! The primary scanners are working! How about that!

[00:02:40:59]
P: I got to have some light here to look at the oxygen gages. Is that all right?

[00:02:41:02]
C: Yeah, I just can't figure out --

[00:02:41:06]
P: Okay, I'll go to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. O<sub>2</sub> High Rate isn't the way to go.

[00:02:41:28]
P: Okay, MARK. O<sub>2</sub> High Rate.

[00:02:41:29]
C: I'm sure uncomfortable.

[00:02:41:30]
P: Yes, it's bad.

[00:02:41:31]
C: Let's leave the heater switch off and let the oxygen pressure come down a bit.

[00:02:41:33]
P: It will come down, and I mean it will come down!

[00:02:41:36]
C: You got the batteries on?

[00:02:41:37]
P: And at the start of the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate Check, O<sub>2</sub> quantity was reading 65 percent. Cabin pressure was 5.1. Cabin pressure is building slowly.

[00:02:42:17]
P: Look at that suit inlet temperature go up.

[00:02:42:23]
_page : 62
C: Is that moon coming up at about the right spot for you for zero yaw?

[00:02:42:26]
P: I don't see it over here, Gus.

[00:02:42:29]
C: Almost dead ahead. Maybe it's daylight. Maybe it's the sunrise.

[00:02:42:44]
C: Thruster sounds are about like the trainer, aren't they?

[00:02:42:49]
P: Yeah, not bad, is it? See, the O<sub>2</sub> pressure is coming down now. Okay, the mains coming on the line, in case we need the heaters.

[00:02:42:59]
C: Got the scanners again, I guess. That's what I got the last time.

[00:02:43:04]
P: Yeah. Okay, the O<sub>2</sub> pressure is now down to 925 and we have been on O<sub>2</sub> High Rate two minutes. Coming up on two minutes.

[00:02:43:13]
C: What was that?

[00:02:43:14]
P: Cabin pressure relief valve. Cabin pressure relief valve relieves with a loud shhh!

[00:02:43:21]
C: Still don't have that scanner light out. There it goes. That's what caused that thing to go out the last time--when you turned those mains on.

[00:02:43:28]
P: The horizon scanner?

[00:02:43:30]
C: Yes, but it came back on again, though.

[00:02:43:34]
P: That son-of-a-gun is relieving at 5.8, isn't it?

[00:02:43:43]
P: Okay, 2 minutes and 30 seconds O<sub>2</sub> High Rate.

[00:02:43:59]
P: And the Greenwich mean time is 1707.

[00:02:44:07]
C: Hey, give me that sight down there.

[00:02:44:10]
P: Okay.

[00:02:44:11]
_page : 63
C: I'll miss my tracking task.

[00:02:44:16]
P: You know what they did, they turned the sight around.

[00:02:44:19]
C: Really?

P: Yes.

[00:02:44:23]
P: Okay, that's three minutes and ten seconds of O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. Don't want to stay on it five minutes. I think that is more than a guy can stand. The suit inlet temperature is up to 64 and pressure is down to 825. We will shoot it a shot of manual heaters here when it gets to 800.

[00:02:45:15]
P: Okay, MARK. Four minutes on the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate Check. Now we will go to the first shot of manual heaters.

[00:02:45:29]
C: Man! It's almost impossible to see out with the sight in front of you.

[00:02:45:36]
P: Pressure is still dropping. Now it's coming up. Okay.

[00:02:45:59]
C: When you get that scanner light it pitches you right down.

[00:02:46:01]
P: Yeah. That's what they said it'd do, didn't they? Okay, 10 seconds to go, and been holding the manual heater switch in for the last minute. It's keeping the pressure up to 825.

[00:02:46:10]
C: Oh, man! That ball is staying way off --

[00:02:46:13]
P: Okay, MARK. O<sub>2</sub> High Rate recocked.

[00:02:46:15]
C: Give me the mark when you think I've got zero yaw.

[00:02:46:18]
P: Okay.

[00:02:46:24]
C: Oh, man! I don't know about this.

[00:02:46:27]
P: Turning the auto heater off.

[00:02:46:34]
_page : 64
P: Can't see a thing, Gus. The quantity at the end of the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate Check was down to 62 percent. Started at 66 and ended 62. I can't see a thing out the window, Gus, because of the sun.

[00:02:46:58]
C: This is about zero yaw.

[00:02:47:01]
P: Go a little bit left.

[00:02:47:07]
P: That looks pretty good, although --

[00:02:47:09]
C: That's about what we had in pitch attitude for zero before, wasn't it?

[00:02:47:12]
P: Yes.

[00:02:47:14]
P: Okay. At 2:40 in the flight plan --

[00:02:47:22]
C: That shows 30 degrees off on the ball.

[00:02:47:31]
P: Started out at 66 and ended at 62, at 2:40. (Oxygen quantity)

[00:02:47:37]
C: Hey, what time do we come across the coast here?

[00:02:47:40]
P: We come across the coast at 3:04. What time is it?

[00:02:47:44]
C: That's too much pitch-up for zero attitude, don't you think?

[00:02:47:48]
P: Huh?

[00:02:47:49]
C: Is this too much pitch-up for zero attitude?

[00:02:47:51]
P: Yep.

[00:02:47:54]
P: Okay, the OAMS propellant at 2:50 is 62 percent.

[00:02:48:02]
C: You going to leave those mains on?

[00:02:48:03]
P: No.

[00:02:48:05]
C: It's dropping down pretty good.

_page : 65
C: Coming up?

[00:02:48:10]
P: Yes. Well, I'm going to turn them off now and see what happens. Okay. The mains are off. Been on seven minutes while we were on O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. Okay, we are down to 62 percent at three hours. We are two percent under what we should be. That ought to be good enough for a couple of orbits.

[00:02:48:41]
C: I really can't tell whether I have zero yaw or not. What do you think?

[00:02:48:46]
P: Get off some and then I can tell.

[00:02:48:49]
C: I'll take this sight down out of here a second.

[00:02:48:58]
C: I have to get the 8-ball caged.

[00:02:49:02]
P: Now I can tell you have -- haven't.

[00:04:46:15]
CC: Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.

[00:04:46:17]
C: Roger. We're down to 80 000 feet. My needles show us about 25 miles short.

[00:04:46:23]
CC: Roger, indicating about 25 miles short on your computer. Very good.

[00:04:46:33]
CC: I have a drogue time 19 10 42. What is your altimeter reading?

[00:04:46:38]

[00:04:46:54]
CC: Roger, drogue.

[00:04:46:59]
CC: Looks pretty good, doesn't it?

[00:04:47:01]
C: Our propellant valves are shut off. We've got a 40K light. Really oscillating.

[00:04:47:11]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:47:18]
C: Passing through 30 000 feet.

[00:04:47:21]

[00:04:48:16]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:48:40]
CC: Molly Brown, how is your main. Over?

[00:04:48:47]
C: Okay. We have a good stable chute. Going to landing attitude.

[00:04:48:54]
P: Oh, man! That was the roughest one of the whole bunch, wasn't it!?

[00:04:48:55]
C: Oh man!

[00:04:49:01]
C: Okay. We all set?

[00:04:49:02]

[00:04:49:26]
RS: Roger. We are reading you now and then. How us?

[00:04:49:28]
C: Loud and clear. I have 30 ft/sec rate of descent. Passing through 5500.

[00:04:49:34]
P: You never took your D-Ring out, huh?

RS: Roger, 5500.

[00:04:49:36]
C: Yes I did, too!

[00:04:49:37]
P: Oh, did you?

C: You better believe it!

[00:04:49:38]
P: Face plate open?

[00:04:49:40]
C: Open?

[00:04:49:41]
P: That's what the checklist says. Indicate Landing Control circuit breaker open.

[00:04:49:48]
C: What?

[00:04:49:50]
P: Indicate Landing Attitude Control circuit breaker open. That's that second one over on your panel. There you go.

[00:04:49:56]
P: ACME bias power off.

[00:04:49:57]

C: Roger. Thank you.

[00:04:50:04]
P: That'll be nice. Rescue beacon is on.

[00:04:50:08]
C: Do you have us in sight, Intrepid?

[00:04:50:11]
RS: Not yet. Over.

[00:04:50:13]

[00:04:50:16]
C: Rescue beacon coming on.

[00:04:50:19]
C: Passing through 4000.

[00:04:50:21]
P: Suit fan to No. 2.

[00:04:50:28]
C: That drogue chute is right above us, or the pilot chute.

[00:04:50:31]
RS: I understand the drogue is just above you, or the pilot chute.

[00:04:50:35]
C: Say again.

[00:04:50:40]
P: RCS heater's off. We did not do that heater check. Oh, well. We didn't need it anyways. RCS temperature was way up. Scanner Heater circuit breaker open.

[00:04:50:46]
C: Do you smell that fuel? Fumes from that stuff?

[00:04:50:47]
P: Yes. Let's close up.

[00:04:50:52]
C: Yes. I can see 'em smoking out there.

[00:04:50:54]
P: Suit flow increase.

[00:04:50:55]
C: They'll get quenched in a minute.

[00:04:51:02]

P: Reentry Antenna Experiment off.

[00:04:51:05]
_page : 104
P: Okay. Manual O<sub>2</sub> High Rate - PULL. I don't think we want to do that yet, do you?

[00:04:51:09]
C: No.

[00:04:51:19]
C: I imagine it is pretty bad in here.

[00:04:51:21]
P: The water seal is closed. AC power off.

[00:04:51:26]
C: Okay.

[00:04:51:29]
C: We're coming through the lower layer, John. You better get ready to hit. We're at 2000. No telling how far the altimeter is off.

[00:04:51:33]
P: Okay.

[00:04:51:35]
P: I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

[00:04:51:37]
C: You can put your head back.

[00:04:51:39]
P: Landing attitude was a bump, wasn't it?

[00:04:51:40]
C: Yes.

[00:04:51:44]
C: We're at 1500 feet.

[00:04:51:53]
C: We're in good shape.

[00:04:51:58]
C: We may have to go on O<sub>2</sub> High Rate with that smell in here.

[00:04:52:00]
P: I know it.

[00:04:52:04]
C: It's probably just from that hot metal.

[00:04:52:06]
P: I think that's what it is.

[00:04:52:09]
C: I'm sure it is. There's nothing coming out of the thrusters.

[00:04:52:10]
P: No.

[00:04:52:15]

_extra : Impact at 00:04:52:31
C: 300 feet. It ought to be pretty soon now.

[00:04:52:34]
C: Broken my face plate when we went to landing attitude.

P: Did it?

[00:04:52:45]
P: That's what the problem was, right there. (Reference to sight mounting bracket extension)

[00:04:52:50]
C: Look at the smoke coming out the thrusters.

[00:04:52:54]
C: They're off.

[00:04:52:57]
P: I don't understand that.

[00:04:53:03]
P: We better go to O2 High Rate and close the snorkle.

[00:04:53:05]
C: Okay.

[00:04:53:20]
P: Post-landing checklist. Parachute jett-pushed. Landing safe. Safe the landing bus. Helmet off and stowed. I'd leave it on. Arm restraints -
