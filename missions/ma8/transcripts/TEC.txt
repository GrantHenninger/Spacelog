00 00 00 29  CC    Looks real fine from here.
00 00 00 30  P     MARK 30. Okay. Fuel is okay. Oxygen
                            is okay. All systems appear go, and she's
                            getting noisy.
00 00 00 42  P     Not at all too noisy. Easy to talk through.
00 00 00 52  P     Main cabin pressure is remaining on schedule.
                            Fuel is okay. Oxygen is okay. Cabin pressure,
                            10 psi, and she's really moving.

00 00 01 54 CC     Roger. How do you read now, Wally?
00 00 01 55 P      I read you beautiful.
00 00 01 57 CC     You had your transmitter keyed, that's why
                          we couldn't read.
00 00 02 00 P      I'll be darn. I'm push-to-talk now.
00 00 02 05 CC     Standby for staging.
00 00 02 07 P      I have a BECO. I could see the flash.
00 00 02 16 CC     Staging.
00 00 02 17 P      Roger, staging. Standing by for tower. Fuel
                          looks good. Oxygen looks good.
00 00 02 25 CC     Roger. Start a new flight.
00 00 02 27 P      Okay. I'm on push-to-talk, and the sun is
                          coming in the window now. Okay. There goes
                          the tower.
00 00 02 35 CC     Roger.
00 00 02 37 P      Auto retrojett off. This tower really is a
                          sayonara.
00 00 02 41 CC     That pitch should be about -10 (degrees).
00 00 02 43 P      Roger. I have about -5. Cabin pressure is
                          holding very well at, right at 6 psi.
00 00 02 51 CC     Roger.
00 00 02 52 P      And I'll give and electrical check now.

00 00 03 14  P     I'll go back on VOX again. How do you read
                            me on VOX now?
00 00 03 21  P     Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven.
00 00 03 22  CC    Go ahead, Seven.
00 00 03 24  P     Okay. I'm back on push-to-talk.
00 00 03 29  CC    Roger. You have a go from Control Center.
00 00 03 31  P     Roger. You have a go from me. It's real
                            fat.
00 00 03 33  CC    Roger. Have a go from here.
00 00 03 36  P     Roger. It looks real good.
00 00 03 39  CC    Are you a turtle today?
00 00 03 41  P     Going to VOX record only. You bet (Correct
                            answer recorded).
00 00 03 46  CC    Just trying to catch you on that one.
00 00 03 48  P     Nope - okay. I've finished VOX record.
00 00 03 51  P     Coming upon 4 minutes. I'll give you a hack.
00 00 03 54  CC    Good head.
00 00 04 00  P     MARK.T
00 00 04 01  CC    Roger. Right on the nose . . . 3 pitch.
00 00 04 03  P     Okay, and I've got good fuel, about 101-95
                            (percent). Oxygen is fat 65-52 (psi in
                            hundreds), correction 72.
00 00 04 14  CC    Roger.

00 00 04 29 P      Sunlight's in my upper right hand corner of
                          the window, just peeking in at me.
00 00 04 34 CC     Roger.
00 00 04 49 P      How's the V/Vr?
00 00 04 51 CC     I get a 0.8 V/Vr.
00 00 04 53 P      Good show.
00 00 04 59 CC     Standby for SECO.
00 00 05 18 CC     SECO.
00 00 05 20 P      I have SECO. Cap sep, and in aux damp, and
                          it's very pleasant. Going to fly-by-wire
                          low. Going to fly-by-wire.
00 00 05 29 CC     Roger. Fly-by-wire.
00 00 05 32 P      Yaw is answering very nicely. Roll answers
                          nicely. She's turning around very nicely.
00 00 05 44  CC    You have a go, 7 orbit capability.
00 00 05 46  P     Say again, I like that kind.
00 00 05 54  P     I see little ice crystals, I'm sure that's
                          what it is around me now.
00 00 06 01  CC    You're a little garbled.
00 00 06 02  P     Okay. Got a good view of the earth now.
00 00 06 07  P     Coming around to retroattitude. Coming into
                          retroattitude; and a good shot of the sustainer
                          here. It's right in the window where it belongs.
                          I am pitched up a little bit.
00 00 06 26  CC    Roger.
00 00 06 40  P     Okay. Just about into retroattitude.
00 00 06 46  CC    Roger. We have full communications. Tell me,
                          can you confirm retrojett off?


	Page 14
	CNV-1

00 00 06 54 P     That's affirmative. Retrojett is off.
00 00 06 57 CC    That's fine.
00 00 06 58 P     Okay. I'm getting set up for yaw. I can see
                             yaw at (-) 34 already.
00 00 07 10 CC    You say you still have some yaw.
00 00 07 13 P     Roger. I just went into ASCS at about 7
                            minutes and 10 seconds. The sustainer
                             is sitting very steady above me. I should
                             say above the horizon. And I'm in chimp
                            mode right now and she is flying beautifully.
00 00 07 34 CC    I'll give you (contingency recovery area) 1-B
                             retro 16 22.
00 00 07 43  P     Roger. Understand 16 22. Is that correct?
00 00 07 47  CC    Roger. 16 22.
00 00 07 51  P     Okay. I've got my chart case out. I'll put
                             that in. I'll send the blood pressure now
                            for the medics.
00 00 07 59  CC    Roger.
00 00 08 02  P     Boy! That sustainer looks real cute. I'll
                            pick her up in a moment and track her.
00 00 08 09  CC    For your information, you are slightly garbled -
                            slightly garbled.
00 00 08 12  P     Okay. I'll use VOX-push-to-talk as much as
                            possible.
00 00 08 16  CC    Roger.
00 00 08 21  P     Okay, I'm stopping that blood pressure run.
                            Boy! This ASCS made tracking very nice. The
                            sustainer is very stable. It is not oscillating
                            at all. I see no vapors; it looks very
                            clean.

00 00 08 51 P     Say again Deke.
00 00 08 56 P     Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven. Say again.
00 00 09 03 CC    Seven, Cap Com. You are fading - you are
                          fading.
00 00 09 08 P     Roger.
00 00 09 15 P     Cape Cap Com. I read you loud and clear.
00 00 09 29 CC    Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, Cape Cap Com. How
                          do you read?
00 00 09 34  P     Cape Cap Com, this is Sigma Seven. I read you
                          loud and clear. How me?
00 00 10 15  P     Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven. How do you read?
                         Over.
00 00 10 31  P     This is Sigma Seven. Squib off. Three retro
                          fuse switches on. Fire-arm on. Going to
                         fly-by-wire low.
00 00 11 30  P     This is Sigma Seven. Tracking sustainer very
                         easily in fly-by-wire low.
00 00 11 56  P     Am going to manual proportional.
00 00 12 58  P     This is Sigma Seven. I am now in ASCS auto,
                        retroattitude. Manual proportional works very
                        well.
	CANARY ISLANDS
00 00 14 31  P     Canary Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. Over.
00 00 14 40  CT    Sigma Seven this is Canary Com Tech. Transmitting
                         HF/UHF. Do you read? Over.
00 00 14 46  P     Roger. Canary Cap Com this is Sigma Seven.
                         Do you read me?
00 00 14 50  CC    Sigma Seven this is Canary Cap Com. Reading
                         you loud and clear. We have valid radar
                         track.


	Page 16
	CYI-1

00 00 14 55 P     Roger. Good show on radar. Awfully sorry our
                              friend Julian couldn't be with us. I would
                              like to give you my report on control mode.
                              First off, manual and fly-by-wire low are
                              excellent; aux damp works excellent. I am
                              now in auto mode; retroattitude. Attitudes
                              holding beautifully. I am go. My suit
                              temperature is going up a bit. I have set
                              it at 4.5. Over.
00 00 15 29 CC     Roger. I copied suit temperature at 4.5. What
                              does your suit temperature read?
00 00 15 33  P     Negative. That was suit dome - is reading 75
                             (degrees). I have set the suit at 4.5.
00 00 15 43  CC    Roger.
00 00 15 44  P     I am checking on my cabin. It's about 60 (degrees).
                              I am going to leave it alone. The cabin heat
                              exchanger is about 48 (degrees).
00 00 15 54  CC    Roger.
00 00 16 02  P     Canary, as far as I am concerned all control
                              systems are perfect. The manual was slightly
                              sluggish as predicted, but better than I have
                              seen.
00 00 16 14  CC    Roger. Are you on UHF-hi at this time?
00 00 16 19  P     That is affirmative, and will be switching to
                              UHF-lo for a check with you shortly.
00 00 16 24  CC    Roger.
00 00 16 30  P     I have made an electrical check. We had communication
                              problems on the way across. And all the
                              systems checked out very well. Oxygen is holding
                              up very well. I will give the suit circuit a
                              little more time to cool down.
00 00 16 50  P     My suit temperature at this time is 68 (degrees).
                              I am not worried about it yet.

00 00 17 00  P     Everything else is green.
00 00 17 03  CC    Roger.
00 00 17 07  P     I am going to go to gyros free for a Ts + 5
                          check.
00 00 17 11  CC    Roger.
00 00 17 20  CC    I have a (recovery area) 2-1 retrosequence
                          time if you want it.
00 00 17 24  P     Roger. Standby.
00 00 17 26  CC    01 28 21.
00 00 17 30  P     Roger. Correction to 2-1. 01 28 21.
00 00 17 36  CC    That's confirm.
00 00 17 37  P     Roger.
00 00 17 53  P      Okay. Looks like the dome is coming down a
                          little bit. I'll stick with this setting
                          for awhile.
00 00 18 00 CC    Which dome is that?
00 00 18 01 P     That is the suit dome. The cabin dome is 55
                         (degrees).
00 00 18 07 CC    Roger 5.
00 00 18 10 P     Canary Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. Do you
                          read?
00 00 18 12 CC    I copy cabin dome setting at 5.5 and suit dome
                          at 4.5.
00 00 18 18 P     Now those are not settings. Let me go over that.
                          Suit dome temperature is 75 (degrees). Cabin
                          dome temperature is 56 (degrees). Suit setting
                          on the coolant valve is 4.5. Cabin setting is
                          4. Do you understand?

00 00 18 40 CC    I copy now.
00 00 18 41 P     Okay. Going back to gyros normal. Ts+5
                            confirmed.
00 00 18 46 CC    Roger.
00 00 18 57 P     I see we're coming across the coast. I haven't
                            used the periscope too much as yet.
00 00 19 04 CC    Roger. Are you on UHF-hi yet - or lo yet?
00 00 19 08 P     Negative. I will switch to lo now before I lose
                            you. VOX off.
00 00 19 37 P      Canary Cap Com, Sigma Seven. On UHF-lo. How do

                            by for your short report.
00 00 21 38  P     Roger. I am go. All system are go. I am in ASCS
                            auto; maneuver is off. My Tr-10 bypass is to
                            normal. The fuel and oxygen are all green.
                            Everything is green. I am fat here. I would
                            like a CET time check.

00 00 22 00 CC    Understand you want a CET ground check.
00 00 22 02 P     That's correct.
00 00 22 04 CC    Roger. At my mark it will be 22 10. MARK.
T
00 00 22 12 P     Roger. I am right on.
00 00 22 15 P     I am changing my suit setting to almost 5.
                           Over.
00 00 22 22 CC    Understand. Changing suit setting to number 5.
00 00 22 27 P     That is correct. The dome temperature is at this
                           time approximately 77 (degrees). I will leave
                           it at number 5 for at least 10 minutes.
00 00 22 54 CC    Kano Cap Com standing by for any further reports,
                           Sigma Seven.
00 00 22 57 P     Roger. Kano. Looks like you got good weather
                           down there.
00 00 23 01 CC    That's affirm. Do your attitude displays check
                           with your visual reference?
00 00 23 10  P     Very well. I noticed that the yaw reticle is
                           performing quite well. I've been using it
                           crossing land here.
00 00 23 19  CC    Roger. Understand.
00 00 23 23  P     I am going to try some of the periscope now.
                          Rather unusual sight through the periscope.
                          Not as thrilling as through the window, I'll
                          have to admit.
00 00 23 42  CC    Understand.
00 00 23 44  P     Looks like we are coming up on some cloudy
                          weather.
00 00 24 07  CC    Seven, our telemetry pitch attitude shows about
                         27 (degrees) minus and your scanner output shows
                         about - oh, -36 (degrees).


	Page 20
	KNO-1

00 00 24 17 P     Roger. I'm right on -34 (degrees). It correlates
                            with the window reference mark and I feel quite
                            content we are right on.
00 00 24 28 CC    Very good.
00 00 24 30 CC    How is your suit temperature doing now?
00 00 24 32 P     The suit temperature is now . . . still going up
                            a little bit, it's about 72 (degrees). I am
                            setting at suit . . . number 5 and I'll give it
                            a little more time to try to cool down.
00 00 24 55 P     As soon as we have got a reverse in flow of this
                            dome temperature we'll have a cut at it, I think.
00 00 25 00 CC    Roger.
00 00 25 01 P     Okay, we are picking up some pretty fair clouds
                            now.
00 00 25 13 P     My inverters look real good.
00 00 25 15 CC    Roger. Understand. What does your suit dome
                            temperature look like now?
00 00 25 20 P     It looks like it is holding. I may have to
                            increase it after a little while. I'll let
                            it sit for awhile.
00 00 25 34 CC    All the T/M systems look good, Seven.
00 00 25 36 P     Roger. I think the only problem I have is the
                            suit circuit. I'll work on it for awhile and
                            see how we are.
00 00 25 43 CC    Takes a wee bit of time for that to stablize?
00 00 25 46 P     Right. That's what I am trying to do.
00 00 25 57 P     The dome now is still holding at 78 (degrees).
                            I think I will let it set for a little bit
                            longer.
00 00 26 06 CC    Say again that temperature.

	Page 21
	KNO-ZZB-1

00 00 26 08 P     The suit dome is 78 (degrees).
00 00 26 11 CC    Understand.
00 00 26 17 P     Cabin dome is 60 (degrees).
00 00 26 48 P     Cabin dome - Kano this is Sigma Seven. Do you
                       read?
00 00 26 52 CC    LOS Seven.
00 00 26 54 P     Roger. Cabin dome is working very well. It's
                       just fluctuating.
00 00 27 04 CC    Roger.
00 00 27 05 P     It goes between 52 and 58 (degrees). And I owe
                       Frank Samonski, so far at least, 50 cents.
00 00 28 48 P     At this time, I have three axes practically on
                       retroattitude. The yaw through the reticle
                       usually observed as a rate and I am now trying
                       to check for a change in attitude in yaw. I
                       do notice that one cloud, even, gives you an
                       attitude immediately as a reference. It's
                       almost too accurate for the actual observation
                       that I have within the capsule.
00 00 29 39 P     I am now going to low mag. Correction high mag
                       on the periscope see how it looks? . . . yawed
                       right about 5 degrees. See how she matches up
                       with the periscope at this point. Say, we have
                       the yaw axes (indicator) at about 10 degrees
                       right, at this time, and clouds are tracking
                       right up the line, as if the yaw axes might be
                       off by as much as 5 to 6 degrees. Now this may
                       be a minor problem; we will have to observe it.

00 00 30 28 CT    Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, . . . HF and UHF.
00 00 30 35 P     Hello Kano. This is Sigma Seven. You are both
                       coming in broken but clear. Over.

00 00 30 44  P     Roger.
00 00 30 47  CC    Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is Zanzibar Cap Com.
                          Over.
00 00 30 53  P     Kano Cap Com, you are coming in weak and broken.
                          Gver.
00 00 30 59  CC    This is Zanzibar Cap Com, Zanzibar Cap Com. Over.
00 00 31 03  P     Roger. Zanzibar. Sorry I miscalled you. I am going
                           to set my . . . setting on the suit coolant valve
                           to 5.5. Over.
00 00 31 23  P     Zanzibar this is Sigma Seven. Do you read?
00 00 31 27  CC    Seven this is Zanzibar. You were cutting out. I
                          didn't get your last message. Will you repeat?
00 00 31 32  P     Roger. Standby, I'm switching to UHF-hi.
00 00 31 36  CC    Roger.
00 00 31 58  P     Hello, Zanzibar this is Sigma Seven. How do you
                           read? Over.
00 00 32 02  CC    Seven this is Zanzibar Cap Com. Read you loud and
                           clear now. Go ahead.
00 00 32 05  P     Roger. I have set my suit control valve to 5.5. The
                           suit dome temperature is 80 (degrees). Over.
00 00 32 19  CC    Roger. Understand.
00 00 32 20  P     The cabin dome is 55 (degrees) and is apparently
                          under control.
00 00 32 27  CC    Roger. Understand.
00 00 32 30  P     My suit temperature has come down to 75 (degrees) at
                           this time.
00 00 32 36  CC    Roger.
	Page 23
	ZZB-1

00 00 32 38  P     In fact, that's a correction, it hasn't come down.
                       It's just going there. I would like to give you
                       a briefing on my control mode. I am in auto mode,
                       the bypass switch is normal, maneuver off. Fuel
                       is in the green. Oxygen is way in the green. All
                       electrical is in the green.
00 00 33 03  CC    Roger. Seven. Your (recovery area) 2-1 retrosequence
                       time is 01 28 21. Over.
00 00 33 20  CC    Seven, Zanzibar.
00 00 33 21  P     Roger. I'm sorry I was trying to get my card out. I
                       understand 01 28 21.
00 00 33 25  CC    Yeah.
00 00 33 27  P     Okay.
00 00 34 39  CC    . . . Zanzibar.
00 00 34 41  P     Go ahead, Zanzibar.
00 00 34 44  CC    All systems are green here on the ground. We get
                       a good T/M.
00 00 34 52  P     Roger. Zanzibar. I'm all green here. I'm still
                       working on the suit current circuit.
00 00 35 02  CC    Roger. How do you feel? Uncomfortable?
00 00 35 05  P     I feel quite comfortable. I'm a little warm.
                       Particularly from sunlight but other than that I
                       feel fine.
00 00 35 13  CC    Roger.
00 00 35 14  P     I am holding the suit control setting at 5.5 for a
                       little longer.
00 00 35 22  CC    Roger. You changed that over Kano awhile ago.
                       Affirmative.
00 00 35 24  P     That's correct. Looks like you got pretty good
                       weather down there, too.


	Page 24
	ZZB-1

00 00 35 33  CC    Very good.
00 00 35 34  P     I've got a lot of good clouds for yaw checks. I'll
                            say that.
00 00 35 37  CC    Right.
00 00 35 38  P     Would you check your yaw reading on what you read for
                           me in yaw at this time?
00 00 35 48  CC    Roger. We are getting about a +5 degrees. Over.
00 00 35 51  P     Roger. Concur. I am trying to come back toward 0
                            (degrees) now.
00 00 36 01  CC    Roger. We are pulling you right back to 0 (degrees)
                           now.
00 00 36 03  P     Okay. That's the - that's the ASCS system doing it
                            for me, of course. I'm going to have to increase
                            the suit setting. I'm just barely breaking even.
                            I'm going to set the suit control valve to number 6.
00 00 36 18  CC    Roger. Understand. It's been about 10 minutes.
00 00 36 22  P     Roger. Thank you. The cabin is holding very well on
                            settings, and I'm perfectly comfortable there.
00 00 36 57  CC    Seven this is Zanzibar. We have LOS in approximately
                            1 minute. Anything else to report?
00 00 37 03  P     Nothing. I will keep the suit setting at this point
                            until it gets a little hotter. If it does I may
                            have to go up another half notch at about 45 (minutes),
                            before I get to Woomera.
00 00 37 15  CC    Roger. Understand. I would like a reading on that
                            before we get LOS please.
00 00 37 19  P     Roger. My system is 6. The dome is 81, 81 (degrees).


	Page 25
	ZZB-1

00 00 37 44 CC    Seven. All systems are still performing well here
                        on the ground.
00 00 37 47 P     Roger.
00 00 38 11 P     This is Sigma Seven. Somebody broadcasting in the
                        blind, I do not read you too well.
00 00 38 18 CC    Seven this is Zanzibar. Read you 5 by.
00 00 38 20 P     Roger. You are garbled. I will give you an HF
                        call shortly.
00 00 38 25 CC    Roger.
00 00 38 48 CC    Zanzibar Cap Com. In the blind. How do you read?
                        Over.
00 00 38 57 P     This is Sigma Seven. I read you. It's rather . . .
                        very garbled. I did not observe my HF antennas on
                        turnaround. The rages were just too much smaller,
                        I assume. I am going to switch now to VOX off and
                        go to HF.
00 00 39 45 P     Canary Com Tech, Canary - correction. Zanzibar,
                        Zanzibar this is Sigma Seven. On HF. How do you
                        read? Over.
00 00 40 11 P     Hello Muchea, hello Muchea Cap Com this is Sigma
                        Seven. HF. How do you read? Over.
00 00 41 00 P     This is Sigma Seven. I have noticed minute objects
                        that I can knock off the capsule, one or two, in
                        the bright sunlight at CET 41 10.
00 00 41 17 CT     Seven this is Zanzibar. I barely read you HF check.
                        Over.
00 00 41 23 P     Roger, Zanzibar, I read you loud and clear at this
                        time. That is at 41 30 Zanzibar, getting HF loud
                        and clear.
00 00 41 43 P     Muchea Cap Com, Muchea Cap Com. Sigma Seven HF.

00 00 41 49 P        I am switching to push-to-talk.
00 00 42 00 P      Muchea Cap Com, Sigma Seven. HF check,
                               push-to-talk. Over.
00 00 42 36 CT     . . .
00 00 42 51 ?      12 53 00. He talked to Guaymas after we
                               finished and IOS picked him up. Out.
00 00 43 01 P      The last station that talked on HF I could not
                               identify. It came in very clear and should be
                               recorded aboard the capsule at approximately
                               43 minutes, 10 seconds elapsed time.
00 00 43 24 P      I have switched to VOX transmit and record. I
                               am satisfied that I can see yaw through the
                               window on ASCS without the use of the reticle
                               by letting images come up from all sides.     
                               It's only a matter of a short period of time
                               before objects show translation immediately.
00 00 44 07  P     The pitch scribe mark does indicate up a little
                               bit and as a result matches the retroattitude,
                               which at this time, is 30 degrees. I am now
                               yawed right approximately 10 degrees, and it
                               looks like I am tracking right down the line.
00 00 44 35  P     I am at 45 minutes. I am going to increase the
                               suit setting knob just a small amount, about a
                               quarter of a turn. I think we almost have
                               control of the situation. I have set the suit
                               knob at 6.25. The dome temperature at this time
                               is 82 (degrees). Suit inlet is 76 (degrees).
00 00 45 10  P     I definitely can see a right roll at this time
                               of about 5 degrees, and I noticed the periscope
                               is dark, meaning we are coming into the dark
                               side. I will attempt to look for the changes
                               through the periscope for any observations.

                          At this time, I can see nothing through the periscope
                          for night observation, at least in this
                          attitude. I'm not even sure when I have low mag,
                          other than the position of the lever. The window
                          is cloudy. I have sunlight on it now and it definitely
                          has been clouded over by the escape tower
                          rocket, not to a great degree. I am seeing the
                          so-called fireflies drift dramatically at this
                          point. I tried a couple of knocks and they
                          definitely have a relative velocity to the vehicle,
                          but apparently are part of the same orbital system,
                          I definitely see them as white objects.
00 00 46 39  P     I would like to take some water to drink at this
                          point, but I would rather keep the visor shut to
                          keep the system attempting to cool down. We may
                          make some progress on the cold side. It looks like
                          I am going to have to decrease the cabin, it's gone
                          down to 45 (degrees) dome. I'm coming to 3.5
                          on the cabin.
00 00 47 03  P     Checking on inverters at this time. They look very
                          good. 150 is 102 (degrees). 250 is approximately
                          107 (degrees). Going back to cabin heat exchanger.
00 00 47 24  P     Coming into the night side now at approximately 47
                          minutes elapsed time. I set the cabin suit to 3.5.
                          The suit dome is now just, correction - the cabin
                          dome is nearing 50 (degrees) again. I will leave
                          that setting at 3.5 for a period of time.
00 00 48 19 P      With this much sunlight, I cannot see stars at all.
                          Sun is off to my left and I am getting close to
                          sunset at approximately - 49 is the schedule time.
                          That's just about right on. I'm approaching 49
                          and the cabin lights are on white. I am going to
                          switch the cabin lights to red. And turn off that
                          blasted lift-off correlation clock light.
00 00 49 03 P      Oh, I almost missed my first sunset trying to get the
                          right cabin light off. It is rather rapid as I was
                          told it would be. I am not able to, there I have
                          got Arcturus right on the right side where it
                          belongs.

                Very nice. I should be able to pick up Muchea shortly,
                at 50. Having trouble seeing the clock at 49 minutes.

	MUCHEA

00 00 49 44  CC  Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, this is Muchea Cap Com. Do you
                read? Over.
00 00 49 49  P   Muchea Cap Com. Sigma Seven. HF. I read you loud and
                clear. Over.
00 00 49 54  CC  Roger. You are loud and clear also. How do you feel?
00 00 49 58  P   I feel very good, Gene. I am on HF at this time with the
                dipole. The--I've readjusted the cabin setting. It--the
                dome went down to about 45 degrees. I set the cabin at
                3.5 as the cabin coolant valve setting. Do you understand?
00 00 50 22  CC  You set the cabin at 3.5. Is that correct?
00 00 50 25  P   That's right because it is reading a little low. On the suit,
                I am now at 6 and I am going to increase to 6.5. I am not
                making much progress. I went to about 6.25 about 5 minutes
                ago and I'm now, setting the suit control to 6.5. The dome
                is reading 82 [degrees].
00 00 50 50  CC  Checked the dome temperature on the suit is 82 [degrees] and
                you have just now set to 6.5. Do you feel too hot or
                anything?
00 00 50 58  P   No. I have beads of perspiration on my lips. That's about all.
00 00 51 07  CC  Can we have a suit temperature . . . ?
00 00 51 10  P   Say again.

	Page 29
	MUC-1

00 00 51 12 CC     Roger. Go ahead with status report. Over.
00 00 51 15 P      Okay. I am in auto mode at this point. Everything
                          is acting perfectly. The maneuver switch
                          is off. The systems are all green. I'm
                          practically using no auto fuel. My only
                          problem area is the suit circuit, which I am
                          monitoring very carefully.
00 00 51 36 CC     Roger. Sigma Seven, I'll now give you an
                          emergency voice check. The next transmission
                          will be on emergency voice.
00 00 51 46 P      Roger.
00 00 51 50 CC     Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is Muchea Cap
                          Com on emergency voice. Do you read? Over.
00 00 51 56 P      This is Sigma Seven. Read you loud and clear
                          Gene on emergency voice. Very good. I am
                          setting it down at about volume level 4.
00 00 52 04  CC     Roger.
00 00 52 06  P      I'll give you a blood pressure.
00 00 52 08  CC     Roger.
00 00 52 15  CC     Has anybody asked you yet to drink water,
                          Sigma Seven?
00 00 52 18  P      Negative. I've tried not to get into that.
                          If I can get the suit temperature down a little
                          bit, I'll open the visor and get some water
                          then.
00 00 52 25  CC     Roger. Understand. Status of the Woomera
                          flare test is okay. They are going to light
                          them, but there is broken clouds and light
                          rain. No lightning reported. They will fire
                          flare.

00 00 52 38  P     Is the place covered with clouds? Over.
00 00 52 43  CC    Negative. Broken clouds - the last estimate
                               I got was 0.8 and several breaks.
00 00 52 50  P     Roger. Understand.
00 00 52 54  CC    Sigma Seven, will you give us a cabin heat
                               exchanger temperature, please. Over.
00 00 52 58  P     Roger. That is 41 degrees. Over.
00 00 53 05  CC    Roger. Understand. Your body temperature
                               readouts on the ground are not good. We
                               are not paying any attention to your body
                               temperature readouts. Over.
00 00 53 16  P     Roger. I understand.
00 00 54 09  CC    Sigma Seven this is Muchea. What is your suit
                               dome temperature again?
00 00 54 13  P     It is now holding at 82 (degrees), at a coolant
                               setting of 6.5. Over.
00 00 54 23  CC    Say again - being interfered with there. Will
                               you repeat?
00 00 54 29  P     Roger. My dome temperature is 82 (degrees).
                               My coolant . . . 82, number 82.
00 00 54 43  CC    Sigma Seven. Your transmissions are now very
                               noisy. We will stand by and not contact you
                               for awhile. You are due to contact Woomera
                               in about 3 minutes.
00 00 54 57  P     Roger.
00 00 55 08  P     Woomera. this is Sigma Seven. Over.
00 00 55 13  CC    Go ahead. Sigma Seven.


	Page 31
	MUC-1

00 00 55 15 P      Is this Muchea or Woomera?
00 00 55 17 CC     Muchea. You are coming in much better now.
00 00 55 19 P      Roger. I have the moon right in the center of
                           my field of view. It's a marvelous yaw
                           reference. Just no sweat on it at all.
00 00 55 29 CC     Roger. Understand. Very good yaw reference.
00 00 55 32 P      That's affirmative. I'm still on automatic
                           control. I'm going to switch to fly-by-wire
                           shortly.
00 00 55 41 CC     Roger. We will standby and expect you to report
                          control mode when you change to fly-by-wire low;
                          and gyros free.
00 00 55 49 P      I am switching - My cabin is working okay. The
                          suit is okay. I'm going to go down for the
                          yaw check. Correction, for the flare check
                          now. I'm pitching down in fly-by-wire low.
00 00 56 05 CC     Roger. Understand.
00 00 56 12 P      Fly-by-wire low working very well. Trying to
                          hold -40 (degrees in pitch). Correction,
                          -50 (degrees).
00 00 56 27 CC     Roger.
00 00 56 29 P      Setting is -50(degrees). Gyros are free. Holding
                          at -50 (degrees). Standing by for flare. Roll
                          and yaw are holding. I see the flare on my
                          left which is kinda wrong, I think. I think
                          I saw a flash of lightning. Probably - that is
                          lightning I'm seeing, not the flare. I'm
                          seeing more lightning. It is going to be hard
                          to tell what I am seeing whether it's lightning
                          or flares.

	WOOMERA

00 00 57 09 CC     Sigma Seven this is Woomera Cap Com. Over.
00 00 57 12 P      Roger. Woomera. Go ahead.
00 00 57 15 CC     This is Woomera Cap Com. Flare ignition will
                              be in 1 minute 20 seconds.
00 00 57 20 P      That's one reason why I can't see it, because
                              I am looking at lightning, obviously.
00 00 57 25 CC     And I didn't receive your gyro switch position.
00 00 57 29 P      Roger. I am in fly-by-wire low and I have
                               gyros free.
00 00 57 37 CC     Roger.
00 00 58 08 P      There appears to be no trouble at all in
                               tracking the gyros. The - there was a large
                               problem for me in trying to get the right cabin
                               light dimmed down to red. It's very hard to
                               reach due to ditty bag. I have not even
                               messed around with the camera. I don't intend
                               to until I have the suit circuit under control.
00 00 58 35 CC     Roger. You have 5 seconds to flare ignition.
00 00 58 39 P      Roger. I am tracking -50 degrees pitch.
00 00 58 42 CC     Ignition now.
00 00 58 43 P      Roger. I have lightning only. It looks like
                               you're just about socked in. I'll stay here
                               for a while and then come back up to ASCS
                               shortly. I think I saw lightning right below
                               me but it couldn't have been the flare. It
                               should burn steadily as I understand it.
00 00 59 03 CC     Correct.


	Page 33
	WOM-1

00 00 59 07 P      The lightning looks like a big blob, rather
                          than a jagged streak we are use to seeing
                          when earthbound. Just looks like a big -
                          almost like a antiaircraft shot. A big
                          blob of bright light, and then it fades out
                          almost instantly. It definitely looks like
                          you are overcast. By the way, how is my HF
                          coming through to you all?
00 00 59 35 CC     Clear at Woomera.
00 00 59 37 P      Very good. I am on HF and dipole, as you may
                          know.
00 00 59 41 CC     In fact, we picked you up when you began
                          working Muchea.
00 00 59 44 P      You did? Very good. Well, looks like we got
                          the poles out.
00 00 59 48 CC     Roger.
00 00 59 57 P      I think I'm going to - between you and Canton,
                          will make another attempt at the suit
                          temperature control. We, definitely, aren't
                          making much progress. I'm holding my own.
                          That's all.
00 01 00 15 CC     Roger. You're picking up a little plus yaw
                          now.
00 01 00 19 P      Roger. I concur. I was looking for the flare.
                          Are you lit now?
00 01 00 24 CC     From heresay. Have you found it?
00 01 00 26 P      Roger. I've got a steady light in sight.
                          That's because I've pitched up though. Now,
                          it looks like we're getting much clearer
                          weather here.
00 01 00 37 CC     . . ..


	Page 34
	WOM-1

00 01 00 41 P      Must have some ground lights in sight
                            here.
00 01 00 53 CC     Picking up some plus roll now.
00 01 00 55 P      Very good. I've been searching around a
                            little bit for this. Okay, I'm going to hold
                            that pitch still now. Holding the yaw still.
                            Stopping roll. And I'm sorry I can't see your
                            flare. I'm going to start pitching for ASCS.
00 01 01 29 CC     We have 10 seconds of flare left, and Cape
                            requests your suit temperature.
00 01 01 36 P      Say again.
00 01 01 45 CC     Requesting your suit inlet temperature and dome
                            temperature.
00 01 01 49 P      Roger, my suit inlet is 78 (degrees), my dome
                            temperature is 82 (degrees).
00 01 02 00 CC     Sigma Seven this is Woomera Cap Com. Your
                            transmission was not received.
00 01 02 06 P      Roger, my suit inlet is 78 (degrees).
00 01 02 07 CC     What is your suit and dome temperature?
00 01 02 22 P      This is Sigma Seven. I say again. My suit
                            inlet temperature is 78 (degrees). My suit
                            dome is 82 (degrees).
00 01 02 33 CC     Okay. We got that.
00 01 02 34 P      Roger. I'm going to increase my setting to 7
                            on the coolant control on the suit. I'm
                            now in automatic mode, gyros are normal.

00 01 02 52 P      The suit coolant valve setting is 7. That
                           is correct.
00 01 02 56 CC     Scanners and attitudes agree here.
00 01 02 58 P      Roger. I'm in orbit mode and tracking very
                          well.
00 01 03 03 CC     Roger. We had T/M LOS. Correction, we've got
                          it back.
00 01 03 07 P      Roger. I'm going to decrease the cabin setting
                          It's still running a little cool.
00 01 03 20 CC     Roger.
00 01 03 22 P      I will set the cabin at setting number 3.
00 01 03 27 CC     Roger. Number 3 for cabin.
00 01 03 30 P      I just set now, MARK,<sup>T</sup> at number
                          3, and the suit is riding at number 7.
00 01 03 38 CC     Roger. And Woomera has had T/M LOS. We are
                          standing by HF.
00 01 03 47 P      Roger. Am definitely see some white at this
                          time under the overcast, and I'm sure it must
                          be one of your major cities, possibly Brisbane.
                          I'm not sure.
00 01 04 06 CC     All we got was, "under the overcast", on that
                          transmission.
00 01 04 10 P      It looks like a city under the overcast. I'm
                          not sure. At about - almost right in the
                          middle of the window at this time.
00 01 04 26 CC     Sigma Seven, Woomera read your last transmission.
00 01 04 57 P      This is Sigma Seven. Going to fly-by-wire low
                          and pitching up to reentry attitude. Selecting
                          reentry on attitude select.


	Page 36
	WOM-1

00 01 05 56 P      I'm now in reentry attitude. Standing by to
                             go into automatic mode. Fly-by-wire tracks
                             absolutely beautifully, just as it worked in
                             the trainer. Very positive results from
                             using the procedures trainer. There is no
                             doubt about it, time does pass rather rapidly.
                             Going back to automatic mode. I got pitch
                             down signal, just a slight low thruster, and
                             everything seems to be all right. This probably
                             was a slight error in the corrected readout.
                             I was right on, I believe, in all three axes.
                             The capsule logic is working very well, and is
                             tracking very well in reentry.
00 01 06 50  P      I will check my time as 1 plus 06 plus 50 seconds
                             when I went into reentry attitude. The stars
                             are very easy to see. I see quite a few, but
                             am bothered by a considerable amount of red
                             light. I, now, am going to devote some attention
                             to the suit circuit for a minute or so.
                             Then prepare to go back into retro attitude for
                             Canton.
00 01 07 28  P      One definitely gets the illusion of looking way
                             up above you at this attitude, and if there is
                             no horizon, it's just a black sky. The amount
                             of light in the cockpit is quite high. Once
                             one gets adapted and it can be reduced, of
                             course, by the cabin light. At this point, I
                             am somewhat reluctant to reduce the light level
                             in here, due to the problem with the suit
                             circuit. I'm using my fingertip lights liberally.
                             It is observed that in future flights, we must
                             have some catch-all device that we can stuff
                             objects into, and have them trapped there for
                             a period of time. I'm driving at the problem
                             of the washer and small crimped piece of metal.
                             I . . . believe I finally got them stuffed into
                             the little bag on the hatch. Suit temperature
                             is just holding its own. I am hot, and
                             probably will have to decrease the setting. I
                             am sure I don't understand why the suit circuit
                             takes so long to react. My cabin circuit works
                             beautifully. I'm going to go back to fly-by-wire
                             low; select retroattitude; and fly to retroattitude.

                              All systems are green, but for suit circuit,
                              which I am working on carefully. I am in ASCS
                              retroattitude; gyros normal; maneuver off.
                              I am working on the suit circuit. I am still

                              Repeat all others.
00 01 13 17  P      Roger. I am holding the suit coolant valve
                              setting, George, at number 7. Over.
00 01 13 25  CC     Say again. Holding suit at what and what?

                              You did read my gyros were normal? I'd like to
                              get the suit circuit discussed. Everything

00 01 14 08 P      I have the suit setting for the control valve

                          of 82 (degrees). I have suit inlet of 78
                          (degrees). Do you understand?
00 01 14 26 CC     Roger, Sigma Seven. I understand.
00 01 14 29 P      I am increasing my suit setting at this time
                          to 7.5. Over.
00 01 14 37 CC     Roger, Sigma Seven. Understand increasing your

00 01 14 44 P      That is affirmative.

00 01 15 35 P      Not uncomfortably hot, but just a little warm.
                          I'm trying not to take a drink of water until
                          I can get this suit circuit under control. If
                          I can't get it under control right away, I
                          will be drinking some water.

00 01 18 33  P     I'd just as soon not even go into it. Finally
                   got one dosimeter out, and will have to put
                   it up on the hatch and it's the - let me

00 01 24 12  P     Hello, Guaymas Cap Com, Guaymas Cap Com.
                   Sigma Seven. HF. Over.
00 01 24 40  P     I'm now starting to see the sunrise in the
                  periscope. First light in the periscope
                  during this particular orbit as a result of
                  the night side. It is obvious that the periscope
                  has no function whatsoever in retroattitude
                  on the night side. First light that I get is
                  right now at a CET of practically 1 25 - 1 hour
                  and 25 minutes. The sunrise is coming in


	Page 41
	HAW-GYM-1

                            rather rapidly through the periscope.
                            I do have the lighted objects that John
                            mentioned, and I can create some by knocking
                            them off. I definitely have a sensation of
                            their being a field and varying in size from
                            small to bright. The periscope itself is
                            blinding me. I'll have to put the chart on
                            it, so I can see out the window. I am in
                            condition for retro at anytime, so I have
                            nothing else to do but look out this window.
                            Assuming that the suit circuit is satisfactory.
                            That chart helps no end to cover up that
                            blasted periscope. Quite a large field of these
                            objects. Definitely is confirmed that you can
                            knock them off the hatch, as Scotty said. And
                            they stream off at, definitely there is no
                            problem in judging that they are going away
                            from the capsule, at a different rate than you
                            are. They are definitely going slower, in
                            velocity, than the capsule itself. One rap,
                            and you can see them sliding aft. They are
                            too small an object for photography. I would
                            not even attempt to take a picture of them.
                            Retroattitude is being held very well by the
                            ASCS. I should be able to reach Guaymas by now.

00 01 26 52  CT    Guaymas Com Tech on HF/UHF. Do you read? Over.
00 01 26 56  P     Guaymas Cap Com, Guaymas Cap Com this is Sigma
                            Seven. Over.
00 01 26 59  CC    Guaymas Cap Com, reading you 3 by 3. Give me a
                            quick rundown on how you feel, Wally, and suit
                            and dome and inlet temperatures, please.
00 01 27 09  P     Right, Scott. I feel fine. I'm sure we're
                            getting in on this suit circuit. The dome
                            temperature is holding now. It's just about
                            81 (degrees). I'm making a change in it. The
                            suit inlet temperature is at about 78 (degrees).
                            I think another cut at the controls will solve
                            this problem.


	Page 42
	GYM-1

00 01 27 29 CC     Roger. Say again your suit inlet temperature,
                             please, and what is your control setting?
00 01 27 34 P      Roger. The suit inlet is 78 - 78 degrees. The
                             setting is exactly 7.5 on the circuit control valve.
00 01 27 46 CC     Roger.
00 01 27 50 P      Scott, I feel we're in very good shape for one more
                             orbit at least, and we'll see how we can hack this
                             suit circuit here.
00 01 27 58 CC     Understand, Wally. We have a go. Are you ready to
                             copy (recovery areas) 3-1 and 6-1 times?
00 01 28 03 P      Roger. Standby.
00 01 28 10 P      Okay, Scott.
00 01 28 12 CC     Roger. 3-1 is 03 01 20.
00 01 28 18 P      Oh, back to 20 now.
00 01 28 19 CC     Roger.
00 01 28 21 P      Okay.
00 01 28 23 CC     6-1 is 08 51 33. Read those both back and give me
                             a standard report, please.
00 01 28 29 P      Will do. Okay. 3-1 is 03 01 20. 6-1 is 08 51 33.
00 01 28 41 CC     Right. The report, please.
00 01 28 42 P      Okay, stand by. I'll stow this pencil. I'm in
                             chimp configuration. The capsule is flying
                             beautifully. All thrusters are working well. The
                             gyro switch is normal. Maneuver switch is off.
                             All systems are green on green; and I'm bird-dogging
                             the dome temperature at this time on the
                             suit circuit.

	GYM-1

00 01 29 08  CC     Okay, Wally, give me your cabin dome and
                           cabin temperature. Also, your flow control
                           setting on cabin, too.
00 01 29 19  P      Okay. I have cabin temperature of 100 (degrees),
                           cabin dome, 40 (degrees); cabin heat exchanger
                           is 42 (degrees); the setting on the cabin is
                           3 and it's holding steady for a long period of
                           time. I'd rather not change that.
00 01 29 40  CC     Okay. And now your fuel and oxygen, please.
00 01 29 43  P      Okay. You want number?
00 01 29 44  CC     Roger.
00 01 29 45  P      Okay. The numbers on fuel 100 (percent) for
                           auto, 95 (percent) for manual, oxygen is
                           62 primary, 72 (psi, in hundreds) secondary.
00 01 30 01  CC     Roger. And on my mark the ground elapsed time
                           will be 1 hour, 30 minutes and 10 seconds.
                           Standby. MARK.<sup>T</sup>.
00 01 30 13  P      I am exactly 1 second slow. Correction, I am
                           1 second fast.
00 01 30 18  CC     Roger. Understand. One second fast, and looks
                           like you're good for another one, Wally.
00 01 30 24  P      Okay. And I saw some of John's friends up
                           here; I'm afraid to say, although I knocked
                           them off the way you did it. Ha! Ha!
00 01 30 33  CC     Roger. Interested in your report.
00 01 30 34  P      I imagine. John listening to some of that,
                           too?
00 01 30 38  CC     Roger.


	Page 44
	GYM-1

00 01 30 41  P     Basically, what I saw was the firefly color
                              that John saw, which I could create at other
                              times as white color. I'm definitely convinced
                              it's capsule - a capsule derivative and once in
                              a while, even now, I see one go by.
00 01 30 59  CC    Roger. That's good to hear.
00 01 31 02  P     I'm getting a very good yaw check with the yaw
                              reticle in the ASCS mode. Having no trouble
                              with that at all.
00 01 31 12  CC    Wally, are the particles luminous or reflecting?
00 01 31 16  P     Scott, I think they are reflecting. I'm going to
                              go ahead now, Scott, and do some yaw check as
                              long as I've got some good terrain to look at
                              and leave the particles off for a while.
00 01 31 27  CC    Okay. We are just about . . . losing T/M. We're
                              reading roughly 0, 0, and (-) 34 (degrees) at
                              this time.
00 01 31 38  P     Roger. Understand.
00 01 32 26  P     This is Sigma Seven. I am now commencing day yaw
                              checks. I am - Guaymas. Do you read? Over.
                              This is Sigma Seven. I'm going to send a blood
                              pressure at this time.
00 01 32 42  CC    Sigma Seven, Guaymas Cap Com. Reading you on HF.
00 01 32 47  P     Roger. I'm going to fly-by-wire low at this time.
00 01 32 52  CC    Roger. You're loud and clear on HF now, Wally.
00 01 32 55  P     Roger, Scott.
00 01 33 14  P     I moved my left arm too much on that last transmission.
                              I'll give another one a little later.
00 01 33 20  CC    Roger.

00 01 33 23  CC     Sigma Seven, Cape Cap Com. How do you read?
00 01 33 25  P      Hi, Deke, I read you loud and clear. How me?
00 01 33 27  CC     You're coming in fairly good.
00 01 33 32  P      This reticle is working very well for yaw, as well
                           as for almost any other attitude.
00 01 33 49  CC     Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, this is Cape Cap Com.
00 01 33 51  P      Go ahead, Cape.
00 01 33 55  P      Cape Cap Com, go ahead. Cape Cap Com this is
                           Sigma Seven. I read you loud and clear. How
                           me?
00 01 34 11  P      Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, Cape Cap Com.
00 01 34 14  P      This is Sigma Seven. Go ahead, Cape, I read you
                           loud and clear.
00 01 34 18  CC     You are coming in about 3 by.
00 01 34 20  P      Okay.
00 01 34 23  P      I'm okay. Standby, I'm going back to ASCS.
                           It's gotta hold me up (delay me.) The capsule
                           - I'd like to straighten out this problem
                           that you are - obviously have seen on the
                           suit circuit. I have had very little luck
                           in bringing it down. I'm going to increase
                           the setting to 8 at this time. I am on 8
                           now - the suit dome is now about 81 (degrees).
                           It has dropped about a degree. Do you
                           understand?
00 01 35 02  CC    Understand suit dome is 81 (degrees).
.

	Page 46
	CNV-2

00 01 35 07  P     That is correct. Suit dome is 81(degrees).
                           The suit inlet is about 76(degrees). I'm
                           making a little ground on it.
00 01 35 15  CC    That sounds promising.
00 01 35 16  P     Yeah, I think it is. I didn't want to rush
                           into it, and I didn't get too hot. I
                           know you are concerned. I'd rather come
                           up on the right setting than dicker around
                           going back and forth.
00 01 35 27  CC    Roger.
00 01 35 28  P     Now all the systems are working very well. I'd
                           like to give you a rundown on the control
                           systems. My fly-by-wire is excellent. Manual
                           was slightly sluggish but very good. The
                           capsule at this time is in auto mode, maneuver
                           off, gyros normal. T<sub>s</sub>+5 did check out very
                           well. The fuel is holding up as you can see, as
                           well as the oxygen.
00 01 35 57 CC     Okay, sounds good.
00 01 35 58 P      Okay. I'm going to continue with my day yaw
                           checks now.
00 01 36 02 CC     Next transmission will be on emergency voice.
00 01 36 06 P      Roger.
00 01 36 14 CC     Sigma Seven, Cape Cap Com, transmitting emergency
                          voice. Over.
00 01 36 18 P      Roger. I read you loud and clear. I'm going to
                          send you another ...(blood pressure) here,
                          because I moved too much on the last one.
00 01 36 27 CC     Roger.
00 01 36 52 CC     Seven, Cap Com.

00 01 36 54 P      Go ahead, Deke.
00 01 36 56 CC     Your (contingency recovery area)2 Bravo retro.
00 01 36 58 P      Standby 'till I finish my blood here. Okay,
                             I'm done. Okay, go ahead with your 2 Bravo.
00 01 37 11 CC     2 Bravo, 01 48 32.
00 01 37 15 P      48 32. Is that correct?
00 01 37 22 CC     01 48 32.
00 01 37 25 P      32 Roger. Understand. 01 48 32, 2 Bravo.
00 01 37 32 CC     We suggest you have a drink of water if you
                             haven't had one recently.
00 01 37 36 P      No, I haven't. I've tried not to open the
                             visor. I want to get the circuit going down.
                             I think we might have a chance to take a quick
                             one. I'll get ready for one.
00 01 37 46 CC     Okay. If you're reading this, I want to clear
                             you on one item.
00 01 37 49 P      Okay.
00 01 37 51 CC     You indicated high thruster action at Bermuda
                              and Muchea on switch over from ASCS to fly-by-wire.
                              Has this been apparent to you?
00 01 38 01 P      Negative. It has not. I have one case where
                              I went into reeentry attitude after -
                              correction, before - Canton but this was to
                              check the stars at night after Woomera.
                              And I got a twitch then, which I think was a
                              high thruster.

00 01 38 20  P      Otherwise, it dropped in beautifully on
                          transition from control mode to control mode.
00 01 38 28  CC     You're pretty poor transmitting, let's try
                          UHF once.
00 01 38 32  P      Okay. Standby, VOX off.
00 01 38 58  CC     Seven, Cap Com, UHF. How do you read?
00 01 39 12  P      Deke. I read you loud and clear. How me?
00 01 39 14  CC     How you reading now?
00 01 39 17  P      I read you fine. I just had some water and it
                          does feel kinda good.
00 01 39 21  CC     Roger, loud and clear.
00 01 39 25  P      Say again.
00 01 39 26  CC     Looks more readable on UHF.
00 01 39 27  P      Okay. We'll use that around the pad.
00 01 39 33  CC     Have some Echo sighting data for you if you're
                          interested.
00 01 39 38  P      Yeah, I'd like to hear about it.
00 01 39 40  CC     In the second orbit over Zanzibar, time 15 23
                          Zulu. Azimuth should be 2.30 (degrees),
                          elevation 83.25 (degrees).
00 01 39 59  P      Roger, we'll see if we can take a peek at it.
00 01 40 04  CC     Our recommendation is that you decrease suit
                          valve to position 3 and observe dome temperature
                          for 15 minutes. If this doesn't help,
                          then go back to 7.


	Page 49
	CNV-2

00 01 40 15 P      Deke, I finally got a grasp on this thing. I'm
                             beginning to feel a little cooler. And the
                             suit inlet temperature is now down to 76
                            (degrees). Over.
00 01 40 26 CC     Roger, understand you would prefer to maintain
                             a status quo, is that correct?
00 01 40 30 P      No, I've been sneaking up on this thing for
                             almost a whole orbit.
00 01 40 36 CC     Roger.
00 01 40 38 P      Do you understand?
00 01 40 39 CC     Roger.
00 01 40 53 P      Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven.
00 01 40 56 CC     Go ahead.
00 01 40 57 P      I really do feel I am getting cooler. The
                             suit inlet is now about 75 to 76 (degrees),
                             so I am making progress. Over.
00 01 41 08 CC     Roger, understand. You are getting a slight
                             decrease.
00 01 41 09 P      That is affirmative. I would rather not
                             throw in the sponge on the settings I have
                             so far.
00 01 41 18 CC     Roger, understand. You would prefer to let
                              it stabilize a while longer.
00 01 41 21 P      Right. I'm going to go back to some more yaw
                              checks.
00 01 41 40 P      Going to fly-by-wire low.
00 01 41 44 CC     Fly-by-wire low.
00 01 41 45 P      Roger.

00 01 42 05 P      Go ahead, Deke.
00 01 42 07 CC     Bermuda again shows high thruster action on
                          switch over to fly-by-wire.
00 01 42 12 P      I'm positive I'm not getting it, because if -
                          I'd be leaping all over - I'd be leaping
                          all over the sky if I were getting highs
                          at this point. I haven't used more than,
                          oh, 1/2 degree per second.
00 01 42 40  CC     Sigma Seven, Cap Com.
00 01 42 42  P      Go ahead Deke.
00 01 42 47  P      Go ahead Cape Cap Com.
00 01 42 50  CC     Roger, you are fading. We are about at LOS.
                          Flight would still prefer that you consider
                          going to position 3 after evaluating 8 a
                          while longer.
00 01 43 02  P      Roger. Understand.
00 01 43 07  P      Roger. I'm now getting into attitude. Standby
                          for 0 (degrees) yaw, and pitch and roll. This
                          will be - .
00 01 43 24  P     Yaw is now approximately 0 at this time - MARK.
<sup>T</sup>. I will look - about 4 degrees
                          left. Correcting in pitch, yaw is okay, going

                          out, gyros are normal at this time. I'm setting

00 01 48 52 P      Hello, Canary Com Tech, this is Sigma Seven.
                             I read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
00 01 48 57 CC     Roger, Sigma Seven, this is Canary Cap Com,
                             reading you loud and clear. We'd like to get
                             some temperature readings from you. Cabin
                             suit and cabin dome and suit dome. Over.
00 01 49 08 P      Okay, I'll give you a readout. Suit dome is 80
                             (degrees), suit inlet temperature is 75 (degrees),
                             cabin dome is 41 (degrees), cabin temperature
                             is 97 (degrees), suit coolant setting is 8,
                             cabin is 3. I will follow . . ..
00 01 49 40 CC     Do you feel that these settings now are giving
                             you adequate cooling.
00 01 49 44 P      I am going to take Flight's suggestion, and
                             reduce my setting to unit 3 for a few minutes,
                             and then try back at 7 if this does not work.
                             Over.
00 01 49 56 CC     Roger. I copied.
00 01 49 57 P      I am now going to setting number 3 on the

00 01 50 09 P      At 1 hour and 50 minutes.
00 01 50 12 CC     Roger. What is your present control mode?
00 01 50 23 P      I am in ASCS.I have completed yaw checks with
                             the window, I am going to try some yaw checks
                             with the periscope at this time.

00 01 50 34 CC     Roger.
00 01 50 39 P      Switching to fly-by-wire low, gyros free.
00 01 51 20 P      I can definitely see a yaw pattern in the
                          window, in the periscope, in the reticle.
                          The window itself is satisfactory at (-)
                          34 degrees, I've covered the gyro and am
                          now coming back to the left to remove yaw.
00 01 51 44 CC     Roger. Did you, how far did you have to come
                          back on yaw?
00 01 51 48 P      I am not there yet. I'd say about 25 to 30
                          degrees, I'm stopping yaw at this time. The
                          periscope checks with the window and the
                          reticle and I'm going to give a mark shortly,
                          to try to get all the rates stopped. I am
                          just about in retroattitude now, and yaw
                          looks real clean. I'm going to pull off and
                          look. It's about 1 degree of yaw, to the
                          right - MARK.<sup>T</sup>. Okay, I'm satisfied
                          with that kind of day yaw check. That
                          was done in retroattitude. I had a real good
                          cloud layer, that was what was the cue.
00 01 52 32  CC     Roger. How do you feel about systems at the
                          present time now?
00 01 52 33  P      All systems are green except for the suit
                          cooling and it definitely is - the dome
                          temperature is going up at this time. I'm
                          going to go back on ASCS for a while and hack
                          out a network.
00 01 52 52  CC     Roger.
00 01 52 56  P      I will not go to ASCS. Ah, by the way, how
                          about taking a look at my high thrusters.
                          Have you seen any high thruster action at all?
00 01 53 04  CC     Standby.
00 01 53 06  P      I shouldn't have had any at all.

                          back to 81 (degrees). The suit inlet went
                          up to 80 (degrees). I've got it back to 78
                          (degrees). I am back at the setting of almost

00 02 05 58 CC     Roger, I'm not reading you. I'm not
                          reading you. Very, very weak. Will
                          you report the suit control setting now,
                          and how do you feel?
00 02 06 12 P      This is Sigma Seven. I feel marvelous and
                           I have finally knocked suit control.
00 02 06 35 P      This is Sigma Seven. I had a slight case
                          of double authority here. I got very bored
                          with manual proportional during the drifting
                          period and forgot to put the rate command
                          switch to auto, . . .it's about one stroke
                          in pitch.

                            this time. Over.
00 02 12 18  P     Roger, I have good news. The suit dome
                            temperature is now 70 degrees. The suit
                            inlet temperature is now 70 degrees. Over.

                            know if you feel particularly hot.
00 02 12 57  P      No, I feel very comfortable. Did you read what
                            I've got for the suit temperature?
00 02 13 04  CC     Roger, understand.
00 02 13 18  CC     Sigma Seven, this is IOS Cap Com standing by.
                            Over.
00 02 13 22  P      Roger. I want you to read back what temperatures
                            I gave you on the suit dome and on
                            the suit inlet. Over.
00 02 13 30  CC     Roger, the suit temperature is 70
                            (degrees). The suit inlet temperature is
                            70. Over.
00 02 13 38  P      Roger, the dome is now about 63 degrees and
                            is holding fairly steady. I will monitor
                            it so it doesn't go too low.
00 02 13 50  CC     Roger, 63 (degrees), dome, holding steady.
                            Over.
00 02 13 54  P      Roger, I think we've got that problem licked.

00 02 14 54  P      Roger, everything is good here. Thank you
                            very much for waiting for me to come by
                            again.

00 02 16 32 P      IOS, this is Sigma Seven. I'm not sure
                        whether you realize but I have been in
                        auto mode retroattitude. Over.
00 02 16 58 P      At last we have solved the suit circuit
                        temperature problem. I can see why Scott
                        was concerned about this record position
                        only. There is no side tone as well. The
                        suit temperature at this time is - CET
                        2 17 20 MARK. (2 17 20)<sup>T</sup> - is 68 degrees
                        and I'm feeling marvelous. The suit dome is
                        about 72 degrees again. Apparently, it does
                        fluctuate, and we are going into the night
                        side at this time. I believe we have the
                        suit circuit under good control. I will go
                        back to VOX push-to-talk. Standing by for
                        Muchea at 25 (minutes). Gotta watch one
                        sunset.
00 02 17 55 P      Sunset is rather striking, I don't think that
                        I need to waste much time looking at them.
                        They are very interesting. The other thing,
                        it's fascinating is how black it is when your
                        eyes are not adapted. I definitely can see
                        some coating on the window. Going back to
                        VOX at this point in UHF-hi to transmit.
                        Opening visor to wipe off the right microphone.
                        I licked it. Closing visor. Visor was sealed
                        immediately for the suit circuit to go to work
                        for me. I don't want to get fouled up with
                        it again. The suit inlet is holding very
                        nicely at about 68 (degrees). So the dome again
                        is going to go back up. It's now up at 76, 75
                        (degrees). Apparently this higher setting
                        is the one we want. Think I'll put in another
                        half a mark on that now and we may have her
                        locked. She's getting kinda cool at last so
                        I know where I want to go with the setting.
                        I have set the coolant quantity for the suit
                        and control lever at 8.5 at 2 hours 19
                        minutes, 28 seconds. The readout the dome
                        at this time is 75 (degrees).


	Page 63
	IOS-2

                              The suit inlet is 68 (degrees). Very
                              pleasant. I can feel cool air crossing
                              my face. The oxygen quantity looks real
                              good, 60 and 75 (psi, in hundreds).
                              I have been watching the 250 inverter.
                              It is approaching 140 degrees, and the
                              150 contrast is down to about 100
                              degrees. Standby is about 100 (degrees)
                              which is cabin temperature. Thirdly,
                              the 250 - that one's suffering, and I
                              will keep an eye on it. Cabin heat
                              exchanger is definitely settling out at
                              40 degrees, and its given me a hard time
                              because I obviously owe Frank Samonski
                              50 cents. I'm pleasantly surprised.
                              Cabin fuel too, is reading a little high.
                              Let me see now, we're carrying 5.5 psi.
                              it's reading about 5 point, correction,
                              5.3, that's not too high for this cabin.
                              It's getting nice and dark out, I think
                              I'll take a peek out at the stars at
                              this point. The cover for the battery
                              for the flashlight on the left glove
                              is coming loose. Only where - where
                              the switch is, is no problem, just a
                              case of wearing out before they should.
                              Drifting, checking my wrist watch as a
                              backup and I have 2 hours and 51 minutes.
                              Correction, that's 2 hours and 21
                              minutes. Check that, 2 hours and 21
                              minutes and 35 seconds. Right on.
                              We're not too bad, we better get a CET check
                              at Muchea on this trip.
00 02 22 25  P     Going for the computer. Clock is reading about
                              2 hours and 23 minutes. We'll say 2 24.
                              At 2 24 we should pick up Muchea, also pick
                              up a yaw check. 2 24 we have 05 36 on the
                              other set.

00 02 23 13 P      Perth should be coming into view and it should
                          be - oh, what a beautiful yaw check this is,
                          and it's approximately 10 degrees left of
                          path. Better make that about 12 degrees left
                          to path. Just on the edge of the window, and
                          that should give us 0 (degrees) yaw. I cannot
                          see anything through the periscope that would
                          help me. It is too - it is too cloudy. I'm
                          coming out on VOX 1, 2, 1, 2. VOX is now
                          coming in very well.

00 02 24 03 CC     Sigma Seven Sigma Seven this is Muchea Cap
                          Com. How do you read? Over.
00 02 24 07 P      Muchea, this is Sigma Seven. Read you loud
                          and clear. How me?
00 02 24 11 CC     Read you loud and clear, also, Wally. How
                          about a standard report.
00 02 24 15 P      Okay, Gene, I'll give you the suit thing
                          first so everybody is off the hook. We
                          have a dome on the suit of 72, that is
                          dome temperature (degrees). I have a
                          suit inlet of 66 (degrees) on the suit and
                          the suit setting is 8 and I am very happy
                          with the suit circuit at this time. I am
                          very comfortable.
00 02 24 43  CC     Roger. Cape advises they are very happy with
                          the whole situation at this time. Particularly,
                          the ECS systems solved itself, and they seem
                          to think you have a good handle on the whole
                          situation there.
00 02 24 55  P      Roger, I lost it for a while when I went back
                          to the 3 setting, but I didn't stay there
                          very long. It definitely should be about
                          7-1/2 to 8. At this point, I am on ASCS
                          auto retroattitude. I am going to go to
                          fly-by-wire shortly. I had been on gyros
                          normal, and maneuver has been off.


	Page 67
	MUC-2

                            All systems are green. I snapped off
                            about 2 percent of manual (fuel) one time
                            by hitting RSCS. It was double authority.
                            It was my boo-boo. It was just one pitch
                            down motion.
00 02 25 34 CC     Roger. Understand and stand by.
00 02 25 37 P      Okay, I would like to go ahead with my night
                            yaw check on fly-by-wire low.
00 02 25 42 CC     Roger. We'll stand by.
00 02 25 44 P      Okay. Now I'm using the moon which is to
                            the left of me, and it's a real good fix for
                            it. I'm just gonna go ahead and cover up the
                            attitude indicator and you can watch the yaw.
                            I'm going to gyros free, trying to select
                            to fly-by-wire low at this time. I'm gonna
                            put the moon in the center of the window first -
                            and holding roll and pitch and then put the
                            moon back where it belongs. The moon is
                            approaching the center of the window at this
                            point. Okay, I'm gonna stop it there, and
                            we'll put the roll control in to get that
                            balanced out. Okay, at this point, I will
                            get 0 roll. I have overshot the moon and am
                            picking up the planet Mercury which is nice
                            and bright, and that's a little bit far to
                            the right. Now take a check off and we'll
                            see how many degrees we've got here in yaw.
                            About 20, which is enough for a quantitative
                            check. We'll bring her back now. And I
                            have to go ahead with slight roll motion each
                            time I do this. This is to track the horizon
                            naturally.
00 02 27 06 CC     Roger. Understand.
00 02 27 11 P      Okay, we're coming to the right as you may be
                            able to see, and we're coming around very well.
                            I still have to correct my roll out. Coming
                            up on yaw attitude very shortly here. I'm


	Page 68
	MUC-2

                           quite satisfied with both day and
                           night checks. I've been real pleased
                           with it. I have to say this has been
                           a real treat to see these bears flow
                           into place.
00 02 27 39  CC    Roger, everything checks out just as you say
                           on the ground indication, Wally.
00 02 27 44  P     Okay, I'm gonna give you a mark on the moon
                           now for a yaw reference. I would say this
                           is now zero yaw. MARK.<sup>T</sup>.
00 02 27 56  CC    Fine. We had a -4 on the ground. That's
                           pretty good.
00 02 27 59  P     -4. Okay, I'll check here. Looks about right.
                           I could have come right a little bit more.
                           Okay, that's about all I need for the night
                           yaw checks, and, as far as I'm concerned,
                           I'll go back and give the guys some more
                           ASCS time. I don't see any reason to burn
                           up too much fuel. Now I'll give one you one of those
                           things for your Sir John.
00 02 28 26  CC    Roger. Understand. There's a few lights on at
                           . . .. Can you see anything?
00 02 28 33  S     We seem to be getting reasonable body temperatures
                           now, Wal.
00 02 28 36  P     Oh, very good. Warren, nice to hear from you,
                           old man.
00 02 28 40 S      Me too. How are you, Sand Groper?
00 02 28 41 P      Oh, great sport. Understand some suds are on
                           the way back.
00 02 28 50 P      I might as well look down and see if you fellows
                           have got some lights on. I'm gonna kill the
                           blood pressure.

00 02 28 55  CC    Shannon runs out of fuel, . . . he doesn't
                             get bogged down in the sand.
00 02 28 59  P     Ha! Ha! I still have black skid marks on
                             my swim fins from your trip into the bush.
                             Okay, you can see I've yawed right again.
                             I need to come - correction, yawed left. I
                             need to come right, the moon is right on the
                             horizon. I'll put it right on again, just to
                             show you how easy it is to acquire. I seem to
                             be holding up on my fuel minimum so I'll go
                             ahead and play with it a little bit here. Okay,
                             we're just about on in yaw, and still off in roll.
                             I'll slap her in and we'll have it made. Here
                             comes roll to straighten her up. Coming up on
                             roll - okay, I'm quitting right there. That's
                             about as good as I'll ever give you. Little
                             off in roll here. There we go. Now, that's
                             what I would give you. Okay, I'm gonna go back
                             to gyros normal, and let them come back on the
                             line. I'm going to set up now and uncover the
                             instruments for chimpanzee configurations.
                             Dammit, I'm sorry, auto mode.
00 02 30 13  CC    Roger. I understand.
00 02 30 15  P     I broke my promise.
00 02 30 22  CC    We had you on a +5 (degree) roll when you
                             uncovered.
00 02 30 26  P     Right, that's about right. Oh! I've got
                             some lights down there. How about that?
00 02 30 33  CC    Good, that's us.
00 02 30 34  P     That's a great deal. Sure thank you-all. I've
                             got a washer in here. I captured a washer and
                             a little piece of metal and this looks like
                             sort of a conical washer like a Voishan type
                             or something, better not be.

00 02 30 50 CC     Fine - can you give us another blood pressure.
                            That one cut off a little too soon.
00 02 30 54 P      Okay, let me get back into configuration here.
                            I'm going to ASCS at this time. And she
                            walked in without any high thrusters, I believe.
                            Will you double check that? And for that, I'll
                            give you a blood pressure.
00 02 31 09 CC     Roger.
00 02 31 11 P      Got to check the Sanborn I guess, for that one.
                            Coming up on BPMS. Gene, I'm real pleased
                            with the suit temperature now. I've got a
                            real steady 65 (degrees). Although the
                            dome is reading just about 70 (degrees) as a
                            steady number.
00 02 31 37 CC     Roger. 65 and dome 70.
00 02 31 39 P      Right. The cabin is just sitting here fat,
                            dumb, and happy, I haven't had to do a thing
                            to it. Now, have you been watching my 250
                            inverter?
00 02 31 54 CC     I've got 55 (degrees) on the ground.
00 02 31 57 P      I've got 140 (degrees) here. And the trend
                            has been very slow building up. I don't think
                            I'll change the cold plate settings. The
                            150 is holding about . . ..
00 02 32 08 CC     This is Muchea - recommend you go over to
                           Woomera.

00 02 32 10 P      Roger. Woomera Cap Com, Sigma Seven. Over.
00 02 32 15 CC     Sigma Seven, Woomera Cap Com. Loud and clear.
                            Over.

	WOM-2

00 02 32 18  P     Roger. Nice to be back over Woomera.
00 02 32 21  CC    Same here. And . . ..
00 02 32 22  P     I'm a little bit . . ..
00 02 32 23  CC    . . . mode.
00 02 32 24  P     Okay.
00 02 32 25  CC    . . . condition.
00 02 32 26  P     Roger. I am in ASCS auto, in other words a
                              normal mode. Gyros are normal, maneuver is off,
                              all systems are green. I'm real happy with
                              the suit circuit at this time.
00 02 32 41  CC    Roger. We received your last reports from
                              Muchea and is that auto retro?
00 02 32 46  P     That is auto retro. Would you give me a time
                              hack at 33 minutes. Over. That's 2 hours,
                              33 minutes.
00 02 33 06  CC    You want to get your blood pressure stopped?
00 02 33 08  P     Roger. Can you read me?
00 02 33 10  CC    Affirmative, we are reading you.
00 02 33 12  P     I need a mark on capsule elapsed time. Your
                              ground elapsed time, give it to me at 30
                              seconds.
00 02 33 20  CC    Roger.
00 02 33 26  CC    5, 4, 3, 2, 1. MARK 02 33 30.<sup>T</sup>
00 02 33 34  P     Roger. I read 31. I'm 1 second fast. That's
                              very good.


	Page 72
	WOM-2

00 02 33 39 CC     Your T/M readout on your capsule elapsed time
                          occasionally reads out 1 second fast and then
                          comes out to be correct with our time, then
                          it gains a second again.
00 02 33 50 P      Welcome to the Quiver Club.
00 02 33 52 CC     Roger.
00 02 33 55 P      Okay, I think I gave you some good old blood
                          for that one. Thanks for the swap.
00 02 34 02 S      Roger, that was the stop button. The stop
                          button, we're still getting it.
00 02 34 07 P      Okay, I'll stop her.
00 02 34 09 S      Roger.
00 02 34 10 P      I'll try to give you the full bit.
00 02 34 13 S      Thanks.
00 02 34 14 P      You were so nice asking for it. I had to give
                          it to you.
00 02 34 17 S      We meant the stop button.
00 02 34 20 P      Oh, for gosh sakes, I gave you a whole new
                          one.
00 02 34 23 S      Ha! Ha! It never quit.
00 02 34 25 P      I see.
00 02 34 26 S      Looks good now.
00 02 34 27 P      Good show. Okay, I feel happy about the fuel
                          condition. We've got - I'm reading 95 (percent)
                          auto, 90 (percent) manual. What are you reading?


	Page 73
	WOM-2

00 02 34 38  CC    Reading 98 auto and manual 94.
00 02 34 46  P     Well, how about that.
00 02 34 48  CC    Beautiful.
00 02 34 50  CC    Okay, Spacecraft Commander, this is Woomera
                              Systems. Do you have any high thruster actions
                              during your last pass over Woomera and Muchea?
00 02 34 59  P     I don't think so, because I was just cruising
                              over you that time in fly-by-wire low and
                              ASCS. I had one . . ..
00 02 35 06  CC    Z Cal jumped down here and indicated high thrust.
                              We think that was probably erroneous.
00 02 35 14  P     I'm quite sure it was, because I would have
                              noted it rather rapidly. I made one large
                              thrust application in the flight so far,
                              where I was going back from manual proportional
                              to fly-by-wire and I forgot to
                              move the rate command switch to auto. I had
                              one pitch function and you really know it.
                              So if I had a high thruster, I'm sure I would
                              have known it.
00 02 35 37  CC    Roger.
00 02 35 38  P     Very good. Thanks for looking out for me.
00 02 35 43  CC    Everything looks green down here.
00 02 35 45  P     Oh, it's great up here.
00 02 35 47  CC    Standing by.
00 02 35 48  P     Righto. I'm seeing a lot of your lightning
                              now.
00 02 35 53  CC    Yeah, we got a bunch.
00 02 35 54  P     I'll bet you have. Sorry I couldn't see your
                              flare just - I thought I saw, but it's just
                              lightning all the time.


	Page 74
	WOM-2

00 02 36 03  CC    Maybe next time.
00 02 36 05  P     Okay. I see Africa. Looks pretty good down
                           there. We'll give them a whack at it.
                           Don't give up though, I think the flare will
                           help us some day.
00 02 36 19  CC    We'll let Gordo take a look at it.
00 02 36 23  P     Right. I'm gonna do a little star gazing now.
00 02 36 29  CC    Woomera has T/M LOS.
00 02 36 30  P     Roger, Woomera.
00 02 36 34  CC    Sigma Seven, Woomera.
00 02 36 36  P     Go ahead, Woomera.
00 02 37 38  P     There's the old Corona Australis, shows in
                           beautifully, and we've got Nunki. We've
                           got Kaus Australis, and Nunki is right on
                           the flight path where it belongs. I'm
                           reading 0 yaw, 5 degrees left roll, in
                           retroattitude. I sure would like to know
                           why it's so complicated. And up above
                           those boys I should pick up another brighty.
                           That must be, has to be Altair. Very good.
                           You actually get the feeling that you aren't
                           really going over Australia on this flight.
                           Okay. Now let's see, we finished yaw
                           check for those boys, coming up on Canton.
                           They get more ASCS than they reckoned for
                           this time.
00 02 38 53 P      That's right, on HF at 3 plus 20, everything
                           else is in order. Take another look at that
                           dome there, over there. Suit temperature is
                           64 (degrees) and I'm really happy.
00 02 39 20 P      T<sub>r</sub>-10 back to normal. I've done that earlier.
                           Okay, we got - got suit pressure. Go ahead


	Page 75
	WOM-CTN-2

                              and take a look at the inverters again
                              here. 250 is 141 (degrees), 150 is about
                              107 (degrees). Well enough alone. Standby
                              is . . . 7. Just about ambient. Negative,
                              it's even a little . . .. The cabin pressure
                              is about 5.3 (psi), which is perfect. Suit
                              dome is 72 (degrees). Cabin dome is 45
                              (degrees) and cabin is holding. Suit temperature
                              is about 64 (degrees) and I like it.
                              Oxygen is 60 (psi, in hundreds). Cabin O<sub>2</sub>
                              is 5.3 (psi), and a complete electrical.
00 02 41 00  P     All batteries are reading about 23½ (volts)
                              or higher, ammeter is just about steady at
                              20 amps. Wanted to check before we power
                              down, ASCS is 115 (volts). Fans is about
                              115 (volts), standby 0 (volts). Okay, the
                              cockpit is clean. It's obvious that that
                              damn antenna situation is no good. Just brought
                              HF back in bicone again.

                              Tech. Over.
00 02 42 12  P     This is Sigma Seven, I read you loud and clear.
                              How me?

                           by. Over to Cap Com. Over.
00 02 43 52 P      Roger, I'm here too.
00 02 43 57 CC     Sigma 7 this is Canton Cap Com. Over.
00 02 44 00 P      Roger, Canton. All right I'll give you a short
                           report. I am in auto retro mode, gyros
                           normal, maneuver off, all systems are green,
                           suit circuit is under positive control.
00 02 44 26 CC     Roger, Can - Roger, Sigma Seven.
00 02 44 30 P      This is Sigma Seven. I am ready at this time
                           for a retrosequence if required. All I have
                           out is one star chart and that's it.
00 02 44 43 CC     Roger, Sigma Seven.
00 02 44 45 P      And you'd better not give me one. Ha, Ha, Ha.
00 02 44 50 CC     Say again, Sigma Seven.
00 02 44 51 P      I don't want one. Ha. Ha.
00 02 44 53 CC     Roger.

00 02 44 55  P    She is really performing like a jewel right
                 now.
00 02 45 03  CC   Say again, Sigma Seven.
00 02 45 05  P    I said she is performing like a little jewel.
00 02 45 08  CC   Roger, that's great.
00 02 45 10  P    Now, the only thing we had trouble with so
                 far is the suit circuit, and we've got that
                 pretty well licked.
00 02 45 17  CC   That's what I understand from listening over the
                 Goddard conference (network communications loop).
00 02 45 20  P    Now, just for your briefing, I've got a suit
                 inlet (temperature) now of about 63 degrees,
                 and the dome is holding steady, at 70 degrees.
00 02 45 33  CC   Roger, understand.
00 02 45 34  P    I'm perfectly  comfortable. I'm gonna quit
                 with that thing while I'm ahead.
00 02 45 39  CC   Roger.
00 02 45 44  P    Some of that reason that I've lost HF
                 communications, I believe, is that I keep
                 bumping that switch from dipole to bicone.
                 You understand?
00 02 45 54  CC   You say you keep bumping the switch from
                 dipole to bicone?
00 02 45 59  P    That is correct. So on the HF check here,
                 I'm set up for it. I think we can probably
                 get a good one this time.
00 02 46 06  CC   Roger.

00 02 46 07  P     That's at 3 hours and 20 minutes, of course.
                            Apparently I've got to keep checking that
                            thing for bicone. Correction - for dipole.
00 02 46 17 CC     Roger, understand.
00 02 46 20 P      I just have to move my elbow to the right,
                            and I knock it.
00 02 46 24 CC     I see.
00 02 46 28 P      It's not critical. It's just a way of doing
                            business. I had compared the night yaw checks
                            over Muchea and Woomera, and am very satisfied
                            with the results. With known objects it is
                            absolutely no problem at all to acquire yaw.
                            In addition, we can watch . . . down through
                            the window.
00 02 46 47 CC     Roger, that's what I heard. I heard your report
                            at Woomera.
00 02 46 53 P      Roger. There is nothing new up here, then.
00 02 47 02 CC     Roger. We have nothing. No questions here.
00 02 47 06 P      Roger. Apparently, the 250 inverter is not
                            going up very much. My reading is still
                            remaining about 140 degrees.
00 02 47 19 CC     Roger.
00 02 47 33 P      I guess Frank Samonski knows I owe him a half
                            a dollar by now.
00 02 47 38 CC     Roger.
00 02 47 53 P      For your information, because you can't read
                            it, my retro (package) temperature at this
                            time is 72 degrees.
00 02 48 01 CC     Roger. Understand 72 degrees.

00 02 48 05 P      That is correct.
00 02 48 06 CC     Thank you. Seventy-two degrees.
00 02 48 09 P      Seventy-two degrees for the retro heater.
                             Retro rocket rather. There are no heaters.
00 02 48 49 P      I'm opening the visor just for a moment to
                             scratch my nose.
00 02 48 55 CC     Roger.
00 02 48 56 P      And closing visor. I missed on that, I'm
                             gonna have to reseal that. Okay, it's re-sealed.
                             I'd just as soon not stay on that
                             cabin any longer than necessary.

                             clear. How me?
00 02 49 46 P      Hawaii Com Tech. This is Sigma Seven, read
                             you loud and clear. How me? Over.

00 02 49 52 P      Hi, Gussie, how ya' doin'.
00 02 49 56 CT     Sigma Seven, Hawaii Com Tech.
00 02 49 59 P      Hawaii Com Tech, Hawaii Cap Com, this is
                             Sigma Seven. I read you loud and clear.
                             How me?
00 02 50 04 CC     Sigma Seven, this is Hawaii Cap Com. How do
                             you read?

	HAW-2

00 02 50 09  P      I read you loud and clear.
00 02 50 15  P      Hawaii Cap Com, I will start a standard
                           report for you. I am in auto retroattitude.
                           I have gyros normal, maneuver off, all
                           systems are green, and go for the next orbit.
                           Over.
00 02 50 37  CC     Roger, Wally. Understand all systems are
                           green and go. We indicate you have a go
                           down here.
00 02 50 44  P      Roger.
00 02 50 45  CC     Could you give me a CET, please?
00 02 50 47  P      Roger. Standby for a mark at 50. MARK 50.
<sup>T</sup>. That's 2 hours 50 minutes
                           plus 50 seconds.
00 02 50 52  CC     Roger. We indicate you're 1 second fast.
00 02 50 56  P      Roger, Gus. I think everybody's got the reading
                           on the suit circuit, I won't bother bringing
                           that up anymore.
00 02 50 59  CC     Roger. I'd like to have a cabin temperature
                           and a cabin dome temperature.
00 02 51 04  P      Okay. Cabin temperature is 97 (degrees).
                           The dome is 45 (degrees).
00 02 51 08  CC     Say again dome temperature.
00 02 51 17  P      45.
00 02 51 20  CC     Roger. 45.
00 02 51 22  P      And the setting has not been changed for a long
                           time.
00 02 51 26  CC     Roger.

	Page 81
	HAW-2

00 02 51 27  P     I have not changed the setting on the inverters.
                            I'll give you a recap on those. Inverters are
                            at 4. That's the (coolant control) valve
                            setting. The cabin is at 3. The suit is at 8.
00 02 51 43  CC    Roger.
00 02 51 45  P     And it's working all very fine. I've got about
                            62 (degrees) inlet now on the suit.
00 02 51 52  CC    Would you push your blood pressure stop button,
                            Wally?
00 02 51 56  P     Roger.
00 02 52 01  P     Now you don't have to ask me for it, you have to
                            tell me to stop. This is horrible. Ha!
00 02 52 06  CC    I'd rather ask you to give it.
00 02 52 08  P     I liked your dispatch the other day. It helped.
00 02 52 14  CC    I almost forgot. Aloha, from Hawaii.
00 02 52 16  P     Oh! Aloha.
00 02 52 24  P     Got some real good night yaw checks, Gus. It
                            just slops right in.
00 02 52 28  CC    Roger.
00 02 52 29  P     And, your reports on manual proportional, just
                            about right. The tail-off is what you see
                            more than anything else. It's a little
                            sluggish.
00 02 52 51  CC    Wally, Cape seems to think you're in good shape
                            also.
00 02 52 53  P     Roger. I feel fine. This old bird is really
                            performing up here.


	Page 82
	HAW-2

00 02 52 59  CC   Good show.
00 02 53 25  CC   Wally, give me a reading on your attitudes
                    now.
00 02 53 29  P    Okay, I am rolled left about 7 degrees. Yaw
                    right 2 degrees. Pitched up about 4 degrees.
00 02 53 41  CC   Roger. Pitch up 4 degrees.
00 02 53 43  P    That's affirmative.
00 02 53 45  CC   Roger.
00 02 53 46  P    We have a ± 5½ degree envelope on this
                    one, Gus.
00 02 53 51  CC   Roger.
00 02 53 59  P    She's tracking beautifully. I haven't had a
                    thruster one problem. Really nice.
00 02 54 05  CC   Roger. Give me your pitch attitude again,
                    Wally. We don't agree with that.
00 02 54 09  P    Okay, I have an indicated (-) 30 degree pitch,
                    and it checks with the window just about
                    right on the button, Gus.
00 02 54 18  CC   Okay, Roger. I misread you then.
00 02 54 21  P    I'm sorry I said + 4, I was going up from
                    the retro mark which would probably confuse
                    you.
00 02 54 29  CC   Yes, you did,
00 02 54 30  P    I can imagine.
00 02 54 31  P    Okay, I'll read them out the way I see them
                    instead of the way the SEDR (Service
                    Engineering Department Report) boys do it.

                            I'm getting the old fireflies again.
                            I guess John is relieved. I haven't
                            been looking for them - they're just
                            there.
00 02 54 49 CC     Okay.
00 02 54 52 P      They're just freebees. You can see some
                            big ones and some little ones. They're
                            almost impossible to photograph. Most
                            of them are of a less magnitude than I'd
                            say a good star. Every once in a while
                            you see some of the big ones.
00 02 55 08 CC     Do you see them close to you?
00 02 55 11 P      Oh, yeah, you can actually see relative motion,
                            Gus. You can see them right by the window,
                            then have them drifting way away. Looks like
                            you see them way out because the velocity
                            between you and fireflies is definite.
00 02 55 27 CC     Roger. Wally, I think we're losing you.
                            Will you stand by for California?
00 02 55 31 P      Okay, Gus. I want to talk about this to John.
                            He's the one that's been waiting. I guess
                            we're gonna have them all the time.
00 02 57 54 P      Sunrise over the West Coast. It is rather
                            disappointing because it is just about
                            socked in completely; smog and cloud conditions.
                            I am seeing breaks as I approach the coast
                            line. Someday, I'll get a flight across the
                            Pacific without clouds underneath me.
00 02 58 26 P      The attitudes check out very well. No doubt
                            about it. Yaw can be seen with the periscope.
                            And it can be acquired very rapidly. It can
                            also be seen through the window without any
                            device.
00 02 59 05 P      Covering up the periscope again. Standing by
                            for John.

                           read?
00 02 59 19 P      Cal Cap Com, Sigma Seven. Loud and clear.
                           How me?
00 02 59 22 CC     Roger, loud and clear, Wally. Looks like
                           things are leveling off pretty good up
                           there. Looks like it's going fine now.
                           You got a status report?
00 02 59 28 P      Yes sir. I'm real happy with this bird.
                           I am in ASCS auto mode, retro attitude, I
                           have gyros normal, maneuver off, all
                           systems are green. I've got the suit
                           circuit under control as you probably
                           know by now, and a delightful report for
                           one John Glenn. I do see fireflies.
00 02 59 52 CC     Good boy.
00 02 59 54 P      And they were your color, John. That was
                           a very good description. Although during
                           the bright side, if I rap them, they're
                           definitely white. While on the sun center
                           sunrise, they come out the true firefly
                           color you described.
00 03 00 16 P      John, did you read all that?
00 03 00 18 CC     This is Cal. Now reading you very weak, Wally.
                           You faded after that first good transmission
                           there. I got that you were seeing the fireflies
                           and then you faded out on your description.
                           Repeat please.

00 03 00 29  P     Okay. How do you read me now?
00 03 00 31  CC    Loud and clear again.
00 03 00 32  P     Okay, we're back on UHF-hi. They were
                              definitely the fireflies that you described
                              at sunrise. I haven't been looking at
                              sunsets particularly. As we get brighter,
                              for example, now when I'm in the daylight and
                              I rap it, I get white crystals which look like
                              ice.
00 03 00 53  CC    Roger, got that all okay. Understand as
                              described at first, and they got whiter as you
                              go into better light.
00 03 00 59  P     Right, I've got white ones right now that are
                              sort of drifting around. Look like little
                              bits of frost.
00 03 01 05  CC    Roger, sounds good. Are you read to copy
                              (recovery area) 4-1 retrosequence? Over.
00 03 01 11  P     Roger, go ahead John.
00 03 01 13  CC    Roger. Incidentally, you have a go for the
                              next orbit in case you were wondering. Cape
                              concurs with that one. Your retrosequence
                              time for 4-1 is 04 32 36. Over.
00 03 01 25  P     32 36.
00 03 01 26  CC    Roger. 04 32 36. And Cape advises just proceed
                              with normal flight plan. Looks like things
                              are going fine.
00 03 01 33  P     Yeah, I feel real happy with everything. I
                              stopped everything to get a hold of that
                              suit circuit and that seemed to fix it up.
00 03 01 40  CC    Roger, that had everybody concerned for a
                              while, but looks like it is in good shape now.

00 03 01 44 P      I was sure everybody was jumping up and
                            down on that one.
00 03 01 46 CC     You were right.
00 03 02 09 P      It's kind of hard to describe all this,
                            isn't it John?
00 03 02 12 CC     Yeah, it sure is, Wally. Can't describe it.
00 03 02 16 P      No, - real, real thrill.
00 03 02 20 P      Too bad you're all socked in.I hope to
                            see you pretty soon though.
00 03 02 24 CC     Haven't even looked outside.
00 03 02 25 P      Ha, Ha, Ha. That was my problem when you were
                            going over.
00 03 02 32 P      I guess you heard my yaw reticle is working
                            out very well.
00 03 02 36 CC     Yeah, that's real good. Glad to hear it.
00 03 02 54 P      I definitely did detect some fogging on the
                            window from the tower rocket, John.
00 03 03 00 CC     Roger, got that. Some fogging on the window
                            from the rocket.
00 03 03 04 P      Yeah.
00 03 03 12 P      I'm gonna try your idea on pitch technique
                            here for drifting. I think that'll be fun.
00 03 03 18 CC     Say again, Wally, didn't get it.
00 03 03 19 P      I'11 try your technique on the drifting period
                            for this orbit by using - I think that will be
                            a lot of fun. I just had a hole out here with
                            an island. Looks like that might have been
                            San Clemente, I'm not sure. Yeah, I'm over
                            land now.

00 03 03 39 CC     Roger.
00 03 03 40 P      I'm getting a good sight of the U.S.A.
                              We just got the typical California
                              fog belt behind me and looks like I'm
                              getting a watch at the Salton Sea, I
                              believe.
00 03 03 53 CC     Roger. That's where Scott and I both
                              picked up loud and clear over here.
                              Seems to be always clear back in there.
00 03 03 59 P      Yeah, just as soon as you get over the ridge
                              line.
00 03 04 03 P      I don't see anybody water skiing today. Is
                              it cold?
00 03 04 08 CC     Not that cold.
00 03 04 10 P      Ha, Ha, Ha.
00 03 04 44 P      That's about as far north as I can see is the
                              Salton Sea. You get a real good look at
                              Baja California. And I probably can see
                              Guaymas loud and clear, the way it seems.
00 03 04 56 CC     Looks like you have pretty good visibility
                              today, if you see all that area.
00 03 05 00 P      Yeah, I can see just about as far as the
                              Salton Sea north. I can see the Mt. Whitney
                              area, but not much of it for the snow
                              capped peaks that are just about on the
                              horizon now.
00 03 05 15 CC     Right.
00 03 05 16 P      And I can see with a little craning, around
                              almost the southern tip of the Baja
                              peninsula.

00 03 05 25 CC     Sounds like you've got a real good view
                            today with not much cloud cover up there
                            over a lot of it.
00 03 05 30  P     No, just the coast is all that's socked in.
                            The rest of it's CAVU (clear and visibility
                            unlimited). As long as I get some ASCS
                            time I can look. I've got some roads down
                            here that are pretty obvious to me right on
                            the flight path. I'm really talking to you
                            for a long way, John.

00 03 06 22  P     Muchea Com, correction - Guaymas, Sigma Seven.
00 03 06 26 CC     Roger. Go ahead Sigma Seven.
00 03 06 28  P     Okay, Scott, things are going real well up
                            here. Gonna get a grip on that coolant
                            system, and your comment was very valid.
                            If a guy has time, he can usually work
                            it out.
00 03 06 41  CC    Roger, Wally, you faded out at the last.
                            Understand everything is good up there,
                            you have another good trip.
00 03 06 48  P     Right, I think I had a good look at your station
                            going over.
00 03 06 51  CC    Roger, understand.

00 03 07 10  P      Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven. Over.
00 03 07 21  CC     Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven. Cape Cap Com.
00 03 07 24  P      Roger, Deke. I'm on push-to-talk at this
                            time. How do you read? Over.
00 03 07 29  CC     Roger. Reading you 5 by.
00 03 07 30  P      Roger, this is UHF-hi.
00 03 07 33  CC     Roger.
00 03 07 34  P      Going to VOX.
00 03 07 40  P      Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven. On VOX
00 03 07 42  CC     Roger. You're good on VOX.
00 03 07 44  P      Okay. I'm sending you one. Control mode
                            is ASCS; auto retro; gyros normal; maneuver
                            off. All systems are green. I'll give you
                            a readout on the domes here, if you'd like.
00 03 08 11  P      Cape Cap Com. Sigma Seven.
00 03 08 13  CC     Sigma Seven. Cape Cap Com.
00 03 08 15  P      Did you read the report?
00 03 08 17  CC     I read the report. Awaiting the dome temperature
                            particularly suit.
00 03 08 20  P      Okay. Suit dome is 70 (degrees). Cabin
                            dome is 45 (degrees). That blasted cabin
                            heat exchanger is 40 (degrees). Suit
                            inlet is 62 (degrees), and I'm very
                            comfortable.
00 03 08 38  CC     Excellent.
00 03 08 40  P      Are you ready for me to make a power down
                            yet?


	Page 90
	CNV-3

00 03 08 43  CC     Very good. Would you give us all three
                             inverter temperatures at your leisure.
00 03 08 49  P      Okay. I'll give you those, and then I'll
                             power down.
00 03 08 52  CC     Roger.
00 03 08 53  P      250 is 143 (degrees). It's gone up
                             about 2 degrees in the last 40 minutes.
                             The 150 is about 105 (degrees). The
                             standby is about, ha, 110 (degrees)
                             I'd say. A little warmer.
00 03 09 12  CC     Roger.
00 03 09 13  P      And the retro heaters, the retropackage
                             temperature is about 74 (degrees), and
                             it's stayed there almost all this time.
00 03 09 21  CC     Roger. That's very good.
00 03 09 22  P      Okay. I'm gonna go into a power down.
00 03 09 25  CC     Roger. Understand.
00 03 09 26  P      I'll give a readout on how I do it.
                             Selecting fly-by-wire. Going to gyros
                             caged. Judging gyros caged. I'm
                             going to 0.
00 03 09 44  CC     Roger.
00 03 09 45  P      Going to ASCS bus, turning it off, and
                             that's 0 volts. And am I clear to kill
                             my beacon?
00 03 09 56  CC     Affirmative.
00 03 09 57  P      Okay. Beacon off. The rates are . . ..
00 03 10 03  CC     Hit your blood pressure stop button, we're
                             still getting BP.


	Page 91
	CNV-3

00 03 10 06  P     Yeah, instead of getting asked for it, I'm
                            gotta asked to stop it now.
00 03 10 11  CC    That's a welcome changeover.
00 03 10 13  P     There go the beacons off.
00 03 10 15  CC    Roger.
00 03 10 16  P     I caught your Z Cal. Okay, the rates
                            are nice and zeroing. I'm going back to
                            normal position instead of fly-by-wire.
00 03 10 28  CC    Roger.
00 03 10 29  P     Gyros are caged, and the VOX is off. I'm
                            going to select reentry for the attitude,
                            so I got that set up for the powering-up
                            procedure.
00 03 10 38  CC    Very good.
00 03 10 40  P     Okay, I've got fly-by-wire low, and the
                            normal on the ASCS mode, auto, gyros
                            caged, maneuver is still off. And the
                            bea - and the beacons are off. Here she's
                            cruising along very happily.
00 03 11 01  CC    Very good. Are you ready for a (contingency
                            recovery area) 3-C retro (time)?
00 03 11 03  P     Say again.
00 03 11 04  CC    Are you ready for your 3-C retro time?
00 03 11 08  P     I'm sorry. You're very garbled.
00 03 11 12  CC    Are you ready for your 3 Charlie retro
                            time?
00 03 11 15  P     Okay. I'll try to get it from you, Deke.
                            I - you're garbled, say them very slowly.
00 03 11 20  CC    03 39 36.


	Page 92
	CNV-3

00 03 11 26 P      Okay. You came in loud and clear.
00 03 11 28 CC     All righty.
00 03 11 29 P      03 39 36 for 3 Charlie.
00 03 11 35 CC     That's affirmative.
00 03 11 36 P      Okay.
00 03 11 39 CC     Let me give you a GMT time hack, see how we
                           are there at this time.
00 03 11 42 P      Yeah. That's probably all fouled up. Okay.
                           You give it to me.
00 03 11 46 CC     On my mark, I'm 15 27 00 - MARK.<sup>T</sup>
00 03 11 52 P      27?
00 03 11 54 CC     Affirm.
00 03 11 55 P      Holy Malone! That's got a, okay, that thing
                           is, really a pile of gabog. I've got 24.
00 03 12 05 CC     . . ..
00 03 12 07 P      Well, let me try that GMT on my back-up
                           clock here. Any time.
00 03 12 15 CC     Want a mark on the back-up?
00 03 12 17 P      Yeah.
00 03 12 19 CC     Okay. 03 12 25 on my mark. - MARK.<sup>T</sup>
00 03 12 30 P      That was 15 47 30. Is that correct?
00 03 12 36 CC     I gave you a mark on CET, CET.
00 03 12 40 P      Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry, I was looking at my
                           back-up.
00 03 12 43 CC     Okay.

00 03 12 45 P     Let's try for CET again at 50 (seconds).
00 03 12 47 CC    Roger, in 3 seconds. MARK.<sup>T</sup>
00 03 12 52 P     Okay. I am a second and a half fast.
00 03 12 53 CC    Very good.
00 03 12 55 P     GMT - of 28 coming up, actually, I've
                         passed it.
00 03 13 01 P     Give me 28 15.
00 03 13 05 CC    MARK.<sup>T</sup>
00 03 13 07 P     Very good, I'm about 3 seconds slow on the
                         back-up. That's the best one.
00 03 13 14 CC    . . ..
00 03 13 15 P     Say again.
00 03 13 17 CC    Roger. Did you see Echo?
00 03 13 19 P     Negative. I could not get to it. I was
                         trying to conserve some more fuel there,
                         and couldn't get pitched up in the right
                         attitude for it.
00 03 13 27 CC    Roger. How about Mercury?
00 03 13 30 P     Mercury? Loud and clear. I used Mercury and
                         the moon for my night yaw check.
00 03 13 37 CC    Roger.
00 03 13 38 P     No, this thing has, ah, practically no rates
                         indicated, Deke, but I'm now, I'd say rolled
                         over, oh, probably 30 degrees to the left. -
                         Pretty close to pitch attitude, and of course
                         it's pretty hard to tell what yaw is under
                         these conditions.
00 03 13 58 CC    Roger. Eat and drink - you're also fading.

00 03 14 04 P     Okay. I think I'll try some of that.
00 03 14 06 CC    Roger. We'll leave you alone for awhile.
00 03 14 09 P     Okay. That might be fun, too. I'm now going
                          to go ahead and do an orientation test.
00 03 14 13 CC    . . ..
00 03 14 14 P     Okay. Thank you.
00 03 14 31 P     Okay. On the orientation test. - I touched
                         the manual lever; I touched the clock, a
                         rivet above the clock at about 10 30 just
                         between the clock face and the yaw indicator.
                         On the emergency rate lever, I touched it
                         right on the button.
00 03 14 53 CC    You're coming in garbled. You must have your
                         mouth full
00 03 14 55 P     No. I'm just, ha ha, I'm talking about my
                         orientation test.
00 03 15 01 CC    Roger.
00 03 15 16 P     Okay. We finally got the right scale for this. -
                         I've got to go to VOX record. Got the right
                         scale for the dosimeter - and it is reading -
                         about, less than 0.1, exactly 0.04. I am
                         now putting the dosimeter back on the hatch -
                         which is the lowest scale reading.
00 03 16 00 P     I'm back on VOX transmit now. Do you read,
                         Deke? I've ended up with a beautiful 90
                         degree roll to the left. Boy, what a nice
                         eight-point roll this is. Coming up for
                         HF reception. Going to transmit HF, VOX off.
00 03 16 38 CC    Sigma Seven. Cape Cap Com. Do you read? We
                         are approaching LOS.
00 03 16 59 P     This is Sigma Seven broadcasting on HF. Deke,
                         how do you read this now?

00 03 18 30 P    It should be noted that the ammeter is reading
                         12 amps as advertised - apparently, somebody
                         is getting to me with a R Cal on the cabin
                         0<sub>2</sub>. The ammeter is just about exactly on
                         12 amps.
00 03 18 56 P    There is a slight rate in yaw about ½ degree
                         per second, it's almost impossible to take
                         out without having to fly it out. This does
                         look like an appropriate time to get ready
                         for an HF check. Turning the VOX to push-to-talk.

                         is a smoked pattern with streaks of light.
                         Powdery debris on it - some of it has a
                         pink color, sort of a pinkish-orange color.
                         Probably from the RTV 90 sealing devices
                         that were around the rings and sealing

00 03 26 06 P     Very good.
00 03 26 14 P     At this point, I definitely have a feeling
                         of flying along yawed, 90 degrees, rolled
                         right 30 degrees, and pitch almost right
                         on the horizon.
00 03 26 30 CC    Roger. Sigma Seven. I did not read.
00 03 26 33 P     Roger. I have a slight yaw rate about a

                       well as transmitting, naturally, and I appear
                       to be yawing right around into proper yaw

00 03 27 33 P     In VOX record. I've just checked the stick out -
                         while in drifting flight - to see if I would
                         get any rates built up by stroking the stick,

00 03 52 08 P     On the powering up. I went to gyros normal,
                         finally, after getting gyros set at approximately
                         three zeros with the maneuver off.
                         There was no high thruster transition. Then,
                         when I set up for three zeros, I did get a
                         high thruster transition in the reentry
                         select attitude. However, this is probably
                         due to the no rate gyro run up case.
00 03 52 41 P     I am flying at three zeros on ASCS mode at
                         this time, to see if this helps me reestablish.
                         At approximately 4 hours, I just find out
                         where I am as far as the moon goes.
00 03 52 56 P     Having little trouble getting stars oriented as
                         to which ones they are, and this is going

                         This doesn't help one bit.

                         while to find out. Read the computer,
                         set up, 3 hours and 53 minutes, and the
                         time at 55, set up to a standard - 56
                         minutes . . . standard . . ..

00 03 59 33 P     That's affirmative. I just used the moon to lock
                         on. I will give you a short report. I'm just
                         going to go on the ASCS . . . if you watch my
                         thrusters.

00 03 59 45 CC    Roger.
00 03 59 50 P     I will go on ASCS; reentry attitude.
00 03 59 55 CC    Roger. You're on now according to us.
00 04 00 02 P     Roger. I'm just about going in. I'm not on it.
                         Ha. Ha.
00 04 00 12 P     Okay. I'm going in it now, on gyros free. I'm
                         going to go to gyros normal.
00 04 00 21 P     Okay, Gene. I'll give you a readout on what
                         we've got up here.
00 04 00 24 CC    Okay.
00 04 00 31 P     First off, I'm in auto reentry; I'm in auto;
                         gyros are normal; maneuver is off; all
                         configuration is of reentry; bypass switch
                         for rate gyros is in normal. Give you a
                         fuel readout, the auto tank is 90 (percent),
                         manual is about 90 (percent). Give you a
                         read on the suit which has been very
                         comfortable now. The suit temperature is
                         60 (degrees). My dome is down to 45 (degrees).
                         I'm going to back it off a half a notch. I'll
                         go to 0 and then come back up again. Over.
00 04 01 18 CC    Okay, Wally. Stand by.
00 04 01 27 S     Sigma Seven. How about blood pressure?
00 04 01 33 P     On the way.
00 04 01 36 CC    Roger. John Glenn suggests that you have time
                         when the numerous particles first appear, at
                         sunrise, to tap the side of the capsule, and
                         test his favorite theory.
00 04 01 57 P     Roger. I have done that Gene, and they do come
                         from the capsule.


	Page 103
	MUC-3

00 04 02 03 CC    Roger. And he suggests later on, when they appear
                         like white particles, that you do the same and
                         this might prove that they are the same particles.
00 04 02 11 P     I tried that too.
00 04 02 13 CC    You got the same result?
00 04 02 14 P     That's affirmative.
00 04 02 15 CC    Roger.
00 04 02 43 CC    Sigma Seven. If you're not doing anything, can
                         you give us an attitude readout.
00 04 02 47 P     Okay. My indicated attitudes are 0 degrees
                         pitch, 10 degrees left yaw, 0 degrees roll.
                         Over.
00 04 03 07 CC    We concur. Very good.
00 04 03 09 P     Roger. How do the scanners look?
00 04 03 21 CC    Within 4 degrees, Wally. They are consistent,
                         also.
00 04 03 26 P     Roger. I think I got the bear lined up pretty
                         well, then.
00 04 03 30 CC    Roger. Everything looks very good here. You
                         sound very good, and it looks like go for 6.
                         I think from here I'll just ask the doctor
                         in.
00 04 03 39 P     Okay.
00 04 03 41 S     How do you feel?
00 04 03 42 P     Very good. I'm enjoying the ride very much.
00 04 03 46 S     Excellent.
00 04 03 54 P     You can tell Chris I got bored racking around
                         and I just decided to give him his auto retro.
                         Actually auto reentry attitude at this point.
                         Over.

00 04 04 27 CC    Sigma Seven. Woomera Cap Com.
00 04 04 30 P     Hello, Woomera. Go ahead.
00 04 04 35 CC    Sigma Seven. Woomera Cap Com. Did you say
                         you were going to auto retro?
00 04 04 41 P     Negative. I'm in auto reentry at this point.
00 04 04 45 CC    Roger. We received your Muchea report, and
                         we're standing by.
00 04 04 51 P     Roger, Woomera. Thank you.
00 04 04 57 CC    What is your comfort control valve suit setting?
00 04 05 03 P     Roger. It is now set at 7.5. I went back to 0
                         and came back up again. Over.
00 04 05 15 CC    (Roger.)<sup>G</sup> Would you repeat that last part?
00 04 05 17 P     Say again?
00 04 05 19 CC    We received you going to zero, but we didn't
                         know what it was set at.
00 04 05 24 P     Roger. 7.5.
00 04 05 26 CC    (All systems)<sup>G</sup> green at Woomera.
00 04 05 29 P     Roger. My suit dome is 62 degrees at this time.
00 04 05 37 CC    Suit dome 62 (degrees).
00 04 05 38 P     Correct.
00 04 05 41 CC    Thank you. You . . ..
00 04 05 50 CC    You reported the suit dome at 45 (degrees) over
                         Muchea. Is this correct?
00 04 05 55 P     That's correct. It moved that fast.

00 04 05 55 CC    (Good.)<sup>G</sup>
00 04 06 28 CC    We are about to have LOS here at Woomera.
00 04 06 32 P     Roger.
00 04 06 33 CC    Anything else for the Cape?
00 04 06 35 P     Negative. Everything's going along fine
                           here.
00 04 06 39 CC    Roger.
00 04 08 29 P     Roger. At this period, I'm looked ahead at
                           the flight plan. I frankly feel that a lot
                           more star information is needed, for nailing
                           down attitudes - or a better computer. I'm
                           rapidly working here when I shouldn't have
                           to be.
00 04 11 20 P     At 4 11, it is 1 15 on the star chart computer, . . ..
00 04 11 30 ?     . . ..
00 04 11 44 P     I have Jupiter off on the right side, right
                           corner of the window.
00 04 12 07 P     . . . Altair
00 04 12 15 P     I can see the double stars of Grus all forming
                           a line - coming right into the center
                           of the window. Jupiter, of course, is a
                           real bright one. I can see Ankaa and -
                           correction Al Naiir, and that, this must
                           have been Peacock. Al Naiir is slightly
                           to the right of the flight path. I'm
                           flying, but that must be her. Jupiter
                           shows up in the corner of the window.
                           Proper head position, Formalhaut shows
                           up to the right of flight path. Jupiter
                           in the right corner. It checks at this
                           time. Very nice.
00 04 15 21 P     . . ..

00 04 15 58 P     Don't tell me this compass is working? I
                          should talk more. What I have been doing, I
                          have been getting the standard source of
                          light out. At this point, for the capsule,
                          for my face because I am looking straight
                          up at the compass is really rolling in the
                          plane of the roll axis. I have a North
                          pointing toward my right elbow. The compass
                          definitely takes a swing when I moved
00 04 17 32 P     The compass is too much affected by the attitude
                          instruments and gyros behind them.
                          That's why I can't bring it to close to
                          them. I am holding it just about halfway
                          between the instrument panel and my face
                          and in reference to a line halfway between
                          the glove box and the pack. At the CE time
                          of 4 18, it is pointing directly at the
                          forward hatch clamp line. It seems that
                          this is the restraining pin link for the
                          hatch. I guess they can stow that for
                          future reference.
00 04 18 57 P     . . . get rid of that for awhile.
00 04 19 04 P     We are on time 4 hours and 19 minutes. On
                          ASCS and I will pinch down. At this point,
                          going to fly-by-wire low - to reentry
                          attitude for Hawaii.
00 04 19 35 P     Selecting reentry attitude.
00 04 19 45 P     Always surprising when you finally see some
                          object and the rate really shows up.
00 04 20 09 P     I am stopping the capsule in reentry attitude.
                          Taking roll out. Yaw is zero; roll is
                          coming out. I want to acquire this, and
                          then watch it. Roll looks good. Pitch is
                          coming in; yaw is coming in. Rates and
                          attitude are good, . . . ASCS a little low
                          thruster tweek and very nice. I will warm
                          up the T<sub>r</sub>-10, gyros for their benefit. And
                          starting to get some light on the scope,
                          just barely.


	Page 107
	WOM-HAW-3

00 04 21 49 P     I have a feeling I am off in pitch, but I think
                         it is that damn horizon air glow line. Makes
                         you think it's higher than it is. I still
                         have the feeling though that I am pitched down
                         about 10 degrees further than I want to be.
                         If we are that close, we will let the scanner
                         work on the problem.
00 04 22 44 P     Now we are indicating retroattitude. We are
                         fairly close to it. So the scanners are
                         torquing it up about 5 degrees I'd say.

	HAWAII

00 04 22 55 CC    Sigma Seven. Hawaii Cap Com.
00 04 22 59 P     Roger. Hawaii Cap Com this is Sigma Seven.
                         How do you read?
00 04 23 02 CC    We are reading you okay now. How about giving
                         a short report?
00 04 23 06 P     Okay, good. I am in ASCS; retroattitude; gyros
                         are normal; the maneuver switch is off. I
                         am warming up the T<sub>r</sub>-10 bypass for the rate
                         gyros. I still have fly-by-wire low selected.
                         All quantities and systems are green. I am
                         green.
00 04 23 31 CC    Roger. Could you give me your cabin dome
                         temperature, and cabin temperature, and valve
                         setting.
00 04 23 38 P     Roger. The suit dome is 68 (degrees). The
                         cabin dome is 48 (degrees). The suit setting
                         is 7.5. The cabin setting is 3. Over.
00 04 23 59 CC    Roger. Give me your cabin temperature, suit
                         temperature, and inverter setting.
00 04 24 04 P     Okay. Cabin temperature is 92 (degrees), and
                         I'll give you inverters. Stand by. - Main
                         inverter is, 250 inverter is about 143
                         (degrees). The 150 is 102 (degrees). Standby
                         is about 115 (degrees).

00 04 24 28 CC    Wally, I cut you out there. Give me your
                         water valve setting on your inverter.
00 04 24 33 P     On the inverter it is 4.
00 04 24 38 CC    Roger.
00 04 24 40 P     That seems to work pretty well so far for the
                         whole flight, Gus.
00 04 24 43 CC    Okay fine. Cape feels you are in good shape
                         Wally, and so I have good news. They give
                         you a go for 6 orbits.
00 04 24 48 P     Hallelujah.
00 04 24 51 CC    They request you stay in retroattitude, and
                         go ahead and prepare for retro like you
                         would normally.
00 04 24 58 P     I understand.
00 04 25 00 CC    And remain in retroattitude until you pass
                         your (recovery area) retro 3-1 time.
00 04 25 04 P     I understand.
00 04 25 06 CC    And then proceed with your flight plan.
00 04 25 08 P     Okay, Gus. I will see you out there shortly.
00 04 25 11 CC    Roger.
00 04 25 45 P     These attitudes look honest as can be, Gus.
00 04 25 48 CC    Roger.
00 04 25 52 P     How do the scanners check out with you?
00 04 25 55 CC    You're looking real good down here, Wally. We
                          can see nothing wrong.
00 04 25 57 P     Good deal. I use the moon and then later on
                         Jupiter to line up some of the other stars.
                         A little too dim to bet on every time.

00 04 26 07 CC    Roger.
00 04 26 11 P     The star computer device I have helps a lot to
                         confirm stars, but it's a little hard to
                         acquire them to begin with.
00 04 26 19 CC    Roger.
00 04 26 30 CC    I guess the only thing I don't have is your
                         suit inlet temperature. Could you give me
                         that?
00 04 26 32 P     Roger, 62 (degrees).
00 04 26 35 CC    62 (degrees). That sounds good.
00 04 26 37 P     Yeah. It's been very comfortable since I
                         finally got that final setting.
00 04 26 41 CC    Roger.
00 04 26 45 CC    How much water have you had Wally?
00 04 26 47 P     I took a big sip awhile ago, and then I just
                         had a tube of peaches and a couple of those
                         cubes.
00 04 26 53 CC    Okay. Good,
00 04 26 54 P     Now it looks like a good time to take a
                         drink of water, over you.
00 04 26 54 CC    Visor open?
00 04 27 15 P     My visor is open now.
00 04 27 18 CC    Roger. Visor open.
00 04 27 52 CC    Wally, give me your pressure . . . readout.
00 04 27 56 P     Just a second Gus, I am trying to stow this
                         water hose.
00 04 27 59 CC    Okay.

                          and I am back on the suit again.
00 04 28 21 CC    Roger.
00 04 28 23 P     That is actually as pure as we normally
                          would have it. That is why I didn't want
                          to stay on too long.
00 04 28 29 CC    Roger. Check your visor close.
00 04 28 32 P     Roger. The visor is closed and sealed up.
                          Suit visor bottle is way up in the green.
00 04 28 40 CC    Roger.
00 04 29 09 P     Well Gus. We - at least we got some fuel coming
                          over here this time.

00 04 32 12 CC    Sigma Seven. Cal Cap Com,
00 04 32 14 P     Cal Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. Read you.
                          Do you read me? Over.
00 04 32 18 CC    Roger. Read you loud and clear, Wally. Looks
                          like it is all go for a next orbit. Do you
                          concur?
00 04 32 25 P     Roger. Everything feels good here, John.
00 04 32 32 CC    Roger. Standing by for your report.
00 04 32 34 P     Roger. I am in ASCS auto at this time; in
                          reentry attitude; the gyros are normal;

	CAL-3

                         maneuver is off; all systems are green. Auto
                         fuel is 89 (percent), manual is 90 (percent).
                         My temperatures at this point are very
                         comfortable. The suit inlet is 62 (degrees),
                         the dome is 69 (degrees). I believe I am
                         all set to power down. Over.
00 04 33 12 CC    Roger. That's next on the flight plan here.
                         You are all set to power down if you concur.
                         And I would like to check your clock setting.
                         What do you have on the clock there? Over.
00 04 33 21 P     Okay. I will give you a mark at 30 seconds.
00 04 33 24 CC    Your ECT I have here, what's your setting for
                         retrosequence. Over.
00 04 33 27 P     Roger. 08 hours + 50 + 21.
00 04 33 32 CC    Roger. Thank you.
00 04 33 38 CC    What is your cabin pressure, Wally?
00 04 33 40 P     Roger, the cabin pressure is just about 5.1
                         (psi).
00 04 33 45 CC    Okay. Sounds good.
00 04 33 47 P     Right. Not much time for that one for this
                         orbit is there John?
00 04 33 56 CC    What? Say again please?
00 04 33 57 P     There wasn't much time to get ready for
                         coming down, coming down this time was there?
                         Sorry I couldn't go back to Hawaii for you
                         this way. I'll see you out there, I guess.
00 04 34 09 CC    Wally, yeah right here at the end of six. Do
                         you have any comment with regard to relative
                         motion of those particles that you saw? Did
                         you see any of them moving past, or did you
                         see any of them coming toward you if you were
                         facing in the direction of flight? Over.


	Page 112
	CAL-3

00 04 34 23 P     I never had the direct opportunity of them
                         coming toward me John, but they definitely
                         were going away from me. I could get a
                         big blast of them, either green fireflies
                         or white ice crystals, by rapping on the
                         capsule almost anytime.
00 04 34 38 CC    Roger. If you happen to have a chance at
                         sunrise, anytime between now and end of
                         flight, you might see whether you can see
                         any coming toward you during that period
                         also.
00 04 34 47 P     Roger. Understand.
00 04 34 49 P     Okay. I am going to shove off for a relaxation
                         period.
00 04 34 53 CC    Good show. Understand you are going to power
                         down.
00 04 34 55 P     That's affirm. I'll give you a readout on
                         it, so you can watch it.
00 04 34 56 CC    (Roger)<sup>G</sup>
00 04 35 03 P     Going to fly-by-wire. Going to gyros caged.
00 04 35 09 CC    Roger.
00 04 35 11 P     Gyros are three zeros at this time. ASCS bus
                         off. I have 0 volts.
00 04 35 23 P     Roger. Powering down the beacons, ground
                         command.
00 04 35 26 CC    T/M's dropped.
00 04 35 27 P     Roger. I have 12 amps at this time.
00 04 35 31 CC    Roger. That's what we show.
00 04 35 32 P     Roger. Okay I am going from fly-by-wire back
                         to normal now, so I can keep a cold stick.
00 04 35 42 CC    Roger.


	Page 113
	CAL-3

00 04 35 44 P     Okay. I am in normal, and I am going to
                         select reentry attitude select for powering
                         up time.
00 04 35 59 P     And she's all set.
00 04 36 17 CC    . . . this is Cal, you are looking good.
                         . . . see you next time around.
00 04 36 21 P     Right'o John, and thanks so much for your
                         help.
00 04 36 23 P     Roger.
00 04 36 35 P     At 04 36 37. I took a light reading, and the
                         light value is 13 for ASA 160.
00 04 36 47 CC    Roger. Got it.
00 04 36 51 P     I'll see if I can flounder around with the
                         camera now and get a picture of the Baja.
00 04 36 57 CC    Roger. I understand getting a picture of
                         Baja California.
00 04 37 00 P     I am just breaking out the camera now, John.
00 04 37 02 CC    Okay, very good.
00 04 37 03 P     Right. I'm sure I'll be ready for it though.
00 04 37 49 P     Okay. Setting in 11 - and we can look down
                         towards the Salton Sea again - on infinity.
00 04 38 02 CC    Yeah. That's a pretty good setting from up
                         there.
00 04 38 04 P     Yeah. . . . actually, I am looking north of
                         the Salton Sea because of the yaw effect
                         I must have in here. There is just a
                         slight yawing effect just left of the
                         capsule. Maybe about a quarter of a
                         degree per second. Enough to bring me
                         up towards the U.S.A.


	Page 114
	CAL-3

00 04 38 44 CC    Roger. Understand. Little slow yaw rate
                          to the left. You are beginning to fade a
                          little bit here. Probably won't get you
                          much longer.
00 04 38 51 P     Okay. I'm yawing to the right. Sorry I
                          misled you.
00 04 38 55 CC    Roger.
00 04 40 10 P     Going to VOX record.

00 04 40 14 P      Roger. Standby 1 second Deke.
00 04 40 41 P      Roger. Made a dosimeter check, and it is still
                            less than the last reading.
00 04 40 46 P      Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven in UHF-hi. Go ahead.
00 04 40 59 P      Cape Cap Com, this is Sigma Seven, UHF-hi. Go ahead.
00 04 41 04 CC     Go ahead, Sigma Seven, this is Cape Cap Com.
00 04 41 10 P      Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven UHF-hi. How do you read?
                            Over.
00 04 41 13 CC     You are now coming in about 4 by.
00 04 41 17 P      Roger. I am in drifting mode, everything is working
                            beautifully.
00 04 41 24 CC     . . .
00 04 41 26 P      Say again.
00 04 41 29 CC     . . .
00 04 41 33 P      You are coming in garbled Deke.
00 04 41 35 CC     Here are your retro times, if you are ready.
00 04 41 38 P      Roger. I think I will be through in a second. I
                            will take them.
00 04 41 41 CC     Roger.
00 04 41 45 CC     (Recovery area) 4-2 is 05 44 05.
00 04 41 53 P      Do that one over again and I will be right on.
                            You're in clear now.
00 04 41 57 CC     Okay  4-2 is 05 44 05.
00 04 42 04 P      Okay. 4-2 is 05 44 05.
00 04 42 09 CC     Right. (recovery area) 6-1 is 08 51 24.

00 04 42 14  P     24.
00 04 42 16  CC    (Contingency recovery areas) A and B are nominal
                           and I'd like to give you a GMT hack and see
                           what your clock is doing now. Give you one at
                           16 57 35. MARK.<sup>T</sup>
00 04 42 28  P     Roger. I'm reading 55 45.
00 04 42 31  CC    Pretty good.
00 04 42 32  P     Let's check the backup clock and we will hack that.
00 04 42 35  CC    Roger.
00 04 42 37  P     Anytime.
00 04 42 41  CC    For your information, we are going to start calling
                           you Venus. IOS visually sighted you on the last
                           pass.
00 04 42 49  P     How about that?
00 04 42 52  CC    Did you have your steak?
00 04 42 54  P     Yeah. Did you?
00 04 42 56  CC    Yeah. It was okay. Did you eat it?
00 04 42 59  P     Would you do me a time hack again on GMT?
00 04 43 02  CC    Okay, GMT. 16 58 15. MARK.<sup>T</sup>
00 04 43 08  P     15 okay. I'm 15 - that was just about 3 seconds
                           slow on my backup clock.
00 04 43 15  CC   Very good. Flight would like to talk to you now.
00 04 43 17  P    Okay.
00 04 43 19  CF   Wally, we have some Echo sighting data. You prepared
                          to copy?
00 04 43 24  P    Just get my pencil out. Standby. Okay, go Chris.

00 04 43 28  CF   00 17 30 is contact time for 4 minutes. Azimuth
                            99.5 (degrees), elevation 90 (degrees). Echo
                            will be in the light, the capsule in the dark.
00 04 43 46 P     That should be fun, shouldn't it?
00 04 43 47 CF    Roger. Been a real good show up there. I think
                            we are proving our point old buddy.
00 04 43 52 P     I hope so Chris. I am enjoying it.
00 04 43 55 CF    Roger.
00 04 44 09 CC    Sigma Seven . . . standing by.
00 04 44 12 P     Roger.
00 04 44 34 CF    Sigma Seven, Cape Flight.
00 04 44 35 P     Okay, Flight.
00 04 44 38 CF    We are ready to go into fast time if you are.
00 04 44 40 P     Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! That's a good one. Very good.
00 04 45 08 CF    Sigma Seven, Cape Flight.
00 04 45 10 P     Go ahead there Chris.
00 04 45 12 CF    The . . . retrosequence now shows 08 51 21 which
                            means you can advance it exactly 1 minute and
                            that would be the correct time. You can do that
                            anytime you want to.
00 04 45 25 P     Advance it 1 minute?
00 04 45 28 CF    Affirmative. That would be 08 51 21.
00 04 45 32 P     Okay. I will throw a minute in now. You reading
                            me alright?
00 04 45 36 CF    Affirmative.
00 04 45 37 P     Okay.
00 04 45 44 P     . . . That's a trick. Okay, I got 08 51 20 . I'll
                            throw another second in. I've got 08 plus 51
                            plus 21.

00 04 45 46 CF    Roger. We concur.
00 04 46 00 P     Roger.
00 04 46 01 P     Ah boy, I just happened to drift into an inverted
                          position right now. For some reason or another,
                          you can tell that the bowl was upside down.
00 04 46 56 P     Cape Flight, Sigma Seven.
00 04 47 00 CF    . . .
00 04 47 04 P     You can tell Cape Sir John that we have practically
                          nothing on the navel engagement.
00 04 47 27 CC    Sigma Seven, this is Cape Cap Com, we did not get
                          your message to Sir John.
00 04 47 31 P     Roger. Never mind.
00 04 47 33 CC    . . . Cape Cap Com.
00 04 48 24 P     I took picture 4, - 4a at 4 48 29, which is the
                          coast of United States. I assume - I will
                          have to look at my map shortly and see where we
                          are. A rather large cloud mass at this point.
                          We will stow the camera again. The drift
                          rate isn't consistent enough that you can just
                          take a picture and then put the camera away.
                          Plus, the camera is a little hard to take
                          out and put back in again.
00 04 49 23 P     At 4 hours and 50 minutes, I can't get that
                          camera back out of that box again. Time to
                          take a picture. Better stay in there for
                          awhile.
00 04 50 01 P     Camera will not work in (to) the glove box
                          favorably.
00 04 50 21 P     Reading at light value 13-½, and a . . . inside.
00 04 50 36 P     . . . .
00 04 50 51 P     I punched the wrong button twice. I did not
                          get a picture of the iris.


	Page 119
	CNV-4

00 04 50 57 P     I am just about straight down. We will take
                            some cumulus pictures. The time hack is
                            4 hours 51 minutes. The picture will be
                            a 5a color.
00 04 52 13 P     The dome (temperature) is holding at 70 degrees.
                            Cabin dome is 50 degrees. Suit inlet is
                            comfortable at 62 (degrees). Suit pressure
                            is steady at 5 psi. Very interesting cloud
                            formation for picture 6b on the color back.
                            Rather nice collection of circular clouds.
00 04 52 46 P     . . . shot at 250 56. (1/250 second at f 5.6).
00 04 53 52 P     At 04 53 53. Bit of in a rolled over attitude
                            with the nose fairly high. . . . the light
                            value (setting) was 13.
00 04 54 17 P     I can actually see the little object that looked
                            like a snowflake this time, going away from
                            the capsule. In the same flight path, of
                            course. Definitely, looked like a piece of
                            white, but it is quite visible against the
                            black sky that I see now. . . . the stars
                            that go away from us. Definitely has a
                            different velocity than the capsule itself.
00 04 55 29 P     4 55 and still am sighting some of the snowflake
                            effects. 250 inverter is now approximately
                            135 degrees. Suit dome (temperature) is 72
                            (degrees). The cabin dome is about 46 (degrees).
00 04 56 47 P     Sun right in view again. . . . that should be
                            the proper yaw angle, approximately, because
                            that's where the sun would be at sunset.
00 04 57 02 P     Coming up on 5 hours, so I'll be getting
                            prepared to copy the intermediate report
                            at this time. I will not put the camera
                            all the way in the case at . . .
00 04 57 44 P     . . .
00 04 58 21 P     Capsule is working very well at this point.
                            250 (inverter) is 132 (degrees), 150 (inverter)

                          is . . . 5. Standby (inverter) is 120 . . .
                          thrusters . . . right, over 100 (degrees)
                          left. Pitch down (thruster) is 105 (degrees).
                          Pitch up (thruster) is 100 (degrees). Cabin
                          heat exchanger (setting) is 4.0. Roll left
                          manual (thruster)is 79 (degrees). Roll
                          right auto (thruster) is 110 (degrees), roll
                          left auto (thruster) is 105 (degrees). Think
                          we will go back and pick up the retro.
                          Temperature is 80 (degrees). This is at almost
                          exactly 5 hours.
00 04 59 59 P      Ready for the 5 o'clock report. Fuel is 89-90
                          (percent). Oxygen 56-75 (psi, in hundreds).
                          Suit inlet is . . .. Dome (temperature)
                          is 70 (degrees). Cabin dome (setting) is
                          . . . 0.8. That should be enough for now.
00 05 00 50 P      Got more targets of opportunity.
00 05 00 59 P      At 5 hours and 1 minute I am shooting pictures
                          of weather almost vertically. There is a
                          light value of 13-½. Gives me 250 and
                          5 6 (1/250 second and f5.6) roughly. Infinity
                          is the setting.
00 05 01 46 P      Light value of 13 for that same subject. I
                          shot at 13-½. Seems like a very low setting.
00 05 03 00 P      If I don't talk much more than this, it won't
                          be very long to real time this tape recorder.
                          Coming up on IOS at 5 hours and 15 minutes.
                          Quite obvious that you don't care really
                          what attitude you are in. There is always
                          that concern about trying to get back into
                          the attitude you must be in. Particularly,
                          when you are coming around at the end of the
                          third orbit to buy off on a go or no-go.
00 05 04 20  P     When I get much more I look at the earth. Rates
                          at this time, having powered down at approximately
                          4 hours and 35 minutes are almost exactly 0.
                          There is a very, very slight pitch rate.
                          Approximately maybe ½ degree per second.
00 05 05 16  P     . . . stowing the camera again . . . to get out
                          until after . . ..

00 05 06 28  P     Okay, should be coming up on Africa pretty
                           soon. Tip her over and see how she looks
                           without light.
00 05 06 43  P     . . . sunlight in my eyes now. Get a tan on
                           this flight at last.
00 05 07 39  P     Hello Ascension, hello Ascension, this is
                           Sigma Seven. Over.
00 05 07 52  P     Hello Ascension, hello Ascension, this is
                           Sigma Seven. Over.
00 05 08 10  P     Hello Ascension, hello Ascension, this is
                           Sigma Seven. Over.
00 05 08 38  CC    Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, Ascension Cap Com on
                           HF, do you read?
00 05 08 46 P      This is Sigma Seven. I read a station, very
                           garbled, please identify.
00 05 09 46 P      At this point in time, which is of course just
                           prior to sunset, we are coming up with a
                           batch of the white particles. They show
                           up in the blue sky. I have the horizon
                           almost in sight. And they are drifting
                           away from me.
00 05 10 08 P      Let's check and see if we actually do get yaw
                           out of these. They are tending to go up in
                           relation to me, rather than tending to draw
                           away aft. With this kind of lighting I
                           can really see the illusion of visibility,
                           due to the external problem of having smoke
                           on the outer panel. Definitely is not on
                           inner panels. It is quite easy to see by
                           changing panels through reflections that
                           it's the outer panel.
00 05 11 05 P      We are now going into night coming up on 5 hours
                           11 minutes. Suit dome is setting at 7.0 very
                           happily. Suit itself is at 62 (degrees) and
                           I am happy.
00 05 11 28 P      Testing, 1 2.

00 05 11 36  P     I have some pretty stars in sight, and also I
                           have the little white objects that seem to
                           come from the capsule itself and drift off.
                           If they are a yaw check it's fantastic. I
                           suspect that the star I see is Arcturus. It
                           would be very interesting - it is neither.
                           It is one of the white objects . . . two
                           stars are staying quite still. The white
                           object actually looked like it came toward
                           me, but it wasn't. I can actually see the
                           particle now, flying off as John described it,
                           as a lathe shaving. It's a very good description
                           of it.
00 05 12 39  P     My rates are now just about 0 in all three axes.
                           I still have light in the periscope, of course.
                           I am looking straight up and yet at this point
                           which is . . . , that my attitude is - let me get
                           into the couch here. I really can't pick it
                           too well, I am just about inverted at this
                           point, and that my nose is above the horizon.
                           As a result I notice that these particles
                           keep tending aft of me, relative to me at
                           any time.
00 05 13 48  P     Periscope is blacking out rather rapidly at
                           sunset.
00 05 13 57  P     It is almost blacked out completely at this
                           point. It is really not usable.
00 05 14 45  P     Getting a real burst of light in the window. I
                           really don't know what it is. At this point
                           I should be coming up on the sunset. Five
                           hours 15 minutes. Periscope is dark. I must
                           be just getting a last look at the horizon;
                           yet I'm not down on it. Here we go into night
                           rather rapidly. Now we're into the night side.
                           I am apparently pointed towards the surface of
                           the earth, as I can see clouds with lightning
                           in them.

	INDIAN OCEAN SHIP

00 05 15 53  P     Indian Ocean Ship, this is Sigma Seven. How do
                           you read? Over.

	IOS-4

00 05 15 58 CC    . . . with a little bit of background noise.
                             Over.
00 05 16 05 P     Roger, I have to run my volume up to read you.
                             I am talking UHF-hi at this time. I am
                             drifting, and I suppose dreaming. I understand
                             you saw me last time, over.
00 05 16 20 CC    That is Roger. We had a 5 minute visual sighting
                             for about 9 degrees or over.
00 05 16 28 P     Very good. Looks like you've got some lightning
                             down your way now.
00 05 16 33 CC    Do you have an intermediate report for me at
                             this time?
00 05 16 36 P     That's affirmative. Are you ready to copy -
                             all systems were green at the time. At 5
                             hours fuel was 89 (percent) auto, 90 manual.
                             Oxygen 56 (psi, in hundreds) primary, 75
                             secondary. Were you copying?
00 05 17 07 CC    Roger, I have your load and oxygen only at this
                             time.
00 05 17 12 P     Roger. The fuel quantity, did you get that?
00 05 17 15 CC    Negative.
00 05 17 16 P     Okay, 89 (percent) automatic, 90 manual.
00 05 17 24 CC    Roger. Your gyros and maneuver switch?
00 05 17 27 P     Okay, gyros are caged, maneuver switch is off.
                             I am powered down.
00 05 17 35 CC    Roger. We have request from the Cape for a blood
                             pressure reading since they did not get one
                             at pass over at MCC. Over.
00 05 17 41 P     Okay, you deserve one anyway. Coming up. In
                             addition, I would like to give you the suit
                             inlet temperature, which was 62 degrees.


	Page 124
	IOS-4

00 05 17 54 CC    Roger.
00 05 17 55 P     The suit dome (temperature) is 70 degrees and
                         the circuit is comfortable.
00 05 18 03 CC    Wonderful. We also have a request from the Cape.
                         On your next pass over California, between
                         6 08 and 6 10, they are going to pass your
                         voice to live TV. Over.
00 05 18 19 P     Roger, understand at 6 08 to 6 10.
00 05 18 23 CC    They would like you to say something to the live
                         TV audience at that time. Over.
00 05 18 27 P     Roger.
00 05 18 39 P     At this time I will perform an orientation test.
                         Missed the manual fuel (handle) by 2 inches,
                         and capsule repressurization (handle).
00 05 18 58 P     Try to touch the yaw attitude (indicator) touched
                         the yaw attitude (indicator) at 270 degree
                         indication. Try to touch the manual emergency
                         rate lever. And I will - I put my hand right
                         on it. I believe I am through on this test
                         over the other (yawning) - I'm yawning - by
                         considerable margin.
00 05 19 39 CC    Sigma Seven, this is IOS Cap Com.
00 05 19 41 P     Go ahead.
00 05 19 42 CC    Readouts at this time?
00 05 19 44 P     Say again.
00 05 19 45 CC    Anything you want from the ground readouts at this time?
00 05 19 49 P     Negative, looks like everything's clean. I guess
                         there's not much sense in giving me scanners
                         because I'm pretty well cruising along here.
00 05 20 00 CC    Roger, do you have your time on your intermediate
                         report.

	IOS-4

00 05 20 05 P     That was at 5 hours 00 minutes 00 seconds.
00 05 20 09 CC    Good.
00 05 21 39 P     I can see my attitude now. I am - looks like
                            it's pretty good attitude. It's pitched down
                            about 55 or 60 degrees.
00 05 21 54 P     No, that's all wrong. I can now see that I must
                            have been inverted. The horizon is coming
                            into view, and some stars.
00 05 22 59 CC    Sigma Seven, IOS Cap Com, 1 minute to LOS.
00 05 23 02 P     Roger, IOS, thank you for your cooperation and
                            enjoyed talking with you.
00 05 23 28 P     IOS, I'm going to try HF again after I leave you
                            just to see how we do.
00 05 24 16 P     Indian Ocean Ship, this is Sigma Seven on HF. How
                            do you read? Over.
00 05 24 47 P     IOS, this is Sigma Seven on HF. How do you read?
                            Over.
00 05 25 04 P     This flight I think I can take a whack at this
                            photometer at last.
00 05 25 25 P     Turn off the cabin lights first. - It's off -
                            Extincted - total loss.
00 05 26 33 P     Getting - getting a good look at Orion at this
                            time. Beautiful view of it. There are the
                            Pleiades, Alvagrin. I'll look at Alvagrin
                            and see what I can do with that.
00 05 27 18 P     I have extincted Alvagrin to read at 05 27 27.
                            Now this experiment isn't going to be valuable;
                            I need cabin lights to see. It's awfully hard
                            to find the extinction photometer. Let's see

00 05 28 08  P     I'm unable to run any more tests on stars at
                          time. I am coming back to the view of
                          the surface of the earth. There's quite a
                          bit of moonlight, and as a result the horizon
                          is very bright.
00 05 28 29  P     I'll put the photometer in an area where it may
                          be available again. At 05 28 48, the rates are
                          almost exactly-negative-yaw is 0; pitch is
                          -½; and roll is roll left ½. We definitely
                          have a cold stick.
00 05 30 59  P     This quiet time must be getting to a lot of people
                          on the ground. I think we should probably put
                          some more data in here. Gathered at 5 hours
                          and 31 minutes. And about this time they want
                          an intermediate report. We'll get it for them.
00 05 32 57  P     Okay, we'll take an electrical check. Main bus
                          is 24 (volts) - Isolated bus is - clicking
                          because of the clock, of course-and that's
                          27 to 27-½ (volts).

00 05 33 27  P     Hello Muchea Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. I read
                          you. How me, over?
00 05 33 36  CC    Sigma Seven, this is Muchea Cap Com. I think I
                          read . . . say again.
00 05 33 44  P     Roger, this is Sigma Seven. I read you loud and
                          clear, Gene. There is no change in my status.
                          Over.
00 05 33 56  CC    Sigma Seven, this is Muchea, I did not read you
                          very well, but would request blood pressure.
                          Doctor Berry would appreciate blood pressure
                          during last three orbits.
00 05 34 13  P     Roger, Gene. I say there is no change in my
                          status since the last report at 0500. Over.
00 05 34 26  CC    Roger, understand no change in status since
                          your last report.

00 05 34 32 P     That is correct; all quantities are the same.
00 05 34 36 CC    All quantities are the same.
00 05 34 38 P     Roger. And temperatures. Gene, I do have one
                            change. The 250 inverter is now 120 (degrees).
00 05 34 59 CC    Roger. check, 250 inverter is now 120 (degrees).
00 05 35 05 P     Very good.
00 05 35 11 CC    Roger. We do not have telemetry, so, if you
                            pressed your blood pressure button it isn't
                            doing us any good. If we get telemetry, we'll
                            give you another call.
00 05 35 21 P     I was wondering how the heck you were gonna get
                            it. It will go onboard (tape recorder) though.
                            All d-c power is 25 volts or greater. Over.

00 05 35 48 CC    Did you say d-c volts are 25?
00 05 35 52 P     That is affirmative. All of them - they are all in
                            good shape.

00 05 42 20  P     Hello PCS, PCS. This is Sigma Seven. How do
                          you read? Over.
00 05 42 30  CC    Sigma Seven, PCS. We read you weak but readable.
                          How me?
00 05 42 33  P     I read you loud and clear, Al. And nice to talk
                          to you today.
00 05 42 40  P     . . ..
00 05 42 44  P     I am talking on HF at this time.
00 05 42 52  CC    Standby, Seven.
00 05 42 53  P     Roger.
00 05 43 10  CC    Seven, this is Cap Com. Anything you want to say.
00 05 43 13  P     Nothing in particular. Wanna say hello to you
                          though. All the systems are perfect. There
                          are no changes in quantities since the 05 00
                          summary. Over.
00 05 43 30  CC    Roger. We have one message for you. They would
                          like to attempt to contact you over Hawaii
                          through the relay airplanes. So, would you
                          please go up to UHF prior to acquisition of
                          Hawaii? Over.
00 05 43 46  P     I understand, Al, Roger.
00 05 43 53  CC    We do not have T/M as yet. We might pick it up
                          in a couple of minutes.
00 05 43 57  P     Right, I'm - very far south of you as you know.
                          How's the weather there?
00 05 44 04  CC    You sound a little scratchy to me, Wally.
00 05 44 06  P     Roger, we're still pretty far apart. How is your
                          weather there?


	Page 129
	PCS-4

00 05 44 13 CC    Say again.
00 05 44 14 P     How is the weather there?
00 05 44 18 CC    Weather actually is fairly good here in location.
                            I think on your next pass you might be able to
                            see the typhoon. I'll give you a bearing and
                            distance when you come over next time.
00 05 44 27 P     Very good, we had quite a flap on this suit circuit
                            for the first orbit as you may know.
00 05 44 40 CC    Sorry, Seven, not reading you very well.
00 05 44 42 P     Roger, I said we had a lot of trouble with the
                            suit circuit in the beginning of the flight.
00 05 44 53 CC    Sigma Seven, you're breaking up too much.
00 05 44 55 P     Roger. I'll be back.
00 05 45 00 CC    Why don't you - why don't you take a rest for
                            awhile, you've bean talking quite a bit.
00 05 45 06 P     Good show.
00 05 46 00 CC    . . . Hawaii.
00 05 46 10 P     That is correct Al, and we'll talk better next
                            time around.
00 05 46 16 CC    Roger. See you next time.
00 05 46 18 P     Roger, it's real nice up here today.
00 05 47 33 P     At this point I'm in VOX record. I'm going to
                            switch to UHF for relay aircraft in Hawaii area.
                            The time is 05 hours 47 minutes 44 seconds.
00 05 47 49 CC    . . . I'll give you a mark on GET of 05 48 00 -
                            3,2,1. MARK. GET 05 48 00.
00 05 48 08 P     Roger, I had that 03 seconds. I am 3 seconds
                            fast on you Al.

00 05 48 22 P     I am going to switch to UHF at this time. You
                          are really crystal clear here.

00 05 55 56   P      This is Sigma Seven, giving the effects of flying
                       inverted in a sunrise, 90 degrees yaw. It is the
                       most obvious thing to you, what your direction
                       of path is. Like looking out of a railroad train
                       window. You see the terrain going by you. There
                       are clouds of all varied types. I can see them
                       sweeping by me just by the 90 degree plane-in the -
                       90 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.
                       Very, very graphic display of yaw. As I swing
                       around now, my blunt end is starting to go into
                       proper yaw attitude although I am inverted. I
                       see a small island at this point. And it's nice
                       and bright in the cockpit again. We have light at
                       approximately 5 56 this pass. There, we're
                       almost swung around into yaw now.

00 05 58 19  P     Hi, Gus. How are you doing?
00 05 58 21  CC    Real good. How about you?
00 05 58 22  P     Oh, fine. I'm not bored up here. I just flew
                            over Midway a while ago. Got a good look at
                            that. I'm steaming up towards you-all now, of
                            course, north of you. I gave Gene Duret my
                            intermediate report - if he could pick me up on
                            HF. Actually . . ..
00 05 58 45 CC    Go ahead with your report.
00 05 58 46 P     Okay, as you know, the control mode is set up
                            for drifting. The mode selected is normal,
                            auto, gyros caged. I've selected reentry
                            attitude. I'm of course in fly-by-wire
                            low. The maneuver switch is off. I'll
                            give you the fuel quantities and oxygen.
                            Just to check yours against mine. I still
                            have 89 (percent) auto and 90 (percent) manual.
00 05 59 20 CC    Roger. Was that 89-90?
00 05 59 22 P     That's affirmative 89-90.
00 05 59 25 CC    Roger
00 05 59 26 P     Oxygen, I have 55 and 75 (psi, in hundreds).

00 05 59 46 P     Suit inlet temperature is still about 61 to
                            62 (degrees). The dome is about 72. It's
                            about as cool as I want it. It's just
                            beautiful.

00 05 59 57  CC   Roger. We confirm those quantities, Wally.
                          Looks like you're in good shape. Did you
                          get the message to go to UHF prior to elapsed
                          time of 6 18.
00 06 00 08 P     Right, I have that on my card, also Watertown got
                          it to me on HF. But neither Watertown nor you
                          could hear me. I heard you loud and clear.
00 06 00 19 CC    Were you reading me through relay?
00 06 00 20 P     That's affirmative, so I would suggest to you,
                          broadcast in the blind if you have something
                          hot for me.
00 06 00 26 CC    Roger. I'll do that anyway, and I'm glad to hear
                          that you got us at least.
00 06 00 30 P     Right, I heard you way back and, I'd say at about
                          5 hours and 53 minutes.
00 06 00 39 CC    Say that time again.
00 06 00 40 P     Five hours and 53 minutes.
00 06 00 43 CC    Repeat the whole time. I missed it.
00 06 00 45 P     Five hours 53 minutes.
00 06 00 49 CC    Roger.
00 06 01 03 P     Sure breaking tradition on this pass.
00 06 01 07 CC    Roger, how do you like drifting flight?
00 06 01 10 P     Great sport. The rates are not consistent. They
                          do change.
00 06 01 17 CC    Roger, understand. Your rates do change.
00 06 01 19 P     That's affirmative. I've never had more than
                          about, of, I would say about 3/4 of a degree
                          per second in any one direction.
00 06 01 30 CC    Wally, you're cutting in and out on voice.
                          Possibly we're losing it.

00 06 01 34 P     Okay. Can you read me better with the push-to-talk?
00 06 04 33 P     At 6 hours and 4 minutes - we have a 1 degree per
                             second right yaw rate. 0 degree per second
                             pitch, and 3/4 of a degree per second left
                             roll. No change in fuel quantity. No detectible
                             thruster action. We are swinging
                             around and acquiring the horizon at this point.

00 06 05 48 P     California Cap Com, this is Sigma Seven, over.
00 06 06 04 CC    Hello Sigma Seven, this is Cal Cap Com. How
                             do you feel, over.
00 06 06 07 P     Read you loud and clear, John. How me?
00 06 06 09 CC    You're loud and clear. Everything's solid down
                             here. I guess you got the word on the 6 08
                             bit. Is that affirm?
00 06 06 14 P     That's affirmative. You have T/M on me now?
                             I'll power up before all that jazz.
00 06 06 20 CC    Okay, Roger. T/M is solid.
00 06 06 21 P     Okay. I have gyros normal, auto, gyros caged.
                             I am going to power up and then go - correction -
                             gonna power up and fly-by-wire. Monitoring the
                             a-c bus at this time. She comes up to 115
                             (volts). I have 25 amps, in good shape.
00 06 06 45 CC    Roger. We confirm.
00 06 06 47 P     I'll hold off on my beacon. Clock's at 6 06
                             approximately I guess, when I powered up, so
                             that it would be good at about 6 11. I have
                             no change in consumables, John. It looks real
                             good here.
00 06 07 06 CC    Roger. Everything's looking fine here. We have
                             T/M solid and we confirm your actions here.

00 06 07 11 P     Roger. I got a real weird attitude at this
                           point I'll clue you. Ha, ha, I'm looking
                           down at the earth. I'm sort of coming toward
                           you head first, inverted.
00 06 07 23 CC    Roger. You can pick your own up from that
                           standpoint.
00 06 07 26 P     Yeah. You really get the illusion you're
                           ready for a split S every once in a while,
                           don't you?
00 06 07 33 CC    Right.
00 06 07 40 CC    Wally, I'll give you a count to the 6 08 here
                           so we . . . start in. They're going to have it
                           on for 2 minutes beginning at 6 08. That's
                           about 20 seconds, here.
00 06 07 46 P     Okay, John, sounds like fun.
00 06 08 04 CC    Okay, Sigma Seven. This is Cal Cap Com. You're
                           at 6 08. Two minutes on live TV. Go ahead,
                           Wally.
00 06 08 10 P     Roger, John. Just came out of the powered down
                           configuration where we had the ASCS inverter
                           off. It came up in good shape and will stay
                           on now for the rest of the flight. The amps
                           and volts are reading properly. The amps are
                           now down to about 19 amps, after we powered
                           up. They were up to 25 at first. I'm coming
                           toward you inverted this time, which is an
                           unusual way for any of us to approach
                           California, I'll admit.
00 06 08 44 CC    Roger, Wally, you got anything to say to everyone,
                           watching you across country on this thing. We're
                           going out live on this.
00 06 08 50 P     That sounds like great sport, I can see why you
                           and Scott like it. I'm having a trick now. I'm
                           looking at the United States and starting to pitch
                           up slightly with this drifting rate. And I see
                           the moon, which I'm sure no one in the United
                           States can see as well as I right now.

00 06 09 08 CC    I think you're probably right.
00 06 09 09 P     Ha, ha. I suppose an old song "Drifting and
                             Dreaming" would be apropos at this point, but
                             at this point I don't have a chance to dream.
                             I'm enjoying it too much.
00 06 09 22 CC    Things are looking real good from here, Wally.
00 06 09 24 P     Thank you, John. I guess that what I'm doing
                             right now is sort of a couple of Immelmans
                             across the United States.
00 06 09 37 CC    Roger. Wally, have you had a chance to observe
                             a haze layer any?
00 06 09 42 P     Yes, I have. It's quite fascinating; in fact,
                             it's misleading in the evening. Gives you the
                             feeling that you are pitched down quite far.
                             Have you noticed that?
00 06 09 54 CC    Roger.
00 06 09 55 P     It's projected up much higher in the evening.
00 06 10 06 P     Ah, I see you got me on a Z Cal.
00 06 10 12 CC    Negative, did not send Z Cal, Over.
00 06 10 14 P     Oh, somebody did. Maybe Scotty.
00 06 10 18 CC    May have.

	GUAYMAS

00 06 10 19 CC    Roger . . . Z Cal off now.
00 06 10 22 P     See, you can't be sneaky with me, can you Scott?
                             Now I got the P O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen partial pressure),
                             which goes to 0 when you do that. Okay, R Cal.
                             How's that? Anybody want blood pressure.
00 06 10 34 CC    Say again, Wally.


	Page 138
	GYM-4

00 06 10 36  P     Okay, I'll send you blood pressure now.
00 06 10 40  CC    Roger, standing by. Cal coming off.
00 06 10 44  P     Blood pressure on.
00 06 10 54  CC    We have your blood pressure. Standing by for a
                           standard report.
00 06 10 58  P     Roger, Scott. I am in drifting flight, but I have
                           powered up the ASCS a-c bus. It has come on the
                           line very well. I will power up the beacons
                           later. The control mode selected is fly-by-wire
                           although I'm not controlling in it. The auto
                           switch is auto, gyros switch is still caged.
                           The reentry attitude is selected, maneuver is
                           off. The quantities are all in the green.
                           Suit temperature is about 60 (degrees). I'm
                           quite comfortable with it. Electrical is green
                           and a-c is green.
00 06 11 47  CC    Roger, and could we have one more blood pressure,
                           please. I didn't get the last. Your (recovery
                           area) 5-1 TORF (time of retrofire) I have. Are
                           you ready to copy?
00 06 12 00  P     Let me get that first, then I'll give you the blood
                           pressure.
00 06 12 03  CC    Roger, 07 18 10.
00 06 12 06  P     07 18 10.
00 06 12 10  CC    That's Roger. At 07 18 10, and for your information,
                           Ascension copied you on your last pass and they
                           are standing by to copy you again this time.
00 06 12 21  P     Roger, I'll send you a BPMS.
00 06 12 23  CC    Roger.
00 06 12 27  P     I have your 07 18 10.
00 06 12 31  CC    That is Roger, 07 18 10 for (recovery area) 5-1.
00 06 12 35  P     Roger.

00 06 13 03  CC    Incidentally, Wally, if we have LOS before we
                              read the last of your blood pressure, don't
                              forget to turn her off.
00 06 13 12  P     Roger. Thank you.
00 06 13 22  P     Going to VOX record only momentarily.
00 06 13 26  P     Now in the dosimeter check, it is still reading
                              less than 1/10 on the lowest scale.
00 06 14 40  P     (Picture) Able 8 taken at 06 14 40. A coastline.
                              It should have been the coast of . . . Tampico,
                              just south of Texas.
00 06 15 23  P     All color shots have been made so far, no black
                              and white I'm going to try to take another
                              shot here of a cloud structure, at 06 15 30.
00 06 15 37  P     Go ahead. Go ahead. Cape Cap Com.

00 06 15 47  P    This is Sigma Seven. Go ahead, Deke.
00 06 15 50  CC   Roger, you're coming in weak and intermittent.
                    Can you read us? Over.
00 06 15 54  P    Roger. I'm coming up at this time at - just
                    across the Yucatan Peninsula here.
00 06 16 05  CC   Sigma Seven. Standby, we're still not reading
                    you.
00 06 16 07  P    Roger.
00 06 16 25  CC   Sigma Seven. Cap Com. Let's try it again.
00 06 16 27  P    Deke, this is Sigma Seven. Just passing over
                    the Yucatan peninsula.
00 06 16 35  CC   Roger. You're still weak and intermittent.
00 06 16 38  P    Roger.
00 06 17 04  CC   Sigma Seven. Cap Com. How do you read
                    now?
00 06 17 06  P    I read you loud and clear. How me?
00 06 17 09  CC   Roger, you are loud and clear. You were
                    very garbled before.
00 06 17 11  P    Roger. I'm doing partial control on fly-by-wire
                    low. Will acquire ASCS when I get in
                    retroattitude. No problem, just the bird's
                    flying beautifully, and give her a break.
00 06 17 27  CC   Roger.
00 06 17 30  P    When you have a yaw of 90 degrees, it's just
                    like looking at a train window - that's
                    all there is to it. That's about what I'm
                    going through now. Just walking right around
                    the horizon, Deke.

00 06 17 51 P     Say again, Deke.
00 06 17 52 CC    Give us a cabin pressure.
00 06 17 54 P     Roger. Standby. Okay. It's about - just
                           about 5 (psi) on the button.
00 06 18 01 CC    Roger.
00 06 18 02 P     Okay.
00 06 18 06 CC    Have you eaten yet? We haven't been able to
                           confirm this.
00 06 18 08 P     That's affirmative. I had some peaches and
                           a couple of cubes. I didn't want to eat
                           it all up in one batch.
00 06 18 15 CC    That's a good idea.
00 06 18 18 P     Spread it out a little bit, you know.
00 06 18 20 CC    How are you feeling in general?
00 06 18 23 P     Very fine, Deke. It's the first time I've
                           had a chance to relax since last December.
                           I've been exercising a little bit to get my
                           muscles toned up as well. Not exactly
                           walking around but a little bit of stretching.
00 06 18 42 CC    . . . (You say - you say you are what?)<sup>G</sup>
00 06 18 46 P     Roger.
00 06 18 50 CC    Did you say you'd like to get up and walk
                           around?
00 06 18 52 P     I did a little exercise.
00 06 18 54 CC    Roger. Understand.

                           How do you read me? Over.
00 06 24 15 P     This is Sigma Seven on VOX record only. I have
                           reestablished auto mode in normal with no high
                           thruster action. At this point I have 85
                           percent auto, 90 percent manual. And I
                           feel, now that I am on ASCS, I can do some

	CNV-5

                           experiments where before I was not able to.
                           I will now pitch the capsule down on fly-by-wire
                           low. First I will check to see -
                           if I turn on my beacons, nobody down here
                           can get to me on those. At 6 hours and
                           25 minutes - if anybody has a beacon in
                           South America they deserve to hear it.
                           Beacons are on, for a good 3 amps. Opening
                           visor to wipe off chin, and I think I'll
                           take a drink of water.
00 06 26 22 P     Closing visor. Okay. Let's take a look and
                           see where we are. At this point we made
                           a dosimeter check. I will pitch down on
                           fly-by-wire to reentry attitude. Now let's
                           give it a manual proportional go this time.
00 06 27 37 P     In manual proportional, with manual lever
                           pulled out, and having selected rate command.
                           I'm slowly but surely coming into retroattitude.
                           All axes are working very well.
                           Setting up in roll. Getting yaw rates, pow,
                           pow. And I want this to count - I'm going
                           to go back to fly-by-wire low.
00 06 27 37 P     That was stupid. Now we go to fly-by-wire
                           low. I had a case of double authority and
                           really flotched it. But better conserve
                           our fuel. It's much too easy to get into
                           double authority, even with the tremendous
                           logic you have working on all these systems.
                           The pitch is in; yaw is in; selecting
                           reentry attitude; roll is in; going to ASCS,
                           reentry now. And she's in.
00 06 29 58 P     Okay. I think we can change backs, and get
                           some weather bureau pictures if it's
                           possible. Shoot up the rest - the rest of
                           these, just lightly. That's A 10 at 6+30
                           hours, and 11 is coming up, and 6+30 hours
                           with a cloud bank off to the left. Okay.
                           I'll get the plate back on, and save this
                           at A. Take the plate back out again, zap.
                           Okay. That's wound up, A 12 to go.

00 06 31 23 P     The capsule at this point is, at 6 hours and
                           31 minutes, it is under chimp configuration.
                           I've used manual proportional to a great
                           degree. I now have 79 (percent) in manual
                           (fuel) and 81 (percent) auto. Let's see
                           how we stand. Ah, 81, 80 auto, 71 manual.
00 06 32 25 P     I fouled up, oh shucks.
00 06 33 07 P     That's clever. - Weather bureau back is finally
                           out. First shot not worth using, so I'll
                           change that. - Okay. We got slider out.
                           Weather filter in, if I can get it. This
                           side toward lens. There, we got a filter in.
                           I'm going to shoot at ASA 64.
00 06 34 42 P     Take a light value at 06 35 minutes, and that
                           light value is 13 for 64 ASA. Very good.
                           Fairly bright, . . . I'll give her 13, and
                           we'll punch off a couple quickies because
                           of the first bad one. First shot taken at
                           6 35 25.
00 06 35 47 P     Second shot 6 35 45.
00 06 36 37 P     Capsule is in perfect attitude. Ideal shots
                           for weather bureau. Think I even put on
                           finder at this time. Shooting black and
                           white of the clouds.
00 06 37 01 P     In the white. Ready to shoot at 6 -06 37 07.
                           That was an oblique. Shot number 3. I'll
                           take shot number 4 almost as straight down
                           as I can sight. Beyond a little bit of
                           shadow as we approach sunset. Okay, that
                           was 6 37 34.
00 06 37 01 P     That's capsule elapsed time. At 6 38 we will
                           copy the manual intermediate report and I
                           can do that at this time.
00 06 38 48 P     Okay, at 6 hours and 35 minutes we are at 81
                            (percent auto fuel) - 79 (percent manual fuel).
                            . . .cabin 90 (degrees). . . suit 63 (degrees)
                            . . .. Dome 71 (degrees).

00 06 40 25 P     We're now at 6 40. Going to map two.
00 06 41 43 P     At this point, I made a complete electrical
                           check. All electrical systems are green.
                           The amps are about 19 amps. This is very
                           logical after we've been inserted. The
                           load has been diving over release of relays
                           at T<sub>r</sub>+5.
00 06 42 04 P     All the equipment is in good order. Coming
                           up over IOS for 6+50, in the night, and
                           this time I want to go down the star charts
                           to check this bear out. That is why I
                           am on ASCS.
00 06 42 27 P     Had the fun with experimenting and now will
                           get the fun of being ready for reentry at
                           any time. Okay. Let's see - we got IOS
                           at 6 40. 6 40. . . . same as 0 52.
00 06 44 03 P     There is a nice interesting horizon. The
                           sun is off to the left about - oh I'd say
                           40 degrees. There's a dark line of the
                           surface of the earth, orange at the clouds -
                           a light yellow, a light white and a blue
                           band. A very light blue and I have the
                           Planet Mercury in sight at this point.
                           Before the sun has set. And it's in the
                           proper position.
00 06 44 37 P     Describing the blue band. There's a
                           relatively dark blue band right at the
                           surface of the earth, and a light blue
                           band, and another dark blue band, and a
                           large white band which is the air glow,
                           and then a deep black one and sorta goes
                           from a grayish blue in to a dense black.
                           Almost looks like underneath a rain cloud
                           as far as the transition from the blue
                           band to the total darkness.

                           And I'll bring up my fingertip lights. And
                           at 06 45 52 Mercury is right on the horizon.
                           Arcturus should be in view, but I guess we
                           we can't get her.
00 06 45 45 P     Okay, I<sup>T</sup> see Mercury going through
                           the - air glow. We'll see if she holds up.
                           When I said, "I see" that was the beginning
                           of it. MARK,<sup>T</sup> the first change
                           of color, which is now a light blue. And
                           it's still visible. MARK,<sup>T</sup> a
                           darker blue. Visible MARK,<sup>T</sup> into
                           the yellow orange of the surface of the
                           earth. This was - Mercury, dropping over
                           the horizon. I should be picking up the
                           moon and Venus fairly soon. At 6 46 -
                           and at 6 48 I'm over IOS.
00 06 49 12 P     Okay, it looks like we are getting some lighted
                           areas over the southern tip of Africa. I
                           definitely have a city in sight, and - this
                           is Sigma Seven. On transmit, I've had on
                           VOX record only. I definitely have a city
                           in sight in Africa. It first showed up at
                           06 49 30 seconds. The lights come up very
                           clear. I'm in retroattitude at this point
                           to give a mark on my position, and the moon
                           is on my flight path for yaw references
00 06 50 07 P     I'll bet you any money that city my left,
                           and was Port Elizabeth.

00 06 51 39 P     Roger. I read you weak.
00 06 51 43 CC    Do you have a short report for me? Over.
00 06 51 45 P     Roger. I'll give you my configuration. I
                           am in auto, retro control mode; gyros are
                           normal; maneuver switch is off; all consumables
                           are in the green; electrical is
                           checking out very well; capsule is tracking
                           well. The moon is perfect reference
                           at this point, it is right on the predicted
                           path as well as Venus, as you probably
                           know from down there.
00 06 52 18 CC    Roger. We have a CET. You have about a
                           plus 3 second lead on your CET.
00 06 52 27 P     Would you give me a countdown on CET, please.
00 06 52 30 CC    Roger. On my mark it will be 06 52 33.
                           MARK<sup>T</sup>
00 06 52 38 P     That was 33 - that's about a 4 second difference.
                           I see you have some good ole'
                           lightning again.
00 06 52 51 CC    Sigma Seven. Not to mention the word, but
                           will you send a BP? (blood pressure) Over.
00 06 52 56 P     Okay.
00 06 53 35 CC    This is IOS Cap Com. Standing by.
00 06 53 38 P     Roger. If you'll stand by I'm going to take
                           a check on Venus, at this point, for extinction
                           to see how she looks.
00 06 53 45 CC    Roger.
00 06 54 26 P     Okay. Venus is extincted at 06 54 29, at a
                          value of 5.2.
00 06 54 40 CC    Seven. What was the time you stated?
00 06 54 44 P     I'm just recording data.

00 06 54 44 P     The standard light is also extincted at 3.8.
00 06 56 04 P     Picture taken, 06 56 27 black and white, of
                            the moon. With the weather bureau filter
                            pulled out. Picture number 6. And as the
                            moon sets we'll try one more at a lower
                            shutter speed. Trying to hold it carefully.
                            That's the second picture taken of the
                            moon at moon set. At this point the camera
                            back will be reinstalled and the camera
                            stowed in case of retro attempt.
00 06 57 12 P     Hello! - A pretty flash of light.
00 06 57 52 P     Camera is going to be stowed in the space
                            dome.
00 07 00 12 P     . . ..
00 07 00 24 P     Auto beacons. Beacons are on power now.
                            Camera is stowed.
00 07 03 31 P     Okay while I'm reading instruments, the 250
                            is 145 (degrees). That is the 250 inverter.
                            The 150 inverter is 105 (degrees), and the
                            standby inverter is 119 (degrees), retro
                            temperature is 75 (degrees). Yaw right
                            100 (degrees), yaw left 90 (degrees),
                            pitch down 96 (degrees), pitch up 102
                            (degrees), cabin heat exchanger 42 (degrees),
                            roll left manual 98 (degrees), roll right
                            auto 108 (degrees), roll left auto 108
                            (degrees), samey, samey. Very good. And
                            this report was made at 07 04 40.
00 07 06 07 P     All systems look very good at this point.
                            This is as tight a vehicle as anyone can
                            imagine.
00 07 10 29 P     At 07 hours 10 minutes and 30 seconds, I see
                            a lighted area. Very well lighted. - It
                            shows up more like an airport. Better
                            identify where that would be - that should
                            be the Phillippines. Possibly it's at
                            Zamboanga, and that's 07 hours 10 minutes


	Page 151
	IOS-PCS-5

                          and 30 seconds. Very graphic series of
                          lights. Very easy to see.
00 07 11 38 P     Correction, at 07 hours and minutes put me
                          over.
00 07 11 48 P     . . .. It's marked on the chart at 07
                          hours and 10 minutes. I was looking
                          down at - almost in retroattitude. It
                          showed up very clearly.
00 07 12 25 P     Now we're getting a planet in sight. Roger.
                          Jupiter. I can see a string of stars for
                          Grus, and good ole' Formalhaut - there in
                          the upper corner, Grus coming down through
                          the middle. And Formalhaut coming right
                          down middle. Very good.
00 07 13 24 P     All attitudes seem to be checking out very well.
                          Head and couch with scribe line works. My
                          reticle at this, quick check on it.
00 07 13 47 P     Unable to dim reticle sufficiently for a night
                          acquisition. MARK again Grus that is, of
                          the stars themselves in the window. . . ..
                          Thaurus is coming right down through the
                          center line. Could yaw right about 5
                          degrees which would satisfy dead reckoning.
                          Then roll left about 5 (degrees) which is
                          quite graphic. For retro, this looks like
                          a very good set-up. Be no problem at all
                          flying attitude here with the moon bright
                          . . . light which would be dawn's light.
                          Occasionally you can see a ground light,
                          particularly, along the island chain at
                          this point.

00 07 16 02 CT    Roger. Sigma Seven. Reading you 5 by, 5 by.
                           Going to Cap Com.
00 07 16 06 P     Roger.
00 07 16 10 CC    Hello Seven. Standing by for your report.
00 07 16 11 P     Roger, Al. I am in auto; retro; the gyro
                           switches are normal; maneuver is off. The
                           capsule is prepared for retrosequence but
                           for stowing two charts. I'm sure we're go.
                           I have 81 percent auto, (fuel) 80 percent
                           manual (fuel), which is the same as my
                           intermediate report. They did not change.
                           I have 52 (psi, in hundreds) on primary,
                           75 (psi, in hundreds) on secondary oxygen.
                           Suit is go at 62 (degrees). Same as before.
00 07 16 53 CC    Roger, Seven. I did not catch your manual
                           fuel reading. You broke up a little bit.
                           Will you give that to me please?
00 07 16 58 P     Roger. Manual is 80 (percent).
00 07 17 04 CC    Roger. I have 81 (percent) auto, 80 (percent)
                           manual, oxygen 5,200 (psi) and 7,500 (psi).
00 07 17 12 P     That is correct.
00 07 17 13 CC    Well, I would say you were definitely go. We
                           are out of contact with the Cape at the
                           moment, but looks like you are good for the
                           full route.
00 07 17 20 P     Right you are. Now my CET, I guess, is about
                           3 seconds fast, as you know.
00 07 17 29 CC    Roger. Why don't you give me a time hack on it?
00 07 17 31 P     Okay. I'll give you a 35. MARK 35.<sup>T</sup>
00 07 17 37 CC    Roger. You are about 3 seconds fast. I show your
                           TORF (time of retrofire) as 08 Volume 1 21.
00 07 17 44 P     Roger. That is what I have in.


	Page 153
	PCS-5

00 07 17 47 CC    Your T/M on CET is also 2 seconds fast. The
                           retrosequence for (contingency recovery area)
                           5-Echo is nominal.
00 07 17 56 P     Roger. 5 Echo, Al. It's a real ball.
00 07 18 01 CC    Man - sound like you're really enjoying it.
                           I'll give you a few seconds of silence
                           while I send through a calibration.
00 07 18 07 P     Okay.
00 07 18 50 CC    Seven this is Cap Com.
00 07 18 52 P     Roger. I see you are still on R Cal.
00 07 18 54 CC    Affirmed. The R Cal is now off.
00 07 18 58 P     Roger. I have it coming off.
00 07 19 00 CC    We've been comparing the free surface effect
                           of liquid on the center of gravity of the
                           capsule, and we recommend that you drain
                           the bilges prior to reentry.
00 07 19 10 P     Ha! Ha! Ha!
00 07 19 11 CC    It's during the coming orbit.
00 07 19 13 P     I'm concur.
00 07 19 16 CC    Also, Seven. At LOS, which should occur about
                           07 21, the typhoon will be located about
                           400 miles about 45 degrees left of your track.
                           So you should be able to pick it up.
00 07 19 31 P     Oh, very good. I'll look for it.
00 07 19 34 CC    And we are reading you loud and clear and will
                           be standing by for your HF check at 7 20.
00 07 19 40 P     Roger.
00 07 19 42 CC    If you have nothing further, I'll see you
                           next time.

00 07 19 45 P     Okay. I'll drop in.
00 07 19 49 CC    Standing by.
00 07 19 50 P     Roger, Al. Thanks a lot.
00 07 20 06 P     Gyros are free.
00 07 20 16 CC    Seven. PCS.
00 07 20 22 P     This is Sigma Seven. On HF. This is Sigma
                           Seven. On HF. Giving a short count at
                           07 hours, 20 minutes, 34 seconds CET. This
                           is to check for HF coverage on the world
                           wide range. The duration of the transmission
                           is to last 60 seconds. I wish I knew what
                           else I could say to eat up the time. If I
                           breathe hard enough this might help. The
                           capsule is working very well and I believe
                           we are just about coming up on the end of
                           a 60 second mark. Using HF transmit and
                           record throughout the world wide range.
                           And this is Sigma Seven. Checking out.
00 07 21 31 CC    Seven this is PCS. Do you still read?
00 07 21 34 P     That is affirmative on HF. How do you read
                           me, Al?
00 07 21 38 CC    Loud and clear, Wally. Could you, if you have
                           time, give us a readout on how you are
                           coming on your orientation tests? Over.
00 07 21 44 P     I seem to be improving. What I am touching
                           is just these three items, but I get closer
                           to them each time I whack at it.
00 07 21 54 CC    Very good. The head shrinkers will be delighted.
00 07 21 58 P     I guess they are out of a job altogether.
00 07 22 01 CC    Okay Wally san. See you next time.
00 07 22 02 P     Righto Al. Thanks again.

00 07 33 16 P     Roger. My status is go. I could receive all
                           the stations in the Pacific, but they
                           apparently weren't receiving me. Would you
                           advise them to transmit in the blind. I
                           had very good communications with the Pacific

                           difficult to understand you. That's good

00 07 43 09 P     Roger, Scott. I understand. Excuse me. Just
                           finished my beef and vegetables. I am in
                           good shape up here. I have had good
                           communications with Al. The clock is set

00 07 43 39 P     Roger. I have done that.
00 07 43 41 CC    Okay, at this time.

00 07 43 48 CC    Roger.
00 07 43 50 P     Everything looks real good, Scott.
00 07 43 52 CC    It looks real good down here Wally. Doing
                           a good job and we are looking forward to
                           seeing you shortly at Midway way.
00 07 44 00 P     Roger. We'll get some boat duty in too.
00 07 44 10 P     Scott. Do you have horizon scans on me?
00 07 44 13 CC    Roger. Wait one, Wally.
00 07 44 16 P     I would like to have you check my roll
                           attitude.
00 07 44 23 CC    Roger. CET on my mark will be 7 hours, 44
                           minutes, 30 seconds. MAKK.<sup>T</sup>
00 07 44 31 P     What? Is that right? That's what my clock
                           says.
00 07 44 36 CC    Right. That was CET. The Cape asked for
                           that. We are showing 4 seconds behind
                           you Wally.
00 07 44 43 P     Oh, okay. That was right on. Now what is
                           my roll attitude on your scanner?
00 07 44 50 CC    Okay. Your roll scanner shows minus - minus -
                           minus 10 (degrees), Wally.
00 07 45 03 P     Roger. I concur. Believe I am a little bit
                           steeper than 10 (degrees) left. I'll
                           bring that out with the manual axes and
                           then let her fly it again. And see what
                           she does.
00 07 45 20 CC    Wally. How about one more blood pressure
                           before you leave?
00 07 45 28 P     Roger. Standby.

00 07 46 09 P     Going to fly-by-wire low at this point.
                           Manual lever in. The capsule attitudes
                           appear to be very good.
00 07 46 30 CC    That's fly-by-wire low at this time. Sigma
                           Seven?
00 07 46 33 P     That's correct. I just want to check this
                           roll out during the daylight side. Pitch
                           is real honest and so is yaw. I think
                           I've got to correct about 6 degrees worth
                           of roll though.
00 07 46 50 CC    Roger. Gyros are normal? Is that correct?
00 07 46 52 P     That's correct.
00 07 47 10 CC    Wally, we also show a gyro free position on
                           the ground.
00 07 47 14 P     Roger. I just went to that free. Standby.
00 07 47 20 CC    Roger. And do you plan to return to ASCS
                           shortly?
00 07 47 25 P     Momentarily.
00 07 47 26 CC    Roger.
00 07 47 27 P     Just coming on to it.
00 07 47 30 CC    Okay. Stop the blood pressure. We got a good
                           one, Wally.
00 07 47 32 P     Okay. Stand by - normal ASCS.
00 07 47 39 CC    Roger. We're reading - gyros normal.


	Page 164
	GYM-5

00 07 47 43 P     Roger. The scanner test was what the problem
                           was. And the roll went off as we anticipated
                           it would. And I am going back to
                           gyros normal, at this time, which is about
                           2 minutes early. This is the routine that
                           was on the flight plan, if you'll see it.
00 07 48 00 CC    Roger.
00 07 48 04 P     Okay, we should pick up this roll problem that
                           I had there now that we've got the scanners
                           back on the line. Looked pretty good for
                           pitch though, it's beautiful.
00 07 48 18 CC    Roger. And the gyros are showing, at this
                           time, only a 4 degree difference, and that
                           is decreasing.
00 07 48 26 P     Roger. That's the deal. That's what I
                           wanted you to check for me while I was over
                           your station, Scott. Thank you. So it
                           looks like the ASCS is pure. I am now in -
00 07 48 37 CC    Scanners are also in agree - pitch scanners
                           in agreement with your gyros, and we have
                           T/M LOS.
00 07 48 45 P     Roger. I'm happy here.
00 07 50 12 P     This is Sigma Seven. A 30 second HF check, at
                           07 50 minutes commencing at 10 seconds after
                           that. This is a 30 second duration test,
                           as I pass down through the coast of Baja
                           California, enroute to South - South America.
                           Every system is working very properly. I
                           have 5 more seconds of check to go. Test
                           out. Sigma Seven. Switching to UHF for

00 07 52 33  P      I read you loud and clear, Murph. How do you read

00 07 52 38  CC_?   TMS calling. Repeat please. . . .. Did you receive
                            Cape Com Tech? Over.
00 07 52 44  P      Hello, Quito. This is Sigma Seven. Can you relay
                            to Cape that I read them loud and clear? Over.
00 07 52 50  CC     Yes, you are coming through fine. Any traffic you
                            have, be glad to take it. Go ahead.
00 07 52 56  P      Everything here is all set. Would you relay to
                            the Cape, I have everything under control. We
                            are all set here.
00 07 53 02  CC     Very fine. Thank you very much. You don't have any
                            word to pass on? Can you say anything in
                            Spanish to the fellows down here?

00 07 53 12  P     I'm afraid I can't. Except I would like to come
                         down and visit you. I'm enjoying a beautiful
                         sight of the country.
00 07 53 19 CC     Certainly nice to hear that, but could you say just
                         a few greetings to them? They would appreciate it
                         so much. They want to put you on their radio down
                         here.
00 07 53 27 P      I must send my greetings to the other people of
                         our same area. The fact that we are two hemispheres
                         joined is even proven today by our capability
                         of flying over each other's countries realizing
                         that we are one and the same.
00 07 53 44 CC     Would you say, "Buenas dias," or something like
                         that back to them?
00 07 53 49 P      Right, all I can do on that now is say, Buenas
                         dias you-all.
00 07 53 54 CC     Ha, ha. Thank you so much. I think they'll love
                         that.
00 07 53 57 CC_?   . . . Cape Com Tech? Over.
00 07 53 59 P      Would you relay to Cape Com Tech - Cape Com Tech
                         that I can read him?
00 07 54 03 CC     Who can you read?
00 07 54 05 P      Would you relay to Cape Canaveral Com Tech that
                         I read him.
00 07 54 10 CC     That you do read Cape Canaveral right now?
00 07 54 13 P      That's affirmative.
00 07 54 14 CC     Okay, will tell him. Thank you a lot.

00 07 55 28 CC     Were you calling Quito or Cape Com?
00 07 55 33 P      Trying to talk to the Cape. But apparently they
                            don't realize I am still talking. Quito, I can
                            hear them all loud and clear.
00 07 55 42 CC_A1  Cap Com. Did you read Cape Com Tech? Over.
00 07 56 03 CC_A1  Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven. Auto One Cap Com. If
                            you read, give a short count. Over.
00 07 56 10 P      This is Sigma Seven. We don't a transmitter
                            exercise. I do read 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1.
                            Sigma Seven. Out. I'm tired of carrying on Com.
00 07 56 33 CC_A1  Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven. Auto One Cap Com. Can
                            you read? Over.
00 07 59 06 P      At 7 hours, 59 minutes, 10 seconds, light value
                            reading, for the black and white film, is 13 for
                            ASA 64. Setting light value of 13. Taking
                            picture number 7 with filter. The continent of
                            South America is difficult to photograph because
                            of all the weather. I will take a panorama at
                            this time. Starting at 7 59 almost 8 hours. In


	Page 168
	QUITO-6

                         fact, it will be 8 hours. MARK<sup>T</sup>,
                         7, 8, 9 black photographs, black and white film.
                         Ten photographs, black and white film. The shots
                         are being taken at 250 5.6 (1/250 second and f5.6)
                         at infinity. Taking number 11, looking to the left.
                         I am coming across the South American continent
                         at this point. I have a large river in sight.
                         Take a picture, camera facing down as much as
                         possible. I believe I got the capsule window very
                         nicely there. I'll come back to - B-1 now. I've
                         shot the 12 first pictures. I'm on B-1, shooting
                         at the cloud streaks. I've shot B-2 and these are
                         all black and white shots, with weather bureau
                         filter in at 08 02. I will take the last pictures
                         of this series. That is the end of the weather
                         bureau pictures. I believe we've taken enough to
                         satisfy the requirements. Pulling out the filter.
                         Restoring the slide to the back. Removing black
                         back.
00 08 03 37  P      Bring out color back. Taking a light value reading
                         of the South American continent at 08 04 commencing,
                         - gotta change the ASA number. ASA number
                         changed to 160. Light value being measured at
                         this time. Light value is 15.
00 08 05 01  P      Very interesting terrain pictures. I will take one
                         of the horizon just for posterity. At this time,
                         that picture was A number 12, resetting to B and
                         now have B-1. Taking some colored pictures of
                         the South American continent. I don't think
                         we'll have much luck with them.
00 08 06 09  P      That was at B-2. Coming up on B-3. Pitch down at
                         this time to approximately 10 degrees. The roll
                         error that developed during the period where we
                         had the scanners off has disappeared. At this
                         point, I am going to increase the suit flow to
                         approximately- just a tad to increase the cooling
                         for reentry. See if I can bring it down a little
                         bit more. There is almost perfect attitude.


	Page 169
	QUITO-6

                        Yaw is good. Pitch is down a little steep. It's
                        definite that the yaw reticle is not good for
                        night work.
00 08 07 46 P      I'm going to stow the camera now for the check on
                        the Durban light. As we did not have any luck
                        with the flare.
00 08 08 44 P      Camera is stowed. Photometer is light enough to
                        take out and leave out. I will make another check
                        on a low-level gadget here before we terminate.
                        And it has gone up about the thickness of one line.
                        Is now reading 0.06 that is less than 0.1. All of
                        these will now be stowed in the glove box; they
                        have been on the hatch, adjacent to the hatch
                        detention spring nearest the emergency rate handle.
                        In a vertical plane parallel to the bag that holds
                        the extra goodies that can't be shoved other places.
00 08 10 52 P      At 08 hours and 10 minutes. Going to pitch up to
                        reentry attitude shortly. No reason to keep glove
                        box open at this time. Have to get the standard
                        source of light, I may be able to get it. Put
                        that away in a hurry. That'll stay there. That
                        is the yaw cover. Everything else is ready.
00 08 12 02 P      Skies are getting darker.
00 08 12 30 P      Fly-by-wire low and pitching up to reentry attitude.
                        Going to fly-by-wire low, now<sup>T</sup>.
00 08 13 19 P      Attitude okay. Pitching back down to reentry
                        attitude, correction retroattitude. No reason to
                        stay at reentry attitude. No reason to stay at
                        reentry attitude, when we can see so well in
                        retroattitude. And this is truly the attitude
                        we need to fly. Coming up on retroattitude. Roll
                        checks out. Yaw checks out. Reentry attitude is
                        on select. Stopping pitch shortly. (Pitch is
                        drifting in very slowly). Pitch is stopped - on
                        pitch. Going to ASCS auto, gyros are normal,
                        maneuver is off.

00 08 14 34  P      Closed face plate. Opened it momentarily, merely
                         to wipe my nose, and try to clear a lens, which
                         I cannot do. Reentry select. Camera is stowed.
                         I will now extinct the standard light source -
                         and cannot move the cabin light on the starboard
                         side; therefore, I will extinct it as a continual
                         reference. There, it is now extinct, at 3.3.
                         Cabin source extincted at 3.3 at 08 hours 15
                         minutes and 35 seconds CET.
00 08 16 06  P      Fly-by-wire low did check out very well.
00 08 18 02  P      Moving suit setting to 8 at this time. That is
                         the suit coolant quantity settings to 8. Suit
                         inlet is now 65 (degrees), which is comfortable.
                         In fact, I was quite cool before, but I'd like to
                         get cool again. And the dome is about 73 (degrees).
00 08 18 23  P      Cabin is all set, I don't want to lower the dome
                         any more. It's been very good. Checking on time
                         18 minutes. Okay on the clock. Thrusters - roll
                         left auto is 119 (degrees). Roll right auto is
                         115 (degrees). Roll left manual is 100 (degrees).
                         Cabin heat exchanger is 43 (degrees). Pitch up
                         auto is 95 (degrees). Pitch down auto is 95 (degrees).
                         Yaw left auto is 80 (degrees). Yaw right
                         auto 100 (degrees). 250 inverter, oh how nice,
                         less than 160 (degrees). The 150 inverter - is
                         110 (degrees). Standby is 125 (degrees). Turning
                         to cabin heat exchanger.
00 08 19 42  P      Checking out d-c volts at this time. Main bus 24
                         (volts), isolated bus 27½ (volts), one is 25 (volts).
                         Two is 25 (volts). Three is 25 (volts).
                         Standby one is 25 (volts), standby two is 25
                         (volts), isolated is 28 (volts). Back to main.
                         ASCS and fans are both 115 (volts). Drawing 20
                         amps. Oxygen remaining 50 (psi, in hundreds)

00 08 20 47  P      Will perform an orientation test at this time while
                           I'm on ASCS and not so busy. Reaching for manual
                           handle - and on it, exactly on it. Reaching for
                           yaw attitude. I hit it at 20 degrees, right
                           20 degrees. Reaching for emergency handle.
                           Right on it, negative, that one - slightly off
                           touched the side of the box first. I didn't hit
                           it exactly, I'm sure. That is completion of the
                           orientation test.
00 08 21 29  P      I have the moon in sight. There is Venus. The
                           moon is tracking beautifully. Right on in yaw,
                           right on in pitch, right on in roll. All three
                           axes are very beautiful.
00 08 22 07  P      Seems so sad just a little less than a half an
                           hour left to play with this. I am now going to
                           fly-by-wire low. Gyros free, to pitch down to
                           observe the Durban light. Gyros free, fly-by-wire
                           low, correction, I am going to manual proportional
                           at this point. I have not charged any rates so I
                           will go back to ASCS. Clean. Over to rate
                           command. Manual proportional out. I will try
                           this mode out for size. Down a very small amount,
                           23 minutes.

00 08 24 12  P      Roger, Indian Ocean Ship. Have not seen the
                         flare. I am pitching back up to retroattitude.
00 08 24 20  CC     Roger. Were you able to check the Durban lights?
00 08 24 22  P      I mean the Durban lights. I was not able to see
                         them. I see some lights on the ground - at this
                         time - in the middle of the window, which is just
                         about the time for the Durban lights. They are
                         underneath clouds and are not good enough for
                         complete recognition. Over.

00 08 24 59  CC     Could you give us a short report? Over.
00 08 25 01  P      Roger. I am back in - retroattitude. I'm going
                         back to chimpanzee configuration. The gyros are
                         normal. Everything is stowed but the photometer,
                         which will be stowed shortly.
00 08 25 22  CC     Roger.
00 08 25 26  P      I have set my suit circuit cooling valve to position
                         number 8 just to precool a little bit, and it is
                         working properly.
00 08 25 37  CC     Roger. Can we have one more blood pressure at
                         this time? Over.
00 08 25 44  P      Roger. Coming up.
00 08 25 59  CC     Sigma Seven. Did you say that your att - your mode
                         was ASCS retro?
00 08 26 05  P      I'm coming to that just now.
00 08 26 06  CC     Roger.

00 08 26 15 P      I have the moon setting at this point.
00 08 26 21 CC     Say again.
00 08 26 22 P      The moon just set. And I have lightning in
                            sight over this area.
00 08 26 25 CC     Roger. Are you about ready to go through your
                           pre-retrosequence checklist?
00 08 26 31 P      That's affirmative. Just stand by 1 second.
                           Will go to ASCS.
00 08 26 37 CC     Okay.
00 08 26 44 P      Okay, ready for pre-retrosequence checklist.
00 08 26 49 CC     Do you want some help with it?
00 08 26 50 P      Say again.
00 08 26 52 CC     Do you want some help with the checklist?
00 08 26 54 P      Negative. I am in attitude at this time. I will
                           give you the rest of the checklist for your
                           reading.
00 08 27 01 CC     Roger. Would you push to stop blood pressure,
                           please.
00 08 27 07 P      Roger. Have got that done. I've got attitude
                           select retro.
00 08 27 15 CC     Roger.
00 08 27 17 P      I've got retro correction thrusters on - normal
                           instead of low. I'm going to switch to HF
                           antenna to bicone although I'm using UHF - at
                           this time.
00 08 27 32 CC     Roger.

00 08 27 38  P      I am on bicone, and the visor is closed. All
                           other items are in their proper position. Over.
00 08 27 48  CC     Roger.
00 08 27 52  P      Checklist complete except for squib switch arm.
00 08 27 56  CC     Roger. Could you give us a cabin pressure and
                           suit readout?
00 08 28 00  P      Roger. Standby. The cabin pressure is 4.9 (psi)
                           almost 5. The suit temperature inlet is 63
                           (degrees). The cabin temperature is 92 (degrees).
00 08 28 20  CC     Sigma Seven. Say again cabin pressure. Did not
                           read you.
00 08 28 24  P      Cabin pressure is 5., 5.0 (psi).
00 08 28 29  CC     Roger.
00 08 28 35  P      I am warming up gyros although they should have a
                           bypass anyway.
00 08 29 02  CC     Sigma Seven. Everything looks good. IOS standing
                           by.
00 08 29 06  P      Roger, IOS. It looks good here.
00 08 30 45  CC     Sigma Seven. We have 1 minute to LOS.
00 08 30 48  P      Roger, I am completely secure here and ready for
                           retrofire on command.
00 08 30 49  CC     Roger.
00 08 31 11  P      All attitudes check out perfectly here. How do
                           they check with you there?
00 08 31 27  P      This is Sigma Seven. I will check fly-by-wire
                           high thrusters at this time.

00 08 34 50  P      At this time, I have completed the high
                           thruster checks. A delayed report. Each
                           axis worked beautifully. I now have 75 (percent)
                           auto (fuel) and 75 (percent) manual (fuel).
00 08 35 41  P      All attitudes are responding very nicely. Suit
                           heat dome is about 72 (degrees), suit inlet is
                           about 63 (degrees), coming down just a tad.
                           Definitely it - optimum flight setting of about
                           7½ to 8 for this vehicle. I will crack it up
                           another notch to 8. I have set the - suit
                           regulator for the coolant quantity to position 8,
                           at CET 08 36 23.
00 08 36 35  P      That's a more accurate reading on fuel if I can
                           get my fingers up to it would be 78, 78 (percent)
                           - prior to retro. I am set up to have retro
                           performed - automatic control - subsequent to
                           retro - I will switch to fly-by-wire and pitch
                           up to reentry axis - correction - subsequent to
                           retro jettison, switch to fly-by-wire, pitch up
                           reentry attitude and select rate command at 08
                           . . ..
00 08 40 35  P      Cabin, at this time, is monitoring at about 4.8
                           (psi). The suit apparently about 4 (psi), and
                           the suit pressure gage is reading 4.9 (psi). This
                           is the suit pressure gage on the suit.
00 08 41 03  P      The index finger - finger-tip light left hand
                           finally failed. They really do not have the long-time
                           durability that we're looking for.
00 08 41 19  P      The horizon is very clear. Roll and pitch look
                           very good. Yaw looks good. I believe we've got
                           a medley of stars coming into sight now to give
                           us a fix.
00 08 41 37  P      One gets the illusion that you're on a train or
                           some other vehicle, due to the humming, and you
                           feel that you should be on a track of some kind
                           and you're driving down. Much like the sound of


	Page 176
	IOS-6

                          the ship when you're under way at sea. The
                          blower noise, I assume, and the inverters give
                          you the same illusions
00 08 42 14  P     Okay. We got Grus, and we got Jupiter in the right
                          position. So our yaw reference is right on the
                          money. No problem with that. When I lean way
                          down I can pick up Jupiter, and Formalhaut should
                          come down very shortly after.
00 08 42 36  P     Have a slight roll to the right, which is indicated
                          by the gyro as well. Coming on 8 minutes and
                          50 seconds.
00 08 43 24  P     T<sub>r</sub>-10 relay must have set in, although I have no
                          clues - other than the ASCS rate gyros coming up
                          and I can't bet on those since they're in anyway
                          by the switch being selected to T<sub>r</sub>-10 bypass.
00 08 43 49  P     Gyros normal. Attitude - fly-by-wire. Retrofire
                          armed, the 3 fuses are armed. We are fat!
00 08 44 04  P     There is Jupiter,and there is Formalhaut in the
                          middle of the window, this time around. Attitude
                          is real stiff now. Just by chance, I assume.
                          Roll is right on, yaw is right on.
00 08 44 41  P     Cabin PO<sub>2</sub> at this time is about 3.9 to 4.0 (psi).
                          Cabin heat exchanger is about 50 (degrees), at this
                          time. Dome just happens to be on an upswing now.
00 08 45 01  P     Dome, cabin dome is about 57 (degrees). Cabin
                          temperature is 90 (degrees). Suit inlet is 62
                          (degrees). Oxygen remaining 50 (psi, in
                          hundreds) primary, 75 (psi, in hundreds)
                          secondary. All electrical looks good. Fuel
                          remaining, still is, 78, 78 (percent).
00 08 45 53  P     Coming up on the 5 minute to go to retrograde
                          light.
00 08 46 34  P     Five minute to go retrograde light is on.


	Page 177
	IOS-PCS-6

00 08 47 01  P      Attitude looks very good, nice and stiff. Pressure
                             is holding very well. Vehicle looks very good.
00 08 47 23  P      Roll left, not so good. Let's see what we have.
                             Five degrees roll shows up very readily.
00 08 48 21  P      Checking over the other systems. They all seem to
                             be fairly constant. Suit dome is still about
                             71 (degrees), suit inlet is 62 (degrees), which
                             this time is comfortable. Cabin pressure and suit
                             pressure and suit pressure gauge all match within
                             about 1/10 of a psi. Getting some light in the
                             periscope at this time.
00 08 48 54  P      About 2 minutes to go to retrofire. I'm in
                             UHF-hi, transmit and record, R/T. All fuse
                             switches are in the proper position but for the
                             landing switch fuses.
00 08 49 17  P      Here comes some sunlight.

	PACIFIC COMMAND SHIP

00 08 49 55  P      Pacific Command Ship this is Sigma Seven. Do
                             you read? Over.
00 08 50 04  CC     Sigma Seven this is Pacific Command Ship. Do
                             you read? Over.
00 08 50 08  CC     Affirmative, Seven. Are you reading me?
00 08 50 09  P      Roger, Al. Read you loud and clear.
00 08 50 12  CC     Understand you're ready to go home, Wally.
00 08 50 14  P      Roger. I've got everything all set, Al, except
                             for the squib switch, which I'll put on your
                             count.
00 08 50 20  CC     Very good. You're going to use ASCS retro, and
                             manual proportional standby.


	Page 178
	PCS-6

00 08 50 26  P     That is affirmative. The handle is sitting in at
                          this time; I'll pull it out.
00 08 50 31  CC    Okay. Your attitudes look very good, Wally, and
                          your clock is 5 seconds fast. - So with the
                          present setting, we should time out right on
                          time.
00 08 50 39  P     Roger, Al. I've got - I'm coming up on 30 seconds
                          to go. I'll give you my light.
00 08 50 46  CC    Okay.
00 08 50 49  P     I've got the 5 minute light on. This is the 30
                          second light - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, LIGHT<sup>T</sup>
                          There it is. I've got a light and a tone. Tone
                          is out.
00 08 51 07 CC     Very good. The timing is right on, Wally. I'll
                          count down to retrosequence, and you'll arm the
                          squibs at 5.
00 08 51 14 P      That's correct.
00 08 51 22 CC     Here we go at 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.
00 08 51 28 P      Squib arm.
00 08 51 30 CC     3, 2, 1. SEQUENCE<sup>T</sup>.
00 08 51 34 P      I have sequence, and capsule is nice and tight.
                          Got attitude green. She sitting here like a
                          tight rock, Al.
00 08 51 42 CC     Roger, attitude looks very good from here, Wally.
00 08 51 44 P      Yeah. They looked beautiful here, too. Oh boy!
                          She's a good little capsule, I'll clue you.
00 08 51 52 CC     Here you go.
00 08 51 53 P      Roger.

00 08 51 57 CC     5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.<sup>T</sup>
00 08 52 04 P      I've got (retro rocket number) 1, and she's
                             holding real tight. Very tight. I got 2,
                             my attitudes are right on the money. I've
                             got 3.
00 08 52 17 CC     Very good. We confirm on T/M. Retros 1, 2,
                             and 3. Attitudes holding very well. Retro
                             jettison switch to arm.
00 08 52 24 P      Roger.
00 08 52 25 CC     Emergency retro jettison fuse switch is on.
00 08 52 28 P      Roger. They are all on. Retro jet is armed.
                             Got sunlight. Everybody's very happy. I'm
                             going to fly-by-wire, Al, to pitch to reentry
                             attitude. Manual is going in.
00 08 52 41 CC     And we show you have about 68 percent auto and
                             84 percent manual fuel left. I think our
                             readings are probably a little closer than yours.
00 08 52 50 P      I've got 68 (percent) auto and 78 (percent) manual.
00 08 52 56 CC     Roger.
00 08 53 00 P      Standing by for retro jett. I have retro jett,
                             and light is green. I could hear it by the way.
00 08 53 10 CC     Very good. We confirm retro jettison.
00 08 53 12  P     Okay. I am using fly-by-wire low to pitch up
                             to reentry attitude.
00 08 53 18  CC    Okay. We're following you here.
00 08 53 20  P     Roger. I am a little sloppy on the roll as you may
                             see. No strain. I'm going to put her right into
                             ASCS when I get up here. Okay. She's in reentry
                             as far as roll goes. Okay. The scope is coming
                             in. I'm on the gyros.

00 08 53 40 CC     Roger. We confirm scope retract on T/M.
00 08 53 43 P      Roger.
00 08 53 44 CC     And you're very close to reentry attitude.
00 08 53 47 P      Roger. I'm in reentry attitude now.
00 08 53 51 CC     Roger. Understand you will go to RSCS prior to
                            0.05g, with aux damp as a back up.
00 08 53 57 P      That is affirmative. I'm now going to ASCS at
                            this time. And she's tight and holding.
00 08 54 05 CC     Understand you are in ASCS.
00 08 54 07 P      That is correct. I want to see if the reentry
                            logic was in.
00 08 54 11 CC     Roger. And you will go to RSCS prior to 0.05g.
00 08 54 15 P      That is correct, Al. I want to give her a
                            checkout. Those retros were real cute, and
                            right on the money.
00 08 54 25 CC     Roger.
00 08 54 26 P      I'd say attitudes didn't vary 1 degree.
00 08 54 29 CC     Real tight. Real tight.
00 08 54 30 P      Righto. I think they're gonna put me on number
                            3 elevator.
00 08 54 35 CC     Ha, ha. Good show. Stand by I'll call the
                            Cape. See if they have anything.
00 08 54 39 P      Okay, Al.

00 08 54 49 P      Okay. Post retro, I read 65 (percent) auto
                              (fuel), and about - 78 (percent) manual (fuel).
                              Manual lever is in. I'm in ASCS at this time.
00 08 55 10 CC     Understand you are still in ASCS but the manual
                              lever is in.
00 08 55 14 P      That is correct. What is my nominal time for
                              0.05g.
00 08 55 19 CC     Standing by Wally. We have LOS. See you later.

00 08 56 57 CT     Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is Watertown
                              Com Tech. UHF. How do you read?
00 08 57 02 P      Roger. Watertown Com Tech this is Sigma Seven.
                              Read you loud and clear. How me?
00 08 57 07 CT     Sigma Seven this is Watertown Com Tech. I
                              read you weak, I read you weak. Please make
                              another transmission.
00 08 57 13 P      Roger. I read you loud and clear, Watertown.
                              How do you read me now?
00 08 57 19 CT     Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is Watertown

                              broken up. Please make another transmission.
00 08 57 27 P      Roger, Watertown. I read you loud and clear.
                              Please make your transmissions to me in the

00 08 57 55  CC     Sigma Seven this is Watertown Cap Com.
00 08 57 58  P      Roger. Watertown Cap Com. How do you read
                            me?
00 08 58 02  CC     Weak and unreadable, at the moment. But I
                            will transmit in the blind. Please check
                            to make sure your face plate is closed and
                            sealed. Do you read?
00 08 58 10  P      Roger. Face plate closed and sealed.
00 08 58 13  CC     Will you verify that your scope is fully
                            retracted and the door closed. Does it
                            look dark?
00 08 58 18  P      The scope is retracted, and I think you'll
                            have to confirm that for me.
00 08 58 23  CC     Understand - I just barely understood you,
                            but I'll go ahead. Will you confirm that
                            the UHF/DF switch is in the R/T position.
00 08 58 32  P      That is correct.
00 08 58 37  P      I am standing by to check out my RSCS mode
                            at the proper time.
00 08 58 47  CC     Sigma Seven. Did not understand the last
                            transmission but assume you read that we
                            should have UHF/DF switch in the R/T
                            position. I do not have any landing recovery
                            information for you at the moment, but I'll
                            pass it on to you if I can.
00 08 59 03  P      Roger. Have you acquired track?
00 08 59 09  CC     Expect LOS blackout anytime. I'll keep
                            transmitting in the hope that it will get it
                            on your tape recorder.

00 08 59 16  P     Roger.
00 08 59 22  CC    At main chute deploy if you get a chance,
                              will you shut off your three water controls
                              to help out the data reduction people?
00 08 59 28  P     Wilco. If I get a chance. Ha, ha.
00 08 59 36  CC    Sigma Seven. Don't forget to watch your
                              your cabin pressure and your altimeter.
                              If they do not check, pull your decompress
                              or your snorkle handle.
00 08 59 45  P     Roger. Understand.
00 08 59 50  CC    Sigma Seven. I'll keep on talking in the hope
                              that we can clear this blackout problem.
                              At 17K, your O<sub>2</sub> emergency light should come
                              on. At that time pull your snorkle.
00 09 00 01  P     Roger. Understand.
00 09 00 04  CC    You should have sent your blood pressure.
00 09 00 07  P     I did.
00 09 00 11  CC    I still have you on T/M. No blackout yet.
00 09 00 13  P     Roger. I'm going to check out rate command
                              at this time.
00 09 00 18  CC    Roger. Understand. Checking out rate command.
00 09 00 29  CC    Sigma Seven. Do you still read?
00 09 00 31  P     Sigma Seven. Read you loud and clear. How me?
00 09 00 34  CC    Clear.

00 09 00 40 CC     Wally, by the way, how do you feel? All your
                           systems okay at this time?
00 09 00 43 P      Oh, they're beautiful - very good. Every
                           control mode has worked perfectly.
00 09 00 53 CC     Lost you on T/M.
00 09 00 55 P      Roger.
00 09 01 19 P      I have selected aux damp and rate command at
                           this. The window is almost completely occluded.
                           It would be impossible to see out of it at
                           this point.
00 09 01 38 P      I'm seeing things come off, but I can't see them
                           very clearly. There we go into 0.05, a green.
                           I am hands off at this point. In rate command,
                           in aux damp. And I have a roll rate started.
                           A slight pitch rate, not bad at all. I can see
                           out the window for some strange reason at last.
                           There goes another long spiral like looking
                           device. I will give another blood pressure at
                           this point, subsequent to 0.05 g. All rates
                           are very nominal. Rate command is working quite
                           well I would say.
00 09 02 44 P      Going back into g-field. And the attitude looks
                           very stable. I'm rolling right around the
                           horizon. I'm going to stop my blood pressure
                           at this time - and sit back here and regroup.
                           I can see the ion layer. I'm inverted at this
                           time.
00 09 03 14 P      Attitudes are controlling very well. Seems to
                           be plenty of manual fuel. I'm still at 72
                           percent. Definitely has the cyclic rate in
                           pitch at this point. Yaw is fairly stiff; g
                           is building up. Capsule is quite stable.

                             There is a green flow - and looks like orange
                             streaks every once in a while. RSCS is doing
                             very well on reentry. Rather unusual slow
                             roll. Building up to 2g's. I have plenty of
                             fuel in rate command. Seeing sparkles coming
                             by now. A definite green glow, like a limeade;
                             g's building up. Oscillations are very good at
                             this point. About 3g.
00 09 04 18  P     Still in a relatively horizontal attitude. Rate
                             command working well. Glad she's holding.
                             Doing very well. Coming up to 5½ (g). Rate
                             command still holding, fuel is still 70 (percent),
                             seems low. Coming up to 6½ (g), 7g's. Coming
                             up to 8g. Rate command holding. Taking a
                             pretty big yaw out. Not too bad, I have it
                             pretty well. Manual (fuel) is 60 percent.
                             She's flying it very well.
00 09 05 29 P      Coming off. Peak-g was an indicated 7½ (g).
00 09 05 38 CC     I read you weak. How do you read?
00 09 05 40 P      Roger. Read you well, loud and clear. - I still
                             have about 3g on. Capsule performing very
                             well. Rate command holding pretty well.
                             Altimeter off the peg. Attitudes holding very
                             well.

00 09 06 05 CC     Sigma Seven this is Hawaii Cap Com.
00 09 06 07 P      Roger. Go ahead.
00 09 06 09 CC     Everything appears to be nominal.
00 09 06 11 P      Roger. Seems nominal here. Everything looks
                             good. Got 55 percent auto fuel. Passing
                             through 70,000 feet, 65,000. Attitudes are
                             very stable. Coming up on 60 (thousand). Rate

                           command doing very well. Coming up on
                           50 (thousand). She looks like a sweety.
                           Coming up on 45,000. I'm down to about
                           1 g. Preparing to punch the drogue, at
                           40, 41 (thousand). I'm punching drogue,
                           and the drogue is out. You can hear it; I
                           can't see it because of the clouds.
                           Attitudes are holding well. Manual lever
                           is in. RSCS fuel is going pretty fast. I
                           can see the drogue now. Drogue looks very
                           good. I'm going to aux damp to. Actually
                           don't need it. Rate command is burning itself
                           out. And aux damp is doing nothing, just
                           sitting there. I'll put in auto mode just to
                           let her pump out.
00 09 07 30 CC     - about 3 seconds.
00 09 07 31 P      Roger, I'm coming down on 20,000. Standing by
                           for snorkle. Cabin pressure is increasing.
                           Snorkle should go. I believe snorkle lid
                           blew. I felt them I will pull it anyway. I
                           have an emergency rate. I think I led the
                           snorkle a little bit on that one.
00 09 07 58 P      I'm dumping H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Switch fuse on. Standing
                           by. Recovery arm is "arm". Standing by for
                           main chute. All switches are in proper
                           position. Manual fuel is almost all gone.
                           There goes drogue and main is out. It's -
                           she's out beautiful. Bright blue sky. And
                           it's dereefed, and looks like a sweety pie.
                           Auto fuel is dumping. Rate of descent is
                           about 35 (fps) at this time. I see no problems
                           at all. I'm going to get prepared for impact.
                           Auto fuel is dumping out. Cabin pressure is
                           increasing properly. All systems look real
                           good. I am cool, I am not hot. Main chute looks
                           delightful. Rate of descent is 35 feet per
                           second. I have no reason to select anything else.
                           Landing bag is out.

00 09 09 09 CC     Roger, Wally. How do you feel?
00 09 09 10 P      I feel marvelous. This is a beautiful flight,
                             wasn't it?
00 09 09 15 CC     Understand, you feel marvelous.
00 09 09 18 P      That is affirmative. I'm opening visor at this
                             time to relieve my ears?
00 09 09 26 CC     Did you get the weather in the recovery area?
00 09 09 29 P      I probably had too much to say. What do you
                             fellows have?
00 09 09 32 CC     Roger. Weather is 2,000 broken, visibility
                             10 miles, 3 foot seas. We don't have any
                             tracked IP yet but you should be very close to
                             the Kearsarge.
00 09 09 42 P      Roger. Sounds good, Gus. It's a beautiful
                             chute here. I want to get a good description
                             out before we got into the - the drink here.
                             I'm preparing for impact by disconnecting the
                             visor hose.
00 09 10 01 CC     What's your altitude, Wally?
00 09 10 03 P      Say again.
00 09 10 06 CC     Altitude?
00 09 10 07 P      I'm now at about 6,000 feet.
00 09 10 12 CC     Understand, 6,000.
00 09 10 13 P      That's correct. I'm not rolling at all on this
                             chute. Okay I've got that darn visor hose
                             off, and the Velcro strap loose. Visor seal is
                             dumped. I take off the exit hose from the
                             helmet - and stuff that up in the toolies. I'm
                             not even hot here, Gus.

00 09 10 55  CC      You say it's hot.
00 09 10 56  P       I am not hot. I am very comfortable.
00 09 11 01  CC      Say again here. Just don't read.
00 09 11 03  P       I am very comfortable.
00 09 11 07  CC      Talk slow. You come in clear then.
00 09 11 09  P       Roger. I am very comfortable.
00 09 11 14  CC      Very good. We understand.
00 09 11 17  P       I want to stay aboard.
00 09 11 22  CC      . . ..
00 09 11 24  P       I am turning off ASCS bus. I'm going to get
                             rid of these coolant valves that the fellows
                             wanted, they're all going to 0. And I hear
                             the aux beacon already.
00 09 11 58 CC       . . ..
00 09 13 06 P        I am about ready to impact now. I'm just about
                             on the water.
00 09 13 46 P        Oh! stay dry baby.
00 09 13 52 P        Okay. It's taking a while to right itself
                             but I think I've got the small end out of the
                             water here. Can you read? Over.
00 09 14 01 FlagPlot <sup>2</sup> Roger. Sigma Seven. Flag Plot. Are you stable
                             and on the water?

00 09 14 05  P     Looks like I'm stable on the water. The
                              whip antenna is up. I can see it. I
                              will switch to whip antenna.
00 09 14 13  P     I am definitely canted over pretty far, but
                              there seems to be no water in the capsule,
                              and I am very comfortable. She is righting
                              herself very nicely, at this time.
00 09 14 23  CC    Roger. Carrier has you visual and the helos
                              are on their way.
00 09 14 28  P     How about that? That's great.
00 09 14 32  CC    Do you still feel better?
00 09 14 33  P     Oh! I always feel better. There, she's
                              getting nice and straight now.
00 09 14 42  CC    Say again, Wally.
00 09 14 45  P     She's getting up there nice and straight now.
00 09 14 49  CC    Talk very slowly. I have difficulty reading.
00 09 14 51  P     Okay. She's almost erect in the water at this
                              time. I'm going to put up the whip antenna,
                              Gus, and turn the squibs off. Standby.
00 09 15 05  CC    I'm sorry, Wally. I didn't read that.
00 09 15 09  P     Okay. I have put the whip antenna up, and I'm
                              turning off the arm squibs.
00 09 15 17  CC    Whip antenna is up. You're turning off the
                              squib arm.
00 09 15 20  P     That is correct.
00 09 15 22  P     Okay. I'm going to check the cockpit, to be
                              sure we don't get the boys in trouble.
                              Everything looks real good, Gus. This is a real
                              sweetie pie of a capsule.

00 09 15 34  CC    Roger. I agree.
00 09 15 36  P     I am in comfort, absolute complete comfort.
                           The suit inlet is now 72 (degrees), the
                           cabin is about 98 (degrees). That's all.
                           I feel very comfortable.
00 09 15 51  CC    Roger. Repeat the last part before the very
                           comfortable.
00 09 15 55  P     The suit inlet temperature is 72 - 72 (degrees).
                           The cabin temperature is 98 - 98 (degrees).
                           I'm going to retract the scope manually to
                           get it out of the way for the boys when they
                           come around.
00 09 16 27  CC    Wally. You landed about 9,000 yards from the
                           carrier. How about that?
00 09 16 30  P     That's pretty close isn't it?
00 09 17 33  P     Boy this is a sweet little bird. I just can't
                           get over it.
00 09 18 10  CC    Wally. Hawaii Cap Com.
00 09 18 12  P     Go ahead.
00 09 18 16  CC    Recovery has been advised of your status.
                           You're comfortable. They see the whip antenna,
                           and they are on the way.
00 09 18 22  P     Very good. I am very comfortable.

                           today?

00 09 18 40  R1    Fine, fine. Got your squibs off. Give me
                             a short count, please.
00 09 18 44  P     Roger. A short count follows: 1 2 3 4 5
                             5 4 3 2 1. This is Astro. Sigma Seven.
                             Very happy to be back in the Pacific league.
00 09 18 57  R1    Good. Glad to be able to talk to you.
00 09 19 00  P     Oh, it's a good habit.
00 09 19 06  R1    Hello Astro this is Swiss One. We have you on
                             sight. You're looking good from here, on
                             the green dye.
00 09 19 16  P     Roger, I seem to be bathing in it, don't I?
00 09 19 20  R1    Roger. I'm going to fly overhead, come back
                             around and drop the swimming team.
00 09 19 23  P     Okay. Good show.
00 09 19 32  R1    Wally. You look fine.
00 09 19 34  P     Good show. How's it? She looks pretty erect
                             to me. She's canted off a little bit towards
                             what would be my left side. Is that correct?
00 09 19 42  R1    That's affirmative.
00 09 19 43  P     Roger.
00 09 19 46  R1    Okay. We're going, now coming in with the
                             swimmers.
00 09 19 48  P     Roger, Swiss One.
00 09 19 54  P     I can hear you now.
00 09 19 55  R1    Roger. You've got four helicopters overhead.
00 09 19 59  P     Oh, that'll do.

00 09 20 18 P      Tell the fellows I am perfectly comfortable.
                           I can wait as long as they want.
00 09 20 22 R1     Understand.
00 09 20 23 P      Okay. Don't tell them. Don't let them get
                           their hands cut on something on here - go at
                           it casually.
00 09 20 30 R1     Roger.
00 09 20 31 P      Thank you.
00 09 21 12 R1     Okay, Astro. The swimmers are in the water.
00 09 21 14 P      Roger.
00 09 21 30 P      I see a little old string hanging along down
                           the side here. Oh! That's my dye marker.
00 09 21 36 R1     I see your die marker, is very bright green.
00 09 21 39 P      Yeah. I can see it through part of my window.
                           Apparently, what I was looking at was the
                           piece of string and that was the dye marker.
                           Howdy fellows!
00 09 21 51 P      Do they know I'm all right. I assume, I heard
                           them knock on the capsule.
00 09 21 54 R1     Astro. Understand you requested you - you want
                           to remain in the capsule? You want to know if
                           we know that?
00 09 22 00 P      I assume they do. Don't they?
00 09 22 03 R1     Right.
00 09 22 15 R1     Astro. This is the Swiss pilot. The carrier
                           is about three quarters of a mile - closing.

	REC-6

00 09 22 24 P      Okay, pilot. I think I would prefer to stay in
                             and have a - a small boat come alongside and
                             using your collar routine, of course, to
                             support me, and having a ship pickup. Over.
00 09 22 38 R1     Roger. Understand. You want ships small boat.
                             Will give them that word right away.
00 09 22 41 P      Okay. I think they are briefed to make a -
                             attachment with a small boat and then hoist me
                             aboard.
00 09 22 51 R1     Please say again, the last.
00 09 22 54 P      I understand that this is the Kearsarge, is that
                             correct?
00 09 22 57 R1     Affirmative.
00 09 22 59 P      She is briefed, I understand, to bring me and
                             the capsule aboard together.
00 09 23 05 R1     I'll wait one.
00 09 23 06 P      Okay.
